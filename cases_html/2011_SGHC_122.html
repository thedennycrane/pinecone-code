        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The first plaintiff is The Stansfield Group Pte
                    Ltd. Until 3 January 2007, the first plaintiff was the owner of two private
                    educational organisations (“PEOs”), <em>viz</em> Stansfield College (“Stansfield”) and
                    Singapore Institute of Commerce (“SIC”), which offered tertiary
                    education to local and foreign students. On 3 January 2007, the first
                    plaintiff transferred SIC to the second plaintiff, SIC College of Business and
                    Technology Pte Ltd. On 5 April 2008, the first plaintiff transferred
                    Stansfield to one of its subsidiary companies, Stansfield College Group Pte Ltd.
                    I will hereafter sometimes refer to Stansfield and SIC collectively as
                    “the schools”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, Consumers’
                    Association of Singapore (“CASE”), is a society registered with
                    the Registry of Societies. Its principal aim is the protection of the interests
                    of consumers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The second defendant is NTUC Income Insurance
                    Co-operative Limited (“Income”). It is a co-operative society
                    registered with the Registry of Co-operative Societies and is in the insurance
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs have made claims against both
                    defendants in tort and contract. As against CASE, their claim is for the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that the Notices of
                        Suspension of Case Trust Membership dated 20 November 2006 issued by
                        CASE to the schools were unlawful and void;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     the sum of $107,523.84 as special damages;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     damages to
                            be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As against Income, their claim is for the
                    same amount of $107,523.84 as special damages and also for damages to be
                    assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       One of CASE’s functions is to administer
                    various accreditation schemes with the objective of encouraging businesses in
                    the service and retail industries in Singapore to be more consumer-friendly and
                    to adopt fair business practices. One such accreditation scheme is directed at
                    the private education business and is known as CaseTrust for
                Education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       CaseTrust for Education was developed as part of
                    the “Education Excellence Framework” launched by the Economic
                    Development Board in September 2004 which was aimed at developing Singapore as a
                    world class education hub. One important purpose of the Education Excellence
                    Framework was to ensure that the welfare of foreign students in Singapore was
                    protected so as to attract them to Singapore. From 1 September 2005, all
                    PEOs in Singapore that wished to enrol foreign students had to possess a valid
                    CaseTrust for Education membership. To ensure that this requirement was met,
                    from that date, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”)
                    did not issue student passes to foreign students who enrolled in PEOs that were
                    not members of CaseTrust for Education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       One of the key requirements for a PEO that
                    wishes to acquire membership in CaseTrust for Education is that it has in place
                    arrangements that satisfy the Student Protection Scheme (the
                    “Scheme”). The Scheme was devised to protect foreign students
                    against losing their tuition fees paid to a PEO by reason of the insolvency or
                    premature closure of such PEO. There are two methods of protecting student fees
                    under the Scheme. PEOs participating in the Scheme must either:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     deposit no less than 70% of each
                        foreign student’s tuition fees in an escrow arrangement with a
                        participating bank (“the escrow option”);
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     take out an
                        insurance policy from a participating insurer to provide each foreign
                        student with insurance coverage for no less than 70% of the tuition fees
                        paid by the student (“the insurance
                option”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At all material times, Income participated in
                    the Scheme by providing insurance cover under the insurance option. It was the
                    only insurer in Singapore to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first plaintiff decided to choose for the
                    insurance option. It applied to Income for cover in late 2004. At the time of
                    application, the first plaintiff provided Income with its audited financial
                    statements and other information. Income then commissioned Dun &amp; Bradstreet
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Dun &amp; Bradstreet”) to perform financial
                    due diligence on the first plaintiff to determine its financial stability and
                    assess the commercial risks of insuring Stansfield’s and SIC’s
                    students. In late November 2004, the first plaintiff’s financial condition
                    was found to be fair. On 1 December 2004, Income issued two separate master
                    insurance policies, one for each of Stansfield and SIC, <em>viz</em> policies number 1000000021 and 1000000022 (each an
                    “SPS policy”). The aggregate maximum insurable limit under these
                    policies was initially $5m. It was later increased to $8m based partly on the
                    security of two banker’s guarantees which the first plaintiff provided to
                    Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Sometime in 2005, the schools applied for
                    membership in CaseTrust for Education and were assessed by CASE’s
                    independent assessors to determine their eligibility. During the assessment,
                    both schools were required to furnish evidence of their participation in the
                    Scheme. They did so by providing CASE with copies of the SPS policies. On
                    25 August 2005, Stansfield became an accredited member of CaseTrust for
                    Education and SIC acquired the same status the next day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Documentation relating to CaseTrust for Education</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Various agreements and documents were
                    presented to me as governing the relationship between CASE (as the administrator
                    of CaseTrust for Education) and the schools (as member PEOs of CaseTrust for
                    Education).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     First, there is The Code of Practice for
                    CaseTrust Members (“the Code of Practice”). This is a generic code
                    that sets out the good business practices expected of members of CaseTrust. It
                    applies generally to CaseTrust members across all industries and is not
                    specifically designed for members of CaseTrust for Education. It does not
                    contain any specific reference to CaseTrust for Education or the Scheme. Clause
                    10 of the Code of Practice sets out the sanctions that may be imposed by CASE in
                    the event that a PEO breaches the Code or other terms and conditions of
                    membership:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">10</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">SANCTIONS FOR BREACH OF THIS CODE</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">10.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Where CaseTrust becomes aware that a breach of
                            this code or other terms and conditions of membership has taken place,
                            CaseTrust will provide an opportunity for the member to answer the
                            allegations.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">10.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If CaseTrust concludes after its independent
                            investigation that a breach of this code has occurred, it may impose
                            such penalties as may be specified or as may be appropriate in the
                            circumstance, including but not limited to warnings, fines and/or
                            expulsion or a combination of such. Expulsion if required, may be
                            brought to the public’s attention through the media and will
                            involve the immediate withdrawal of all the rights and privileges of a
                            member. In this regard members will render full co-operation to the
                            CaseTrust Secretariat in its investigation including access to
                            information related to its investigation through documents and
                            interviews with staff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Second, a CaseTrust Information and
                    Application Kit (“the Info-Kit”) was sent to the schools in 2005
                    when they were applying for membership in CaseTrust. The Info-Kit was also
                    available on CASE’s website. It provides general information, forms and
                    checklists on CaseTrust for Education and sets out the terms and conditions
                    governing membership. It also sets out the criteria that any PEO has to meet if
                    it wishes to become an accredited member of CaseTrust for
                Education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Info-Kit explains the importance of the
                    Scheme to CaseTrust for Education. It states (at para 9 of Chapter 2) that
                    a PEO that achieves CaseTrust for Education will have in place the Scheme to
                    protect the student’s tuition fees in the event that the PEO is unable to
                    continue operations due to adverse situations such as insolvency. The two
                    methods of protection prescribed by the Scheme are set out in para 12 of
                    Chapter 3 and the insurance option is explained at para 16 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Student Tuition Fee Insurance indemnifies students for their tuition
                        fees paid in advance to the PEO for the following events:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a. When circumstances listed in Paragraph 11 occur [<em>ie</em> the PEO cannot continue operations due to insolvency or
                        regulatory closure], or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b. Upon death or total permanent disability of the student.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Info-Kit states that a PEO must enter into
                    an escrow arrangement or an insurance agreement under the Scheme in order to
                    qualify for membership of CaseTrust for Education. Under “C. Practices
                    and Systems” criterion C15 of the Info-Kit states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Student Protect Scheme</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">C15.  The PEO must have a Student Protection Scheme in
                            the form of a Student Tuition Fee Account (Escrow) (Refer to <b><u>Annex B</u></b> for Master Escrow Agreement that PEOs
                            and students would have to comply with) or a Student Tuition Fee
                            Insurance (Refer to <b><u>Annex C</u></b> for Master
                            Insurance Policy that PEOs would have to comply with and students would
                            need to be signed up and be insured).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Criterion C15 appears as part of a checklist
                    intended to facilitate assessment of PEOs who are applying for accreditation.
                    The applicant PEO has to indicate in a box next to criterion C15 whether or not
                    it has a Student Tuition Fee Account (Escrow) endorsed by CASE or whether it has
                    a Student Tuition Fee Insurance endorsed by CASE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Info-Kit explains to PEOs the consequences
                    of a breach of the terms and conditions of membership. Chapter 7 of the Info-Kit
                    states, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">44.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Members are required to maintain the CaseTrust
                            standards as stated, among other things, in the Assessment Criteria
                            provided. The criteria may be revised from time to time and the Members
                            must be so bound by such.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">47.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In order to uphold the standards, which may be

                            breach/infringement of the Code of Practice.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">49.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Applicant has been made aware of the CaseTrust

                            appropriate means.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Third, on 10 January 2005, CASE entered into
                    an agreement (“the CASE-PEO agreement”) with each of the schools.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The “Student Contract” referred
                    to in the CASE-PEO agreement is defined in cl 1.1 thereof as being a
                    “standard student contract duly approved by CASE made or to be made
                    between a Student and the PEO relating to his/her course of studies with the
                    PEO”. In cll 3.1 and 3.2 of each standard student contract, the PEO
                    undertakes to the student that it has in place a scheme (<em>ie</em> either the escrow option or the insurance option) for the
                    student’s protection and that it will procure insurance coverage for the
                    student in accordance with the framework of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Documentation and procedure relating to the insurance
                scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 9 September 2004, Income entered into a
                    Master Insurance Agreement with CASE under which it agreed to provide insurance
                    facilities in respect of the Scheme to qualified PEOs who had applied for such
                    insurance. Clause 2.6 of this agreement gave Income absolute discretion to, at
                    any time, decline insurance cover to any PEO and/or any student as well as to
                    impose loading or other conditions in respect of any insurance policy granted to
                    PEOs under the insurance scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As stated above, Income issued two SPS
                    policies to the first plaintiff in December 2004. Under SPS policy number
                    1000000021, which was in respect of the first plaintiff trading as Stansfield,
                    the maximum insurable limit was $2m in the aggregate, and under SPS policy
                    number 1000000022, which was in respect of the first plaintiff trading as SIC,
                    the maximum insurable limit was $1.5m in the aggregate. Apart from the
                    difference in insurable limits, the terms of both SPS policies were identical.
                    Each policy stated that in consideration of the payment of the premium
                    prescribed by Income for each insured student, it would provide the benefits
                    stated in the policy for the insured students subject to the maximum limits of
                    liability prescribed in the individual Certificate of Student Insurance issued
                    to each insured student covered by the policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Under the Terms and Conditions of each SPS
                    policy, the term “Maximum Insurable Limit” was defined as meaning
                    the sum (as revised by Income from time to time) stated in the Schedule to the
                    SPS policy to be the maximum insurable limit for that policy in respect of all
                    insured students covered or to be covered under the policy from time to time.
                    Conditions 6 and 7 of the SPS policies are important. They provide:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The SPS policies stated that the
                    administration agency for the insurance services provided by Income would be a
                    company called Aegis Insurance Service Pte Ltd (“Aegis”). Aegis
                    was given the job of handling all administration matters arising in the
                    operation and management of student protection policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The schools were required by Income to submit
                    an individual insurance application for each student they wished to protect
                    under the SPS policies. Each insurance application had to contain the relevant
                    particulars of the individual student applicant including his passport details,
                    course of study and tuition fees. Insurance applications were done online via
                    Income’s online insurance application system using login IDs and passwords
                    issued to the schools. The online insurance application system was the only way
                    that Stansfield and SIC could apply for insurance cover for their students. At
                    the time an application was keyed-in, the system would generate details of the
                    premium payable in respect of such application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     So long as the Maximum Insurable Limit for a
                    school had not been reached, when that school made an insurance application via
                    the online application system, the application would be transmitted to Aegis.
                    Aegis would then proceed to generate the necessary documents. No further
                    instructions would be received from Income as to whether the application had
                    been accepted or not. The documents that would be generated were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     a letter of insurance confirmation
                        for ICA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     an
                        individual Certificate of Student Insurance for the student applicant;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     a debit
                            note in respect of the application for insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These documents would be released to the
                    plaintiffs by Aegis upon collection of the premium payable. A staff member from
                    the schools would, ordinarily, attend at the offices of Aegis to make payment by
                    way of cheque and collect the relevant documents. It bears repeating that once
                    an online application had been properly keyed into the system and the
                    application was within the Maximum Insurable Limit, it was automatically
                    accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties and their representatives</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At all material times, one Mr Kannappan
                    s/o Karuppan Chettiar (“Mr Chettiar”) was a director and the
                    chairman of both the plaintiffs. His wife, Ms Cenobia Majella, was a
                    co-director of the plaintiffs. In November 2005, as the first plaintiff was
                    expanding its business, Mr Chettiar recruited Mr Ken Yeo Poh Siah
                    (“Mr Yeo”) and Dr Joseph Pious
                    (“Dr Pious”) to join the key management team. Between
                    November 2005 and December 2006, Mr Yeo was the Group Registrar responsible
                    for the administration of student matters, records and operations. Dr Pious
                    was employed as the Chief Executive Officer of the first
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In January 2006, Mr Yeo established a new
                    department in the first plaintiff called the “Student Pass
                    Office”. This office was responsible for handling and administering the
                    student pass applications of students from both schools. The office had two
                    dedicated employees: one each in Stansfield (Clari in January 2000) and SIC
                    (Julie, in January 2006). Clari and Julie were replaced by Vernice and Nura
                    sometime in April or May 2006 and these employees were in turn replaced by
                    Farida and Noraini sometime in August 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The department in CASE responsible for the
                    administration of the CaseTrust scheme is the CaseTrust Secretariat. Within that
                    department, the head of CaseTrust for Education was a Ms Shennon Khong. At
                    the material time, Shennon Khong was assisted by Ms Angela Lee
                    (“Ms Lee”), an executive who reported to her on all matters
                    relating to CaseTrust for Education. Ms Lee’s duties included
                    processing applications and renewals of CaseTrust membership, conducting due
                    diligence checks on CaseTrust applicants and members and dealing with queries
                    relating to CaseTrust. One of her responsibilities was to periodically check
                    with the banks and Income on the number of students protected by an escrow or
                    insurance arrangement, and also to check with the ICA on the number of student
                    passes issued to determine whether there were any discrepancies in the
                    figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At the material time, Mr Seah Seng Choon
                    (“Mr Seah”) was the executive director of CASE. He, however,
                    was out of the office travelling during much of the period in 2006 when the
                    events that this case is concerned with occurred. At that time, Shennon Khong
                    was away on maternity leave. Therefore, Ms Lee, who covered most of
                    Ms Khong’s day-to-day duties, handled the interactions with the
                    plaintiffs and Income on behalf of CASE. She sought advice and guidance from
                    Thevanathan Pillay (“Mr Pillay”) who held the post of
                    Assistant Director (Legal). Mr Pillay was the legal adviser to the
                    CaseTrust Secretarial and advised it on all legal matters relating to CaseTrust.
                    In Mr Seah’s absence, he was also responsible for disciplinary
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The person in Income who was involved in the
                    events leading to this action was Mr Teo Chin Poh Terence
                    (“Mr Teo”). At the material time, he was the Head of the
                    Property and Casualty Department of Income. He was in charge of the management
                    of the two SPS policies entered into between the plaintiffs and Income. In this
                    connection, he was in close and regular contact with Mr Tay Kong Suan
                    Richard, a director of Aegis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the suspension of the schools’ CaseTrust
                membership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Around the end of September 2006 while
                    reviewing all student records, the plaintiffs identified 23 international
                    students, all of whom seemed to have been issued with valid student passes
                    without any corresponding application or payment for insurance having been made
                    to Income. On or about 6 October 2006, Mr Yeo, having received
                    confirmation that those students did not have insurance cover, instructed his
                    staff to make the necessary applications for such insurance cover. On
                    14 October 2006, the first plaintiff sent Income 23 insurance applications
                    accompanied by two cheques in payment of the premiums for the same. On
                    10 November 2006, however, Aegis wrote to the first plaintiff stating that
                    there were no records of outstanding bills relating to those cheques. It
                    returned the cheques under cover of the said letter and reminded the first
                    plaintiff that correspondence and documents in respect applications under the
                    SPS policies had to be sent via Aegis and not directly to Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This episode was peculiar because neither
                    school had reached its Maximum Insurable Limit and therefore if the applications
                    had been made properly, they should have been accepted and the premiums would
                    have been due to Income. At the time the plaintiffs attempted to make the
                    applications, the online application system had not been altered in any way and
                    was available to the plaintiffs. It would therefore appear (and the evidence
                    seems to support) that the reason for this rejection was that the
                    plaintiffs’ staff had not keyed in the applications correctly when using
                    the online application system so that the applications had not been received by
                    Income or Aegis and Aegis had not generated the usual documents in respect
                    thereof. That was why there was no record of any amount being due from the
                    plaintiffs. Further, the plaintiffs had not followed the usual procedure in that
                    they had not attended at Aegis’ office with their cheques to hand over the
                    same in exchange for the confirmation letters for ICA and the Certificates of
                    Insurance for the students. Instead, they had sent the cheques directly to
                    Income accompanied by print-outs of the applications that they had tried to make
                    for their various students.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 16 October 2006, Ms Lee received
                    a telephone call from an officer of the Singapore Tourism Board
                    (“STB”) who informed her that there was some market talk regarding
                    Stansfield’s and SIC’s financial status. At Ms Lee’s
                    request, this call was followed the same day by an e-mail from the STB which was
                    copied to various other agencies as well and stated, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... we have some market intelligence that SIC/Stansfield are in
                        trouble.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There’s market talk that the group has been badly burnt in their
                        investment overseas and would be seeking court order to declare themselves
                        as bankrupt. If it’s true, the fallout would be tremendous as
                        it’s a SQC PEO and from our website status, the two institutions have
                        more than 700 international student registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Shortly thereafter, Ms Lee received
                    another e-mail from the STB which asked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Is it possible for CASE to check with the banks (on escrow default) and/or
                        NTUC Income on whether they can commence a financial health check on the
                        school as part of their regular insurance process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Was told that the SPS providers can give us good tell-tale signs of the
                        PEO’s financial status and whether they are likely to pull
                        through.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Ms Lee was concerned about potential
                    problems relating to the plaintiffs’ CaseTrust membership and decided to
                    commence an investigation into the plaintiffs’ compliance with the Scheme.
                    This investigation involved checking with both Income and ICA on the number of
                    insurance policies purchased by the plaintiffs and the number of student passes
                    that had been issued. On 19 October 2006, Ms Lee sent an e-mail to
                    Mr Teo informing Income that CASE was investigating SIC and Stansfield and
                    wanted certain information from Income including the number of insurance
                    policies applied for by both schools over the preceding eight months, whether
                    the premiums of all students had been fully paid and how the students would be
                    protected in the event that the schools were to close down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On 20 October 2006, Mr Teo responded by,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, asking Ms Lee about the
                    nature of CASE’s investigation. Ms Lee’s e-mail in reply sent
                    out the same morning stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As there was a tip off that both the schools may be closing down soon due
                        to losses incurred during their investments in India, we need more concrete
                        evidence to substantiate the rumors [<em>sic</em>] are
                        true.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">CaseTrust, together with those governing agencies are highly concerned at
                        this stage. All being stakeholders, we need to be prepared for the worst,
                        especially when both the schools are classified as SQC-PEO.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any case, we looking [<em>sic</em>] forward to
                        receiving the requested information, and would appreciate if you could
                        revert with further comments on the above soon. Thanks!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Mr Teo then checked and discovered that
                    Stansfield had not made any online insurance applications for eight months (from
                    March 2006 to October 2006) whilst SIC had not done so for the six months
                    between May 2006 and October 2006. This was unusual in view of the size and
                    scale of the plaintiffs’ organisation. Further, the total value of the
                    policies issued to the schools’ students was below the Maximum Insurable
                    Limits. At that time, the Maximum Insurable Limits of the SPS policies totalled
                    $6m and the value of the actual policies issued totalled $711,660. This left a
                    further sum of $5,288,340 available for utilisation by the
                schools.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Teo explained to the court that upon
                    ascertaining the above information, he had the following concerns:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     that there was a genuine possibility
                        that the plaintiffs might be in financial distress which could expose Income
                        to considerable financial risk;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Income did not have sufficient information at that stage
                        to manage its risk exposure with respect to the SPS policies;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     CASE was
                        investigating the plaintiffs and he believed that Income should not take any
                        action which might alert plaintiffs to those investigations and potentially
                        compromise the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Teo then decided that the best way
                    forward would be to freeze all new insurance applications from the plaintiffs
                    pending CASE’s investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At about 10pm on 20 October 2006, Mr Teo
                    sent an e-mail to CASE stating that Income had not received any new applications
                    from Stansfield or SIC for more than six months. The e-mail went on to
                    state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the current investigations by CASETRUST, we will suspend with
                        immediate effect our bond facility to SIC and its affiliated schools till
                        further notice from you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A copy of the e-mail was sent to
                    Aegis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     According to Mr Teo, the suspension
                    referred to in his e-mail was the freezing of all new applications for insurance
                    cover under the Scheme by the plaintiffs. This was effected by resetting the
                    plaintiffs’ login password to Income’s online insurance application
                    system. This resetting was effected on 23 October 2006. Income did not
                    inform the plaintiffs of what it had done. It should also be noted here that
                    Ms Lee’s position was that when she read Mr Teo’s e-mail
                    informing her about the suspension of the “bond facility” she did
                    not understand that he meant that Income was suspending its insurance facilities
                    to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the meantime, on 19 October 2006,
                    Ms Lee had also asked the ICA to inform her of the number of student passes
                    issued to students of Stansfield and SIC over the previous six months. On
                    26 October 2006, she was given the “stock figures” for the
                    schools and on 3 November 2006, the ICA provided the “flow
                    figures” (<em>ie</em> the number of new student
                    passes issued during the period). Having received this information from ICA, she
                    proceeded to compare it with the information given to her by Income. Ms Lee
                    then discovered that there were substantial discrepancies between the number of
                    insurance policies applied for by the schools and the number of student passes
                    issued by the ICA. During the period between April 2006 and September 2006, the
                    ICA had issued 229 student passes to students in Stansfield and 297 passes to
                    students in SIC. During the same period, the plaintiffs had not applied for any
                    policies for Stansfield students and had only applied for 47 policies for SIC
                    students. This meant that 229 Stansfield students and 250 SIC students were,
                    apparently, not covered by any insurance policy under the Scheme during the
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On or about 9 November 2006, the plaintiffs
                    made several attempts to access Income’s online insurance application
                    system. The plaintiffs attempted to follow up with Income and, according to
                    Mr Yeo, were informed that the telephone operator was not aware of the
                    Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 14 November 2006, CASE wrote to Stansfield
                    and SIC informing them of the discrepancies it had found and asking for an
                    explanation to be given on or before 23 November 2006. It should be noted
                    that these letters (“14 November letters”) were sent by post.
                    The letter to Stansfield was put to the attention of Mr Chettiar. It
                    informed Stansfield that between April and September 2006, 229 student passes
                    had been issued and no insurance applications had been submitted and therefore
                    there was a total shortfall of 229. It further stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the Students’ Protection Scheme (SPS), the total number of
                        SPS’ [<em>sic</em>] accounts opened under your
                        school should exceed the total number of valid student passes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the above, kindly let us have your comments on the shortfall of
                        the total number of SPS’ [<em>sic</em>] accounts
                        by no later than <b><u>23 November 2006</u></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We look forward to your earliest reply. Thank you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The letter to SIC was put to the attention of
                    Mr Yeo and, apart from the difference in figures (the total shortfall being
                    250), the wording was identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 17 November 2006, CASE sent Income copies
                    of the 14 November letters. Mr Teo, having read these letters, found
                    that it was clear to him that the plaintiffs had failed to insure all of their
                    international students. He said that this was a great concern to him. It was one
                    thing not to purchase any insurance over a period of time, it was another thing
                    to enrol students but omit to purchase insurance policies to cover them. This
                    would nullify the protection intended to be provided by the Scheme. Mr Teo
                    found the information particularly worrying because it gave credit to the
                    tip-off that the plaintiffs might be in financial distress. In his view, there
                    were important questions on the plaintiffs’ financial condition which
                    needed to be answered so that Income could assess its options. The possible
                    options were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     to choose to reduce the Maximum
                        Insurable Limits of the SPS policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     to require them to provide more security to maintain the
                        current Maximum Insurable Limits of the SPS policies; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     to terminate the SPS policies
                        altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Teo informed the court that he did not
                    wish to take any of the above steps without investigation and he therefore
                    decided to continue the freezing of the insurance facilities in respect of new
                    applications until the conclusion of CASE’s investigation or until
                    Income’s questions on the state of the plaintiffs’ finances could be
                    fully answered. He considered that since CASE had now asked the plaintiffs for
                    an explanation for the discrepancies, Income could proceed to give the
                    plaintiffs notice of this freezing action as such notice would no longer
                    threaten or compromise CASE’s investigation. Consequently, on
                    17 November 2006, Mr Teo sent an e-mail to Aegis instructing them to
                    proceed to notify the plaintiffs of the freezing of the insurance facilities. He
                    sent a copy of this e-mail to CASE to inform it of Income’s
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     CASE received Mr Teo’s e-mail at
                    6.16pm on 17 November 2006. That was a Friday. Ms Lee immediately informed
                    Mr Pillay about the suspension of the insurance facilities. They agreed
                    with each other that this was a serious matter as the suspension of the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance facilities meant that newly enrolled students and
                    current students without insurance coverage could not be protected under the
                    Scheme. However, they decided to postpone making any decision as to what should
                    be done until after the weekend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the morning of Monday, 20 November
                    2006, Ms Lee and Mr Pillay resumed their discussion on the plaintiffs.
                    According to Ms Lee’s testimony, they agreed that this was an urgent
                    situation which necessitated CASE responding promptly with appropriate measures.
                    They also decided that in order to safeguard the interests of the students,
                    unless the plaintiffs’ insurance facilities were restored by Income by the
                    end of that day, the schools’ membership in CaseTrust for Education would
                    be suspended as an interim measure pending resolution of the matter. They agreed
                    that CASE could no longer afford to give the schools until 23 November 2006
                    to explain the discrepancies as a change in circumstances had taken place on
                    17 November 2006, <em>ie</em>, the schools no longer
                    had any valid insurance facilities under the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     That same morning, Mr Tay of Aegis sent
                    an e-mail addressed to Mr Chettiar and Ms Majella at their respective
                    e-mail addresses and copied to Mr Teo and two other employees of Aegis. The
                    e-mail was sent out at 9.38am and the subject heading was “SIC –
                    Notification of Suspension of SPS Facility”. The e-mail read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Mr Chettiar</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NTUC Income has been informed by CASE that there is an ongoing
                        investigation on the Stansfield Group of schools.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For this reason, please be informed that NTUC Income’s insurance
                        facility for all your schools under the Student Protection Scheme will be
                        suspended with immediate effect until further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you have any query regarding this matter, please contact us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At that time, Mr Chettiar and
                    Ms Majella were in India. Mr Chettiar testified that he did not see
                    the e-mail until about 12.30pm Indian time or about 3pm Singapore time. He then
                    instructed Ms Majella to forward the e-mail to Mr Yeo, Dr Pious
                    and another senior employee of the plaintiffs, Mr Ramel Ang
                    (“Mr Ang”), and she did so at 3.11pm Singapore
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I must now relate what happened as between the
                    plaintiffs and CASE on 20 November 2006. The parties have rather different
                    accounts of what occurred and I will deal with this separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ version</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiffs’ position is that
                    although the 14 November letters were received in their offices on
                    18 November 2006 (Saturday), Mr Yeo did not see the letter addressed
                    to SIC until the morning of 20 November 2006. It is not clear when
                    Dr Pious read the letter addressed to Stansfield as he did not testify. In
                    any event, Mr Yeo’s evidence was that the first he knew of the
                    discrepancies was when he read the 14 November letter to SIC on that Monday
                    morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Yeo said that when he came across the
                    letter, he was a bit taken aback by it. Until then, he had been under the
                    impression that there were only 23 students who had been issued student visas
                    without the required insurance policies. He was perturbed to find out that in
                    fact 250 students were not covered and he immediately telephoned Ms Lee to
                    seek further clarification on the 14 November letter. This was at about
                    10am.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     During the telephone conversation, Ms Lee
                    informed Mr Yeo that CASE had sent Stansfield a similar letter seeking an
                    explanation of the discrepancy between the number of student passes issued and
                    the number of students protected by insurance policies. Mr Yeo then
                    informed Ms Lee of SIC’s unsuccessful attempts to access
                    Income’s online insurance application system and that Income had recently
                    returned two cheque payments for two batches of insurance applications. Upon
                    concluding the conversation, Mr Yeo had the impression that CASE was only
                    seeking clarification of the discrepancies that it had found. As the
                    14 November letter had only requested “clarification” and the
                    plaintiffs had been given till 23 November 2006 to respond, Mr Yeo
                    says he thought that the matter was “merely one of routine
                    clarification”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     At about 3pm on 20 November 2006, Mr Yeo
                    received a telephone call from Ms Majella who told him about Aegis’
                    e-mail of the same day. Shortly thereafter, Mr Chettiar himself called.
                    Mr Yeo confirmed that he had not received the Aegis e-mail himself and
                    informed Mr Chettiar of the 14 November letter to SIC and of the
                    problems the plaintiffs’ staff had encountered with logging on to the
                    online insurance application system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Later, Mr Yeo met with Mr Ang and
                    Dr Pious to discuss the developments and decide on what steps to take. He
                    then confirmed that Stansfield had also received the 14 November letter. At
                    about 3.45pm that afternoon, the three employees spoke to Mr Chettiar and
                    told him about the 14 November letters. Mr Chettiar instructed them to
                    prepare and provide a written response to CASE by the end of the same day,
                    notwithstanding that the letters had fixed 23 November 2006 as the
                    deadline. Mr Chettiar gave them various instructions as to what the
                    response should contain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     At about 4pm, Mr Yeo telephoned
                    Ms Lee again. He informed her of the e-mail from Aegis telling the
                    plaintiffs of the suspension by Income. Mr Yeo had called Ms Lee to
                    seek CASE’s assistance in getting Income to lift its suspension and he
                    therefore requested such assistance from her and explained that the plaintiffs
                    would rectify the discrepancies between the number of issued student passes and
                    the number of student insurance policies immediately after the suspension by
                    Income had been lifted. He emphasised that without the lifting of such
                    suspension, the plaintiffs would not be able to make good the discrepancies.
                    Ms Lee responded that CASE’s query and Income’s suspension were
                    two separate matters and that the plaintiffs had to deal directly with Income.
                    Mr Yeo informed Ms Lee that he would deliver the plaintiffs’
                    response to CASE by 6pm. During this conversation, Ms Lee did not at any
                    time mention the possibility of CASE suspending the schools’ membership of
                    CaseTrust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Later that evening, Mr Yeo made a third
                    telephone call to Ms Lee. His purpose was to ask for directions to
                    CASE’s office as well as to inform her that he would be a little late. By
                    the time he arrived at CASE’s office, the offices were locked and all
                    lights were turned off. There were no staff members around. He then telephoned
                    Ms Lee to let her know that he was outside the office and she met him at
                    the entrance. Mr Yeo handed the plaintiffs’ written response to her.
                    This was at about 6.15pm. Without opening the envelop or reading the response,
                    Ms Lee immediately handed two letters to Mr Yeo and requested him to
                    acknowledge receipt of the same. The letters were addressed to the schools and
                    when Mr Yeo opened them he discovered that they were Notices of Suspension
                    of CaseTrust membership. Mr Yeo left CASE’s office within five
                    minutes of arriving there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The letter that Mr Yeo handed to
                    Ms Lee was on the letterhead of the first plaintiff and was signed by
                    Dr Pious. It read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>DISCREPANCIES FOUND BETWEEN NUMBER OF ISSUED PASSES AND
                            NUMBER OF STUDENTS PROTECTED BY INSURANCE FROM APRIL 2006 TO SEPTEMBER
                            2006</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your letters dated 14 November 2006 sent to Stansfield College and the
                        Singapore Institute of Commerce refers, please. We received them on 18
                        November 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for highlighting the discrepancy. We apologise for the
                        oversight. It was due [<em>sic</em>] a mix of factors
                        – internal restructuring, staff turnover, new staff who were not
                        familiar with student pass procedures and the migration of the student
                        database to a new computer system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the ICA had approved the student passes, new staff did not follow up
                        with the insurance applications, as they assumed it had been already
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the migration of the database, several cases were identified in
                        October 2006 and attempts were made to submit their insurance applications
                        and make payment. However, the payment cheques were returned on 10 November
                        2006. More recently, further attempts were made to submit more applications
                        but staff were unable to access the system due to log-in failures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are treating this matter seriously and undertake to submit all
                        outstanding applications with [<em>sic</em>] the next
                        week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be noted that nowhere in this letter
                    did the first plaintiff contest CASE’s findings or its figures. There was
                    no challenge to the assertions that Stansfield had not insured 229 students and
                    SIC had not insured 250 students.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CASE’s version</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Ms Lee confirmed that at about 10am on 20
                    November 2006, Mr Yeo telephoned her regarding the 14 November letters. She
                    said that during the conversation, she informed Mr Yeo that CASE had only
                    just found out that Income had suspended the plaintiffs’ facilities under
                    the Scheme on 17 November 2006, and accordingly, the plaintiffs failed to
                    satisfy a fundamental and key criterion of CaseTrust for Education. Mr Yeo
                    confirmed to her that the plaintiffs’ insurance facilities had indeed been
                    suspended by Income. Ms Lee then informed Mr Yeo that unless Income
                    restored its facilities immediately, CASE would suspend the schools’
                    membership in CaseTrust by that same day. She then gave Mr Yeo an
                    opportunity to explain the plaintiffs’ position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Yeo told Ms Lee that the reason
                    for the discrepancy was that a number of the schools’ foreign students
                    were not protected by any insurance coverage. He explained that this was due to
                    an administrative oversight on the part of the plaintiffs, which was caused by
                    the plaintiffs’ staff turnover and internal restructuring. He also kept
                    apologising for the oversight. Mr Yeo also informed her that the schools
                    had attempted to submit a few applications for insurance coverage to Income on
                    10 November 2006, but these had been rejected. Ms Lee said that Income
                    had not made an issue of the rejection of applications and, in any event, this
                    did not change the fact that Income had decided to suspend the plaintiffs’
                    insurance facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Ms Lee informed Mr Yeo that his
                    explanation was not satisfactory to CASE as more than 400 of the schools’
                    students had not been covered by insurance for a period of six months and Income
                    had now suspended the plaintiffs’ insurance facilities. She also explained
                    that any suspension of the schools’ CaseTrust membership in the present
                    situation was not a sanction but only an interim measure to protect the
                    students’ interests and to enable the plaintiffs to remedy the deficiency
                    and restore their insurance facilities. She then told Mr Yeo that if the
                    plaintiffs wished to submit written submissions, they had to do so by 4pm that
                    day. Before ending the conversation, Ms Lee reminded Mr Yeo that
                    unless Income restored the plaintiffs’ student protection facilities, CASE
                    would suspend the schools’ memberships in CaseTrust by the end of that
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As Income had not restored the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance facilities at about 3pm on 20 November 2006,
                    the Notices of Suspension were prepared. The Notices of Suspension were signed
                    by Mr Pillay and he asked Ms Lee to hand them to Mr Yeo later
                    that day if by that time the plaintiffs’ insurance facilities still had
                    not been restored by Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     At about 4pm, Mr Yeo called Ms Lee
                    again. During their brief conversation, Mr Yeo said he would be late in
                    providing her with the plaintiffs’ written explanation. Ms Lee
                    informed him that the plaintiffs had until 6pm to provide the explanation as
                    CASE’s office would close at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     At about 6pm Mr Yeo arrived at
                    CASE’s office. He handed Ms Lee a copy of the plaintiffs’
                    letter of explanation. She asked him whether the contents of the letter were the
                    same as his explanation to her during the morning telephone conversation. He
                    confirmed that was so. Ms Lee informed Mr Yeo that since the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance facilities had not been restored by Income, CASE
                    would be suspending the plaintiffs’ membership. Mr Yeo said that he
                    understood and added that the plaintiffs would revert to CASE soon on how they
                    would remedy the situation. Ms Lee then handed Mr Yeo the Notices of
                    Suspension. She proceeded to read the plaintiffs’ letter in front of
                    Mr Yeo and found that the contents of the letter reflected the oral
                    explanation given to her earlier. As Mr Yeo had nothing further to add, he
                    left CASE’s office at about 6.15pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Notices of Suspension were in identical
                    terms. They read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after 20 November 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On 23 November 2006, the suspension of the
                    schools from CaseTrust for Education was published on CASE’s website. In
                    the meantime, the plaintiffs had been gathering detailed information on the
                    discrepancies and investigating what had caused the administrative lapse. By
                    24 November 2006, the plaintiffs had managed to identify the students who
                    had valid student passes but lacked the necessary insurance coverage. On
                    1 December 2006, the plaintiffs submitted a list of these students to
                    Ms Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     By way of two identical letters dated
                    28 November 2006, Stansfield and SIC formally responded to CASE’s
                    Notices of Suspension. These letters stated that CASE had not informed the PEOs
                    what “good business practice” they had breached and stated that if
                    the breach referred to the discrepancies found between the number of issued
                    student passes and the number of students protected by insurance from April to
                    November 2006, the schools had clarified and given an explanation on this in
                    their letters of 28 November 2006. The letters went on to state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be informed that we have already rectified any errors that you have
                        identified to us and as such it would be improper to suspend our membership.
                        We wish to also highlight that NTUC Income is not able to allow us to enter
                        the system to update the records as a result of the suspension of our
                        membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We wish to humbly point out that you have not given us reasonable notice
                        of suspension nor given us any proper or valid reasons in accordance with
                        the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On receipt of these letters, Ms Lee
                    contacted Mr Teo to find out whether Income had restored the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance facilities. She was told that it had not. CASE then
                    sent a letter to each of Stansfield and SIC which stated that there had been no
                    rectification and specified 4 December 2006 as the deadline for them to
                    make good their default. This letter also said that the schools’ CaseTrust
                    status had been suspended because there had been a breach of criterion C15 which
                    stated that the Scheme had to be in place for a PEO who recruited foreign
                    students. Further, the shortfall was a deemed breach of the standard student
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Income, in the meantime, was in the process of
                    evaluating whether to continue underwriting Stansfield and SIC under the Scheme.
                    On 5 December 2006, the plaintiffs’ audited accounts were submitted
                    to Income. The next day, Mr Teo informed Mr Chettiar that Income had
                    to be satisfied that the schools continued “to satisfy [its] underwriting
                    criteria upon which this facility was first made available” and that
                    Income would review its position and revert to Stansfield and SIC in due
                    course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     On 7 December 2006, the news of the
                    suspensions was reported on the front page of The Straits Times.
                    Mr Chettiar held an urgent meeting with his key management personnel and
                    subsequently drafted a letter entitled “Clarification” which was
                    to be distributed to all staff, students and other stakeholders. In this letter,
                    Mr Chettiar attempted to dispel any rumours regarding the plaintiffs’
                    solvency and emphasised that the plaintiffs were in a solid financial position.
                    Mr Chettiar sent an e-mail to the Ministry of Education and other
                    government authorities enclosing this letter because he wanted to quash any
                    rumours regarding the solvency of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On 10 December 2006, Mr Seah of CASE
                    telephoned Dr Pious and Mr Teo and proposed a meeting at CASE’s
                    office to resolve the outstanding issues between the parties so that Income
                    would restore the schools’ insurance facilities and cover the 479 students
                    who were uninsured. This meeting was held on 12 December 2006 and was
                    attended by representatives from CASE (Mr Seah, Ms Lee and one
                    Mr Loi), Income (Mr Teo), Aegis (Mr Tay) and the plaintiffs
                    (Dr Pious, Mr Yeo, Mr Ang and one Andrew Koo). At the meeting,
                    the plaintiffs agreed to make immediate payment of premiums to Income, and in
                    return, Income agreed to restore the plaintiffs’ insurance facilities
                    under the Scheme, insure the plaintiffs’ students who were not protected
                    by insurance and train the plaintiffs’ staff on the online application
                    procedures. Income had by this time received a report from Dunn &amp; Bradstreet
                    which stated that it found the plaintiffs’ financial condition as shown in
                    the accounts to be “fair” and their credit risk to be
                    “average”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Income lifted the suspension of the Scheme
                    insurance facilities granted to the plaintiffs shortly after the meeting. The
                    plaintiffs’ Maximum Insurable Limits were, however, reduced from $6m to an
                    aggregate of $4m. Insurance cover for the uninsured students was issued with
                    retrospective effect on 13 December 2006. On the same day, CASE lifted its
                    suspension of the schools’ membership in CaseTrust for Education. CASE
                    notified the plaintiffs of this action by fax and by post and also removed the
                    names of both Stansfield and SIC from the list of suspended schools on
                    CASE’s website.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Adverse consequences of the suspension</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The plaintiffs allege that they suffered
                    adverse consequences by reason of the suspension of their membership in
                    CaseTrust and the unavailability of the insurance facilities. They
                    particularised these adverse consequences in their statement of claim. At this
                    stage, it is only necessary for me to give a summary of the allegations. These
                    are that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     between in or about November 2006
                        and February 2007, several students who had enrolled in courses with the
                        schools had applied to withdraw from their respective courses and had
                        requested that the tuition fees that they had paid to the plaintiffs be
                        refunded; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiffs suffered a loss of commercial reputation and goodwill in
                        Singapore and internationally due to the adverse publicity in relation to
                        CASE’s suspension of the plaintiffs from their CaseTrust
                        membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In respect of sub-para (a) above, the
                    plaintiffs seek to recover the refunded tuition fees and in respect of
                    sub-para (b) above, the plaintiffs ask for damages to be assessed in
                    respect of the loss of commercial reputation and goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ claim against CASE</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The plaintiffs set up their claim against CASE
                    in two ways. The first way relates to the breach of contractual duties that CASE
                    allegedly owed the plaintiffs directly. In relation to this cause of action, in
                    the statement of claim the plaintiffs aver that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is a necessary implied term of
                        the CASE-PEO agreement and the Code of Practice that CASE would, <em>inter alia</em>, comply strictly with the terms of the
                        CASE-PEO agreement and the Code of Practice when exercising its jurisdiction
                        and powers to make decisions affecting the rights and interests of PEOs and
                        would not exercise any powers over the plaintiffs which were in excess of
                        CASE’s powers and jurisdiction (para 10.1). The suspension of the
                        CaseTrust membership breached the implied term pleaded at para 10.1 in
                        that it was <em>ultra vires</em> CASE’s rights
                        and powers under the CASE-PEO agreement and the Code of Practice. These
                        documents do not provide CASE with the power to suspend the
                        plaintiffs’ CaseTrust membership making the suspension unlawful and
                        void.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further
                        or alternatively (para 13), the suspension was in breach of
                        cl 10.1 and/or cl 10.2 of the Code of Practice because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_72-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       CASE failed to give either
                            of the schools an opportunity to answer the allegation;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_72-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       CASE
                            failed to carry out any independent investigation into the schools
                            alleged breaches of the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is an implied term of the CASE-PEO agreement
                        and the Code of Practice that (para 10.2) CASE would exercise its
                        powers pursuant to the CASE-PEO agreement and/or the Code of Practice in a
                        reasonable manner, and (para 10.3) CASE would not act in an arbitrary
                        or capricious manner in its dealing with its members including the
                        plaintiffs. CASE breached the foregoing implied terms because the suspension
                        was unreasonable in the circumstances of the case or was arbitrary or was
                        capricious (para 14).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_d"></a>(d)     It is implied term of the CASE-PEO agreement and the Code
                        of Practice that (para 10.4) CASE would give the plaintiffs notice of
                        any charge preferred against them before calling upon them to answer the
                        same and (para 10.5) CASE would comply with accepted principles of
                        natural justice and would afford to the plaintiffs the right of a reasonable
                        opportunity to be heard in connection with any independent investigation to
                        be conducted by CASE before imposing any sanction for alleged breaches of
                        the Code of Practice or the CASE-PEO agreement. CASE breached these terms by
                        failing to give the plaintiffs notice of any charge preferred or to be
                        preferred against them before calling upon them to answer the same in
                        connection with its investigation. Further, CASE failed to accord to the
                        plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to be heard in connection with its
                        investigation before imposing sanctions on the plaintiffs for alleged
                        breaches of the CASE-PEO agreement and/or the Code of
                    Practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The second basis of claim against CASE is in
                    tort. The plaintiffs have the following causes of action:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     They plead that the conduct of CASE
                        in sending the e-mail dated 20 October 2006 to Income which stated that the
                        plaintiffs “may be closing down soon” wrongfully and
                        recklessly induced and procured the breach by Income of its obligations to
                        the plaintiffs (paras 16 to 18).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     They plead that the 20 October 2006 e-mail unlawfully
                        interfered with the contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and
                        Income and/or hindered the performance by Income of its obligations to the
                        plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, they plead that CASE owed them a duty to not act in any manner
                        that would adversely affect the contractual relationship between them and
                        Income and further, to administer the CaseTrust membership scheme in such a
                        manner so as not to cause loss or damage to the plaintiffs (para 20).
                        CASE negligently or in breach of these duties communicated the e-mail of
                        20 October 2006 to Income without any reasonable basis, failed to
                        sufficiently investigate the matters set out in that e-mail and failed to
                        afford the plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to deal with its concerns
                        with respect to the plaintiffs’ CaseTrust membership. In this regard,
                        CASE acted arbitrary or capriciously in issuing the Notices of Suspension on
                        20 November 2006 and CASE acted in an unreasonable manner in all the
                        circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    highlighted six main issues relating to their claim against CASE. They
                    formulated these issues as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether CASE breached cl 10.1
                        of the Code of Practice in failing to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity
                        to be heard prior to suspending the plaintiffs’ CaseTrust for
                        Education membership;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether CASE breached cl 10.2 of the Code of Practice in failing
                        to carry out an independent investigation into the plaintiffs’ alleged
                        breaches of the Code of Practice;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether CASE breached the pleaded implied terms of the
                        CASE-PEO agreements and the Code of Practice;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether CASE wrongfully and recklessly induced
                        and procured the breach by Income of its obligations to the
                        plaintiffs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether CASE unlawfully interfered with the contractual relationship
                        between the plaintiffs and Income and/or hindered the performance by Income
                        of its obligations to the plaintiffs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_f"></a>(f)     Whether CASE breached its duty of care to the
                        plaintiffs not to act in any manner that would adversely affect the
                        contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and Income and to administer
                        the CaseTrust membership scheme in such a manner so as not to cause loss or
                        damage to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I should note at this stage that at all
                    material times, CASE’s contractual relationship was with the first
                    plaintiff since the second plaintiff did not acquire its interest in SIC until
                    January 2007. Since the plaintiffs themselves did not draw this distinction in
                    their submissions, I will refer to the plaintiffs collectively in relation to
                    liability. If liability is established, however, it must be remembered that such
                    liability would be <em>prima facie</em> to the first
                    plaintiff only and I would then have to consider whether the second plaintiff is
                    in a position to recover damages because of its subsequent takeover of SIC.
                    Also, strictly speaking, it was the schools as distinct businesses of the first
                    plaintiff that were members of CaseTrust for Education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As CASE pointed out in its own closing
                    submissions, it is apparent from the way in which the plaintiffs’ list of
                    issues has been formulated that they have abandoned the pleaded contention that
                    the suspension of the schools was <em>ultra
                    vires</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First category of issues: was CASE in breach of the Code of Practice
                or the CASE-PEO agreements?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The issues set out in [74(a) to (c)] above can
                    be considered together because they deal with the legal implications of the Code
                    of Practice and the CASE-PEO agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The provisions of cl 10.1 and 10.2 of the
                    Code of Practice are set out in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above.
                    The heading above both provisions is “Sanctions for breach of this
                    Code”. To paraphrase the provisions, cl 10.1 provides that when
                    CaseTrust becomes aware that a breach of the Code or of the terms and conditions
                    of membership has taken place, it will provide an opportunity for the member to
                    answer the allegations. Under cl 10.2, if CaseTrust concludes after an
                    independent investigation that a breach of the Code has occurred, it may impose
                    appropriate penalties including warnings, fines and expulsion or a combination
                    of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     CASE has denied that it was in breach of
                    cl 10 or the CASE-PEO agreement. It says the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_a"></a>(a)     cl 10 is not applicable because the
                        suspensions were not a sanction or a penalty;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_b"></a>(b)     cl 10 is not applicable as Stansfield and SIC
                        were in breach of the CASE-PEO agreement and not the Code of
                        Practice;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        CASE-PEO agreement is qualified by an implied term that CASE may suspend
                        members without an opportunity to be heard as an interim measure or due to
                        extenuating circumstances; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_79-p2_d"></a>(d)     in any event, CASE did not breach cl 10 as it gave
                        Stansfield and SIC an opportunity to be heard and carried out an independent
                        investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Before I go on to discuss the issues in more
                    detail, I deal with a brief submission made by CASE that the Code of Practice is
                    not even applicable in the present case. The only basis that CASE gave for that
                    submission was it thought that if the Code of Practice is considered in the
                    context of the overall CaseTrust framework and if one takes into account the
                    other contractual documents governing the contractual relationship between CASE,
                    the plaintiffs and their students, as well as the unique characteristics of
                    CaseTrust for Education and the Scheme, it would become apparent that the Code
                    of Practice did not apply to the present situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It appears that this argument is based on the
                    fact that the Code of Practice is a generic code which applies generally to CASE
                    members across all industries and that the practices governed by the Code
                    include practices in relation to advertising and promotion, customer service,
                    electronic commerce, privacy and marketing by telephone and through other media.
                    The Code was drafted before the CaseTrust for Education scheme was developed
                    and, according to cl 1.1, it sets out good business practices to be used by
                    members and provides a framework for resolving disputes between the member and a
                    consumer or between members <em>inter se</em>. The spirit
                    of the Code is also to ensure that all transactions arising out of a
                    member’s business will be conducted with honesty, integrity and
                    transparency. CASE seems to be implying in this submission that the Code is
                    aimed more at businesses which involve commercial transactions than at the more
                    specialised private education sector which requires a different regulatory
                    framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I cannot accept this argument. It is correct
                    that major portions of the Code of Practice are aimed at commerce in its more
                    common form and that some of its clauses are not a good fit for entities
                    providing private education. This is why when the CaseTrust for Education scheme
                    was initiated it had to be supplemented by CASE-PEO agreements, the Info-Kit and
                    the prescribed form of contract with the student. That conclusion does not,
                    however, mean that all portions of the Code cannot be applied to PEOs. Whether a
                    particular clause of the Code applies to a PEO would depend on what that clause
                    prescribes and what the business of the PEO is. It is relevant that para 47
                    of the Info-Kit which appears as part of the section 7.4 which has the general
                    heading “CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme” reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to uphold the standards, which may be updated from time to time,
                        set by CaseTrust, all members shall adhere to the Code of Practice and abide
                        by penalties imposed upon breach/ infringement of the Code of
                        Practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, aspiring applicants to membership of
                    CaseTrust were informed from the outset that if membership was granted, they
                    would be expected to adhere to the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Further, as the plaintiffs point out,
                    para 1.3 of section 1 of the Code of Practice is very clear. It
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This code is intended to provide the general principles to be followed by
                        members when conducting their business and supplements the various
                        agreements, which the members have entered into with CASE (including but not
                        limited to the terms and conditions for membership).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was envisaged therefore that membership
                    would be regulated not only by the Code but by other terms and conditions
                    tailor-made for the particular industry involved. In this case, those terms and
                    conditions are found in the Info-Kit and the CASE-PEO agreement. It is plain to
                    me that the Code of Practice was intended to apply to all members of CaseTrust
                    and that, in the absence of specific provision to that effect, PEOs who are
                    members of CaseTrust for Education are not exempted from the provisions of the
                    Code insofar as the same are pertinent to the business of private education and
                    the status of being a CaseTrust member. It is also relevant in this connection
                    that cl 10.1 is invoked not only when there is a breach of the Code but
                    also when there is a breach of any other term or condition of membership.
                        <em>Prima facie</em> therefore, the applicability of
                    the Code as a relevant document cannot be gainsaid. Whether any particular
                    clause of it applies in any particular situation is, however, a different
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the suspensions a sanction or penalty?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiffs rely on cll 10.1 and 10.2 of
                    the Code of Practice to support their position that Stansfield and SIC could not
                    be suspended because there was no independent investigation and they were not
                    given a chance to answer the allegations. The position taken by CASE is that
                    cl 10 only applies when a sanction is contemplated or invoked and did not
                    apply in this instance because the suspension of Stansfield’s and
                    SIC’s membership in CaseTrust for Education in November/December 2006 was
                    not a sanction or a penalty within the meaning of the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     CASE argues that cl 10 expressly states
                    that members will be given an opportunity to answer the allegations prior to the
                    imposition of certain “sanctions” and “penalties” by
                    CASE. The clause is entitled “SANCTIONS FOR BREACH OF THIS CODE”
                    and cl 10.2 refers to the types of “penalties” that may be
                    imposed by CASE. Therefore, it only applies when penalties are imposed. The
                    natural and ordinary meaning of the words “penalty” and
                    “sanction” is that of a punishment imposed for a violation of
                    certain rules and obligations. Those words do not apply in a case like this
                    where the suspensions were not penalties intended to punish the schools but
                    instead were imposed as an interim and precautionary measure intended to
                    safeguard the reinstatement of Stansfield’s and SIC’s facilities
                    under the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The plaintiffs disagree. They submit that the
                    suspension of the schools’ membership of CaseTrust for Education was
                    clearly a sanction or penalty. The terms “sanction” and
                    “penalty” are not defined in the Code of Practice but should be
                    understood in their “plain, ordinary and popular sense” (see
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, Sweet and Maxwell,
                        30<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008 para 12-051) because that is
                    the starting point in construing a contract, as <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> states in the cited paragraph. They say that a
                    suspension of membership would generally be understood as a sanction or penalty.
                    Moreover, under cl 10.1 CaseTrust may impose “such penalties as may
                    be specified or as may be appropriate in the circumstances, including but not
                    limited to warnings, fines and/or expulsion”. Thus, the penalties that
                    are named in the clause are illustrative and not exhaustive. The penalties
                    mentioned range from a low degree of severity to a high one and, on that scale,
                    a suspension would fall in between a fine and an expulsion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The plaintiffs also say that CASE’s
                    subjective intentions in issuing the Notices of Suspension are irrelevant in
                    construing the terms “sanction” and “penalty”. In
                    any event, the suspensions operated as such because they withdrew all the rights
                    and privileges that the schools had as CaseTrust members. The Notices told the
                    schools to stop using the CaseTrust logo and to remove the CaseTrust decal from
                    their premises. The Notices also left the status of the memberships in limbo
                    because they stated that “[t]he CaseTrust Secretariat shall review and
                    keep you updated on the status of your membership within fourteen (14) days of
                    this letter”. The suspensions were published on CaseTrust’s website
                    and a result, ICA rejected applications made for student visas for the
                    schools’ students. The effect of the suspensions was
                punitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The parties cited two cases which dealt with
                    the nature of a suspension. In one case, the one relied on by the plaintiffs, a
                    suspension was held to be equivalent to an expulsion, whilst in the other, a
                    suspension was not considered to be punitive. The first case, <em>John v Rees</em> [1970] 1 Ch 345 (“<em>Rees</em>”), was a decision of Megarry J in the High Court of
                    England. The case involved the authority of the National Executive Committee of
                    the Labour Party to pass a resolution to suspend the activities of the
                    Pembrokeshire Divisional Labour Party. In holding that such a resolution was a
                    nullity, Megarry J quoted the case of <em>Burn v National
                        Amalgamated Labourers’ Union</em> [1920] 2 Ch 364
                        (“<em>Burn</em>”) where P O Lawrence J in
                    construing a trade union rule which authorised the union to “suspend,
                    expel and prosecute” members held that the language of the rule did not
                    authorise a resolution removing the plaintiff from any office held by him and
                    preventing him from holding any delegation on behalf of the union for five
                    years. Megarry J commented (at 397):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[P O Lawrence J] went on to consider the position if he were wrong in thus
                        construing the rules, and said at p. 374,: “I have no hesitation in
                        holding the power to suspend or expel a member for acting contrary to the
                        rules is one of a quasi-judicial nature”; and he accordingly held the
                        resolution bad because the plaintiff had not been given an opportunity of
                        being heard in his defence. In relation to the rules of natural justice
                        Lawrence J. thus made no distinction between suspension and expulsion. I
                        would respectfully concur: in essence, suspension is merely expulsion pro
                        tanto. Each is penal, and each deprives the member concerned of the
                        enjoyment of his rights of membership or office. Accordingly, in my judgment
                        the rules of mutual justice prima facie apply to any such process of
                        suspension in the same way that they apply to expulsion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be seen from the foregoing that
                    Megarry J considered suspension to be as penal as expulsion and to deprive the
                    person suspended from membership of the enjoyment of his rights of
                    membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A different approach was taken by the majority
                    in the Privy Council decision of <em>Paul Wallis Furnell v
                        Whangarei High Schools Board</em> [1973] 1 AC 660 (“<em>Furnell</em>”), an appeal from New Zealand which was
                    decided some three years after <em>Rees</em>. In that case,
                    a teacher was suspended by the school board from duty as he was charged with
                    certain disciplinary offences. The teacher then instituted legal proceedings
                    against the school board on the ground that there had been a denial of natural
                    justice and that he had not been told that his conduct was being investigated
                    and had not been given an opportunity to be heard. A suspension was not included
                    as one of the penalties prescribed under the relevant regulations. The Privy
                    Council upheld the New Zealand Court of Appeal’s decision that the school
                    board did not violate any rules of natural justice and that it was not unfair to
                    suspend the teacher without giving him a right to be heard. The following
                    passage from the judgment of Lord Morris who delivered the majority decision is
                    pertinent (at 682F to 683B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is next necessary to consider whether there was any unfairness on the
                        part of the board, as was strongly suggested in the submissions made on
                        behalf of the appellant. Though the board followed faithfully the directions
                        of the regulations <em>it is said that nevertheless they
                            should give a teacher an opportunity of being heard before they decide
                            to suspend. Neither in the regulations nor in the Act is suspension
                            classified as a penalty. Section 157(3) shows that it is not</em>.
                        It must however be recognised that suspension may involve hardship. During
                        suspension salary is not paid and apart from this something of a temporary
                        slur may be involved if a teacher is suspended. But the regulations (by
                        regulation 5) clearly contemplate or lay it down that the written statement
                        of a teacher (under regulation 5(2) and the oral personal statement of a
                        regulation 5(3)) will be made after suspension if any has taken place.
                        Suspension is discretionary. <em>Decisions as to whether to
                            suspend will often be difficult. Members of a board who are appointed or
                            elected to act as the governing body of a school must in the exercise of
                            their responsibilities have regard not only to the interests of teachers
                            but to the interests of pupils and of parents and of the public. There
                            may be occasions when having regard to the nature of a charge it will be
                            wise, in the interests of all concerned, that pending decision whether
                            the charge is substantiated a teacher should be suspended from
                            duty</em>. In many cases it can be assumed that charges would be
                        denied and that only after a full hearing could the true position be
                        ascertained. It is not to be assumed that a board, constituted as it is,
                        will wantonly exercise its discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     There is therefore case authority to support
                    the proposition that whether the act of suspending a person from a position or a
                    membership is penal or not depends on the circumstances of the case. Among these
                    circumstances is whether the regulations involved expressly classify suspension
                    as a penalty or not and what the purpose of the suspension is. It may also be a
                    matter of significance as to whether the suspending authority is charged with
                    protecting the interests of third parties. This seems to be a significant
                    difference between the cases of <em>Burn</em> and <em>Rees</em> on the one hand and <em>Furnell</em> on the other. In the first two cases, the union was
                    considering its own interests and the conduct of the member concerned when it
                    decided to suspend him from membership. In <em>Furnell</em>, the school board was investigating a complaint and thus
                    considering the conduct of Mr Furnell but it also had to consider the
                    interests of pupils and their parents and of the public and how these should be
                    protected whilst the investigations were taking their course. The existence of
                    such third party interests was a vital factor in persuading the Privy Council
                    that suspension was invoked as a protective measure rather than a penal one. As
                    important would be the purpose of the suspension <em>ie</em> whether it is considered an end in itself or is intended to
                    provide a period in which something else can be accomplished, in the <em>Furnell</em> case that something else being the full
                    investigation into the charges which could have resulted either in the complete
                    exoneration and reinstatement of Mr Furnell or in his being subjected to a
                    punishment. There is no indication from either <em>Burn</em> or <em>Rees</em> that in those cases
                    it was intended that certain action be taken during the period of suspension
                    which might result in either the lifting of the suspension or in the application
                    of another sanction. In fact in <em>Rees</em> itself, the
                    court emphasised that the practical result of the suspension there was
                    indistinguishable from expulsion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Coming to the present case, I must therefore
                    examine the circumstances more closely in order to determine whether or not the
                    suspension was a penalty and therefore could not be imposed under cl 10
                    unless the schools had been given the opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The first point here relates to the purpose of
                    the suspension. Was it intended to punish the schools because they had not
                    provided insurance cover the foreign students? In considering the intention, I
                    think it is irrelevant that the schools may have experienced hardship after the
                    suspensions in that their applications for student visas were not accepted by
                    ICA or that some students may have withdrawn. Those are painful consequences
                    but, as <em>Furnell</em> recognised, hardship arising from
                    a suspension does not turn that action into a punishment. It is also relevant
                    that CASE gave evidence that it suspended the schools’ membership in
                    CaseTrust and published the suspensions on its website precisely so that the ICA
                    would not approve student visa applications or issue student passes because
                    these new students would not be able to get protection under the Scheme since
                    Income had suspended the insurance facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     CASE’s position is that the suspension
                    was an interim measure implemented on an urgent basis to address a specific
                    problem in relation to the Scheme. Mr Pillay and Ms Lee testified that
                    CASE only decided to suspend Stansfield and SIC after learning on
                    17 November 2006 that Income had suspended the insurance facilities. It
                    says that the fact that the suspensions were implemented shortly after CASE
                    discovered that the insurance facilities had been suspended shows that CASE was
                    simply responding to the situation. It used the suspensions as a mechanism to
                    immediately prevent more students from being issued passes without any valid
                    insurance coverage and to provide a space within which the plaintiffs could sort
                    out the matter of compliance with the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The plaintiffs make the point that CASE did
                    not act on an urgent basis because it knew from 20 October 2006 that the
                    insurance facilities had been suspended. On that day, Mr Teo had informed
                    Ms Lee that Income was suspending with immediate effect its “bond
                    facility to SIC and its affiliated schools till further notice from you”.
                    The plaintiffs say that Ms Lee must have known that the phrase “bond
                    facility” referred to the insurance facilities extended by Income. They
                    think that Ms Lee’s evidence that she did not understand this phrase
                    and that it “sounded more like maybe a personal loan between the school
                    and the insurer” is suspect and very likely, an afterthought. The
                    plaintiffs emphasise that Mr Teo had informed CASE that the suspension was
                    until further notice from CASE. Logically, there would be no need for Income to
                    wait for further notice from CASE to reinstate their personal loans to the
                    plaintiffs unless the facilities affected CASE’s relationship with the
                    plaintiffs in some way which was the case in relation to the insurance
                    facilities. Further, in the course of the evidence, Mr Teo and other
                    witnesses for Income had confirmed that it was plain that by using the term
                    “bond facility”, Income was referring to insurance
                    policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Having considered the evidence, I think it is
                    probable that Ms Lee truly did not understand that the phrase “bond
                    facility” referred to the insurance facilities. Unlike the persons who
                    gave evidence for Income, she is not in the insurance business and would not be
                    familiar with the way that phrase is used in the insurance industry. She herself
                    said that the phrase was “truly alien” to her. Lay people
                    generally connect bonds with loans rather than with insurance or performance
                    guarantees. The phrase “bond facility” is not a common one and it
                    appears only once in the correspondence produced in the course of these events.
                    Mr Teo agreed that the more precise phrase for the insurance facilities
                    extended to the schools would be “SPS facility”. In fact, that
                    latter phrase was the one that Mr Teo used on 17 November 2006 when he
                    instructed Mr Tay to inform the plaintiffs of the suspension of the
                    insurance facilities. Further, even Mr Pillay who is legally trained, did
                    not think that the bond facility meant a personal loan between Income and the
                    schools. When he was asked about it in court, he said that he understood it to
                    mean a bond or charge granted to NTUC Income over certain of the schools’
                    assets. Mr Pillay was not shown the email of 20 October 2006 at that
                    time and therefore did not see how the phrase was used in the email. He had
                    nothing to do with the way that Ms Lee interpreted the phrase and thus,
                    even if he should have understood it to refer to the insurance facilities, that
                    understanding would not have altered the course of events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In any event, I accept CASE’s submission
                    that Ms Lee would not have interpreted “bond facility” as
                    being the insurance facilities because it was inconceivable to her that Income
                    would suspend these facilities due to her e-mail of 20 October 2006. In
                    that email, she had told Income about the rumours about the schools but had
                    stressed that CASE needed more “concrete evidence” to substantiate
                    the truth of the same. Whilst telling him that CASE and other governing agencies
                    were highly concerned and that they needed to be prepared for the worst, she
                    also said that she looked forward to receiving information and comments from
                    Income. Thus, this was a letter informing a fellow stakeholder in the Scheme of
                    a potentially difficult situation and asking for further information. There was
                    nothing in that email to indicate any action being taken by CASE at that stage.
                    As the consumer watchdog interested in the welfare of the students, CASE wanted
                    more information but did not want to act precipitately without concrete evidence
                    and would not have wanted Income to suspend the insurance facilities of a
                    CaseTrust member as it would adversely affect new students who enrolled in such
                    member school as well as prevent existing students without any insurance
                    coverage from applying for such coverage under the Scheme. Ms Lee did not
                    ask Income to take any action; what CASE wanted from Income was information to
                    assist in its investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Thus, I accept that Ms Lee was not
                    expecting anything to be done by Income in relation to the insurance facilities
                    and therefore Mr Teo’s reference in his email to the suspension of
                    the “bond facility” would not have made a strong impression on her
                    when she read it. In hindsight, one could say that she should have wondered why
                    he was telling her about this action and should have found out more about it but
                    since this phrase was not in common use in connection with the Scheme and her
                    attention was focused on other matters relating to the investigation, it is not
                    really surprising that she did not react in any way to it. In fact, her failure
                    to inform Mr Pillay or anyone else about this information from Income is
                    another indication that she did not appreciate its significance. When she was
                    told late on the evening of 17 November 2006 that Income was going to
                    suspend its “SPS facility” to the schools with immediate effect,
                    she went straight to Mr Pillay with the news not withstanding that the
                    office was closing for the weekend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Going back to the purpose of the suspensions,
                    the evidence of Mr Pillay was that the suspensions were not a sanction but
                    were taken as a temporary action so that the plaintiffs would be able to rectify
                    the situation. He explained that a suspension could be withdrawn at any time,
                    even the day after it was made. On the other hand, if the membership had been
                    revoked it could not have been restored without a fresh application for
                    membership which would have taken about three months to process. Ms Lee had
                    the same view and explained the suspensions were intended to “contain the
                    situation”. On the other hand, Mr Seah testified during cross
                    examination the suspensions were a sanction although not a penalty. In
                    re-examination, however, he corrected himself and explained that the suspensions
                    were to contain a situation that had occurred and were not meant to be a
                    sanction or punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In this connection, I think it is material
                    that there was no specified period of suspension and it was clear from the
                    Notices that CASE was going to review the situation within a short period.
                    Mr Seah testified that the schools were not suspended for any longer than
                    necessary to ensure that the students’ interests were safeguarded.
                    Ms Lee’s evidence was that CASE’s intention was to immediately
                    lift the suspensions once the schools had been able to remedy the situation
                    either by restoring the insurance facilities or by entering into an escrow
                    arrangement. In the event, that intention was fulfilled and as soon as the
                    insurance facilities were reinstated, the suspensions of membership were lifted.
                    The fact that the suspensions were temporary, were not for any fixed period and
                    ended immediately after the <em>status quo ante</em> had
                    been restored, is a very strong indication that the suspensions were not
                    sanctions or penalties but were imposed for a totally different
                purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The next point that has to be considered is
                    the role that CASE was playing when it decided to suspend the schools from
                    membership in CaseTrust. The evidence makes it plain that in administering
                    CaseTrust for Education, CASE does not act as a regulator of private schools
                        <em>per se</em>. It has no licensing function nor can
                    it prescribe what courses can be offered or how they should be presented. It
                    does not regulate the activity of these schools at all except insofar as they
                    wish to recruit foreign students and even in respect of such foreign students,
                    CASE’s only role is to ensure that the fees paid by these students will be
                    protected if certain events take place before completion of the students’
                    courses. It acts as a consumer protection agency albeit for a very circumscribed
                    group of consumers and in a very narrow compass, and it has to bear the
                    interests of these consumers in mind in relation to every action it takes. I
                    think it bears repeating that CASE’s role is to protect students rather
                    than to control PEOs. This protective role is achieved by monitoring the
                    PEOs’ compliance with the Scheme and by ICA refusing to issue student
                    passes for persons enrolled in PEOs that are not members of CaseTrust for
                    Education. As long as a PEO is a member of CaseTrust for Education, ICA does not
                    go behind that designation. It is therefore up to CASE to protect students by
                    ensuring that CaseTrust members have an escrow arrangement or insurance
                    facilities in place. In this context, CASE’s actions in suspending the
                    schools can be understood as being protective of the students rather than
                    punitive of the schools. CASE’s witnesses were at pains to emphasise the
                    protective nature of CASE’s role as being the reason for the decision to
                    suspend and I accept their evidence in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
                    that the suspensions were not, and were not intended as, penalties or sanctions.
                    Their purpose was to safeguard students and the aim of CaseTrust for Education.
                    They were temporary in nature and removed as soon as the necessity for their
                    existence was itself removed. Although the schools may have experienced hardship
                    as a result of the suspensions, this did not turn them into
                penalties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the plaintiffs have an opportunity to be heard?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Since I have held that the suspensions were
                    not penalties, they did not fall under cl 10 of the Code of Practice and
                    therefore, strictly speaking, I do not have to consider whether or not the
                    plaintiffs were given an opportunity to be heard as required by cl 10.2.
                    However, I will consider this issue briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    CASE argues that it is clear from the
                    contemporaneous documents and the evidence led at trial that the schools were
                    given sufficient opportunity to be heard. They had the opportunity to make oral
                    representations during the telephone call between Ms Lee and Mr Yeo
                    and were invited to submit written representations. They did in fact submit
                    their written representations later that day. Both the oral and written
                    representations were considered by CASE, which determined that the explanation
                    given was not satisfactory. In these circumstances, there is no basis for the
                    plaintiffs to allege that such an opportunity was not given to
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The plaintiffs say that the matters referred
                    to by CASE did not amount to a sufficient opportunity for them to be heard as
                    required by cl 10. They say that during the first conversation between
                    Mr Yeo and Ms Lee on 20 October 2006 which took place at about
                    10am that morning, there was no mention by Ms Lee of the suspension by
                    Income or of the possibility of the suspension by CASE or that CASE required the
                    plaintiffs to respond to the 14 November letters by 4pm that day. During the
                    second telephone conversation at about 4pm that afternoon, Mr Yeo did not
                    receive a positive response to his request that CASE assist the plaintiffs in
                    obtaining the lifting of Income’s suspension. The third conversation was a
                    short one relating to Mr Yeo’s late arrival and the fourth
                    conversation took no more than two minutes when the exchange of letters outside
                    CASE’s office was effected. In these circumstances, the plaintiffs had no
                    notice of CASE’s intention to suspend them and no real opportunity to be
                    heard on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The first sub-issue is whether I should
                    accept Ms Lee’s account of her interactions with Mr Yeo on
                    20 November 2006 or Mr Yeo’s account of the same. If
                    Mr Yeo’s version is to be believed, he had no knowledge during the
                    first conversation of Income’s suspension and no knowledge at any time
                    until he opened CASE’s letters at 6pm that CASE was intending to suspend
                    the schools’ memberships. If that version is accepted, the plaintiffs
                    clearly were not given an opportunity to be heard on the intended action under
                    cl 10. Ms Lee on the other hand was adamant that in the morning
                    itself, Mr Yeo was aware of Income’s action and that she told him of
                    CASE’s intentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I find it difficult to accept
                    Mr Yeo’s evidence on this point. The 14 November letters gave
                    the schools up to 23 November to respond and, according to Mr Yeo, he
                    did not even know about these letters until the morning of 20 November
                    itself. At the same time, he was unaware of CASE’s intention to suspend
                    the schools’ membership that day if nothing was done about restoring the
                    insurance facilities. Yet, he rushed down to CASE’s office by 6pm that
                    evening so that he could hand Ms Lee a letter from the first plaintiff
                    explaining the schools’ failure to insure their students. By his own
                    evidence, he even called Ms Lee at 4pm to inform her that he would deliver
                    the letter that evening. If he had truly been unaware that CASE was on the verge
                    of suspending the schools, he would have been under the impression that the
                    written explanation was due only 23 November 2006 and there would have been
                    no reason for him to rush to CASE’s office on an urgent basis and
                    personally deliver the letter to CASE. It seems to me that his actions were
                    consistent with the fact that Ms Lee had told him during their telephone
                    conversations on 20 November 2006 that CASE was intending to suspend the
                    schools that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Secondly, Mr Yeo did not protest when
                    the Notices of Suspension were handed to him by Ms Lee that evening. This
                    indicates that he was not taken by surprise or shocked by the suspension. This
                    must be because he had already been informed that CASE would suspend the schools
                    if the insurance facilities were not restored by that evening. If he had not
                    known about CASE’s intention prior to the meeting at 6pm, it is likely he
                    would not have accepted the Notices of Suspension so calmly. In fact, it was not
                    till more than a week later that the schools wrote to assert that CASE had not
                    given them “reasonable notice of suspension” and even then there
                    was no allegation that no notice at all of suspension had been provided prior to
                    the handover of the official Notices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Thirdly, Mr Yeo had claimed that on 20
                    November 2006 he did not tell Ms Lee the reasons for the schools’
                    failure to insure their students. This claim seems odd because there was
                    evidence (supported by an almost contemporaneous memorandum) that on that same
                    day, he had telephoned Mr Tay and told Mr Tay of the reasons for the
                    schools’ failure to insure. Given that he explained this to Mr Tay,
                    the likelihood is that he also gave a similar explanation to Ms Lee that
                    day, especially since CASE had asked in writing for an explanation of the
                    discrepancies. Mr Yeo’s version was that he merely called Ms Lee
                    to “seek further clarification” regarding the 14 November
                    letters. However, he admitted that he was “shocked” to receive
                    those letters and it is therefore hard to believe that he would not give some
                    sort of explanation to Ms Lee at the first opportunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Apart from the difficulties with
                    Mr Yeo’s evidence, there is the evidence of both Ms Lee and
                    Mr Pillay that she had told him of Mr Yeo’s explanation and they
                    had discussed whether the same was satisfactory and should affect the decision
                    to suspend the schools. I find no reason to disbelieve this evidence. The
                    decision to suspend the schools was a serious one which was discussed throughout
                    the day as Ms Lee kept checking the position regarding the insurance
                    facilities and I accept that any explanation of the failure to insure would have
                    been talked about at length and therefore remembered clearly. Overall, I prefer
                    Ms Lee’s accounts of her conversations with Mr Yeo to
                    his.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Notwithstanding the foregoing finding, I
                    think that if cl 10 had applied to the situation or if, for any other
                    reason the plaintiffs were entitled to an opportunity to be heard, CASE would
                    not have provided the plaintiffs with an adequate opportunity to be heard. If a
                    punishment is to be imposed, the party to be punished has to be told of the
                    charge or allegation against him and given an opportunity either to answer the
                    same in full so as to be exonerated or to give an explanation which would
                    mitigate the severity of the penalty to be levied. This generally would mean a
                    written notification which also specified a reasonable period for response. In
                    this case, there was no written notification that CASE was contemplating
                    suspending the schools from CaseTrust because of the suspension of the insurance
                    facilities and the time given was, at the most, one working day. In view of the
                    possible serious repercussions of a suspension of a membership, the provision of
                    one working day in which to render an explanation could hardly be considered as
                    sufficient opportunity for the schools to answer the allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The other requirement of cl 10, if it
                    applied, was that CASE had to conduct an independent investigation before
                    imposing the penalties permitted by that clause. The opening words of
                    cl 10.2 are “If CaseTrust concludes after its independent
                    investigation that a breach of this Code has occurred ...”. The parties
                    filed fairly lengthy submissions on why they said the duty of conducting an
                    independent investigation under this clause had or had not been complied with. I
                    do not have to consider those arguments in detail because it seems to me that
                    the independent investigation required by the sub-clause has as one of its
                    essential elements a consideration of the answers that the member being
                    investigated has made to the allegations being made against it. As such, in this
                    case, the independent investigation could not have been concluded because the
                    plaintiffs were not given a sufficient opportunity to answer the allegations as
                    required by cl 10.1. Therefore, if cl 10.2 applied, I would have held
                    CASE to be in breach of it because it imposed the penalty before its
                    investigation had been concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were CASE’s actions in breach of the CASE-PEO agreement and the
                Code of Practice?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In para 10 of the statement of claim,
                    the plaintiffs averred that it was a necessary implied term of the CASE-PEO
                    agreement and the Code that CASE would:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     comply strictly with the terms of
                        the CASE-PEO agreement when exercising its jurisdiction and powers to make
                        decisions affecting the rights and interests of PEOs and not exercise any
                        power which was an excess of its powers and jurisdiction;</p>

                        against them before calling upon the plaintiffs to answer the same in
                        connection with CASE’s investigations; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_e"></a>(e)     observe and comply with accepted
                        principles of natural justice and afford the plaintiffs the rights of a
                        reasonable opportunity to be heard before imposing any sanction for alleged
                        breaches of the Code or the CASE-PEO agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    did not take up all the pleaded points but shaped their case around the
                    arguments that CASE had breached the pleaded implied terms of the documents in
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a>(a)     CASE did not exercise its rights in
                        a reasonable manner;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a>(b)     CASE failed to give the plaintiffs notice of any charge preferred or
                        to be preferred against them before calling on them to answer the same in
                        connection with its investigation; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_c"></a>(c)     CASE failed to comply with principles of natural justice
                        before imposing sanctions for alleged breaches of the CASE-PEO agreement and
                        the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will deal with these issues in the
                    reverse order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    First, there is the question of the
                    application of the principles of natural justice. The plaintiffs in their
                    submissions linked adherence to the principles of natural justice to the
                    imposition of sanctions. As I have found that the suspensions were not
                    sanctions, it may be thought that this completely answers the question whether
                    CASE had any obligation to abide by the principles of natural justice in
                    relation to its actions under the CASE-PEO agreement and the Code. The
                    plaintiffs’ argument was that quite apart from cl 10, the rules of
                    natural justice had to be implied as part of their contract with CASE. In this
                    regard, they cited <em>Haron bin Mundir v Singapore Amateur
                        Athletic Association</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 494 where
                    Selvam J observed at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The device used by the courts to determine cases of expulsion or
                        suspension of members in an unincorporated association is by the application
                        of the doctrine of natural justice. The rules of natural justice are implied
                        into every contract express or implied which contemplates a hearing
                        affecting the rights and livelihood of persons. The rules are so implied as
                        a matter of law and public policy: <em>Lee v The
                            Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain</em> [1952]

                            Workers</em> [1965] Ch 712; <em>Russell v Duke of
                            Norfolk</em> [1949] 1 All ER 109.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    While I accept the statement of law
                    enunciated above and agree that generally speaking the rules of natural justice
                    apply in the type of situation described by Selvam J, there is other authority
                    which CASE brought to my attention which indicates that the dispensation or
                    exclusion of a right to be heard is permissible where such procedures would
                    hinder prompt action or where there is an urgent need to protect the interests
                    of third parties. <em>De Smith’s Judicial Review</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) notes that at common law procedural
                    propriety may be excluded in such circumstances. The text states at
                    para 8-019:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Urgency may warrant relaxing the requirements of
                            fairness even where there is no legislation under which this is
                            expressly permitted</em>. Thus a local authority could, without
                        any consultation, withdraw children from a special school after allegations
                        of persistent cruelty and abuse without this involving any procedural
                        impropriety. In such circumstances there exists an emergency in which the
                        primary concern is as to the safety and welfare of the children. The
                        suspension without first affording an opportunity to be heard, of a Romanian
                        Airline’s flight permit, following the failure by five of its pilots
                        of Civil Aviation Authority examinations in aviation law, flight rules, and
                        procedures, was not unfair where an immediate threat to air safety was
                        apprehended. Similarly where a self-regulatory organisation acted urgently
                        to protect investors, it was not required to consider whether there was
                        sufficient time to receive representations. Likewise, a local authority was
                        entitled to prohibit allegedly dangerous toys as an “emergency
                        holding operation”. <em>In general, whether the need
                            for urgent action outweighs the importance of notifying or consulting an
                            affected party depends on an assessment of the circumstances of each
                            case on which opinions can differ</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    CASE also cited two decisions in which the
                    propositions enunciated in the above extract were applied. The first was
                        <em>R v Life Assurance Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation
                        Ltd, Ex p. Ross</em> [1993] QB 17 (which report contains
                    both the first instance and appellate decisions) (“<em>Life Assurance</em>”). There, it was alleged that a
                    self-regulatory authority acted with procedural impropriety when it failed to
                    hear representations prior to suspending a member in the interests of protecting
                    public investors. The English Court of Appeal found that there was no breach of
                    the rules of natural justice and declared that the authority had to balance the
                    interests of the member against the interests of investors pending a full
                    inquiry into the matter. In that case, the need to urgently safeguard the
                    interests of investors outweighed the requirement to observe the rules of
                    procedural fairness. Glidewell LJ who delivered the judgment of the Court
                    of Appeal agreed with the observation of the judge at first instance, Mann LJ,
                    who had said (at p 32):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of an exercise of intervention powers under the Lautro rules,
                        or of an exercise under Part I of the Act of 1986, is the protection of
                        investors. The achievement of that purpose must on occasion require action
                        which has urgently to be taken, and the entertainment of representations may
                        not be compatible with the urgency. Mr. Collins recognised that this could
                        be so, but said that at least there must be a duty to consider whether time
                        admits of the receipt of representations and in this case there was no such
                        consideration by Lautro. <em>In my judgment, once it is
                            recognised, as inevitably it must be, that a self-regulating
                            organisation may have to act with urgency in order to achieve its
                            purpose, then it would be undesirable to cumber it with the necessity to
                            make a judgment as to whether time admits of an opportunity to make
                            representations</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Glidewell LJ added (at p 52) the
                    qualification that if a decision-making body is to exercise powers such as those
                    of serving an intervention notice without giving anybody the opportunity to make
                    representations beforehand, its procedures should provide that those who might
                    otherwise expect to have been allowed to make representations should at least be
                    allowed to make an immediate application to set the decision aside and to appeal
                    against it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The other case is <em>Suisse
                        Security Bank &amp; Trust Ltd v Governor of the Central Bank of The
                        Bahamas</em> [2006] 1 WLR 1660 (“<em>Suisse
                        Security Bank</em>”). There the authority had revoked the
                    bank’s licence to carry on banking and trust business on the ground that
                    the bank was carrying on its business in a manner detrimental to the public
                    interest and the interest of its depositors. The Privy Council held that where
                    the authority acted urgently to protect investors, it was not required to
                    consider whether there was sufficient time to receive representations. Lord
                    Mance, who delivered judgment on behalf of the Privy Council, held at [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Governor must be able to act quickly, in view of the various risks
                        that may materialize in a situation where, before he can act at all, he must
                        already be of the opinion that the bank’s business is being carried on
                        in a manner detrimental to the interests of the public or of depositors or
                        other creditors or in a situation like that under section 14(1)(b) where he
                        must be of the opinion that the bank is contravening one of his directions
                        or the Act itself. To require notice and an opportunity for objections in
                        such a situation would be bound in almost every case to lead to arguments
                        and delay. Meanwhile the bank’s existing management would be in charge
                        and have the continued opportunity – indeed what the less scrupulous
                        might see as a last chance – to act to its detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It is clear from the authorities cited
                    therefore that although generally the rules of natural justice apply when an
                    authority or quasi-authority such as CASE is making a decision that can have an
                    impact on the livelihood of an organisation whose behaviour it monitors, those
                    rules may not need to be followed if the circumstances require urgent action for
                    the protection of third parties and there is the possibility of representations
                    being received subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    CASE submits that it was entitled to
                    immediately suspend the schools without giving them a right to be heard, as an
                    interim measure or due to extenuating circumstances that is the suspension of
                    the schools’ insurance facilities by Income, thus putting future
                    students’ fees at risk. I accept this argument in the circumstances of
                    this case. It was not disputed that CaseTrust for Education and the Scheme were
                    established in order to safeguard foreign students’ tuition fees
                    especially in emergency situations such as may be initiated by the insolvency of
                    a PEO. Therefore, a PEO which wished to enrol foreign students was required to
                    become a member of CaseTrust and, in order to do so, had to have in place either
                    an escrow arrangement or an insurance facility. As the administrator of
                    CaseTrust for Education, CASE is responsible for ensuring that all its members
                    maintain valid insurance or escrow facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I agree with CASE that in the light of this
                    objective, as well as its role as the administrator of CaseTrust, it must have
                    the ability to take immediate interim measures, such as suspending members at
                    short notice, to ensure that the Scheme is adhered to. If CASE is not able to
                    act quickly when it finds out that a CaseTrust member does not have either
                    insurance facilities or an escrow arrangement in place, but has to give time for
                    due representations to be made, its ability to protect students would be
                    curtailed. This would mean that during the period when the representations are
                    being formulated and considered, the PEO concerned would still be able to enrol
                    foreign students and those students would not have the protection afforded by
                    the Scheme. This would defeat the purpose of the Scheme. Students’
                    interests will therefore be jeopardised if CASE must conduct a full
                    investigation and hear detailed representations each time a PEO is not a party
                    to a valid escrow or insurance scheme and can only suspend such PEO after this
                    process has been completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In the present case, once Income suspended
                    the schools’ insurance facilities, CASE had to act urgently to protect the
                    interests of foreign students who might be considering enrolling in the schools.
                    In these circumstances, I consider that CASE was entitled to make its decision
                    first and hear representations later, although in fact Ms Lee did inform
                    the schools of the impending suspension and did give them some opportunity to
                    put forward their case. The evidence also shows that after the suspensions took
                    effect, CASE continued to communicate with the schools and to receive their
                    representations. CASE looked into the contents of the letters sent on
                    28 November 2006 and when it found out that the insurance facilities had
                    not been restored, informed the schools of this fact and gave them up to
                    4 December 2006 to rectify the position. In any case, the plaintiffs’
                    complaint is confined to CASE’s alleged failure to allow the making of
                    representations before the suspension. They did not plead that CASE had breached
                    any of its obligations by its failure to afford the schools an opportunity to be
                    heard after the suspension.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I therefore find that quite apart from the
                    applicability of cl 10 of the Code of Practice, the rules of natural
                    justice did not apply to the circumstances which faced CASE when Income
                    suspended the schools’ insurance facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I move to the next sub-issue which is
                    whether CASE was obliged to give the plaintiffs notice of any charge preferred.
                    This issue can be considered as part of the applicability of the rules of
                    natural justice argument. In that light, the answer must be the same as that I
                    have given above to the assertion that CASE was obliged to give the plaintiffs
                    an opportunity to be heard before imposing the suspension. In any event, the
                    facts show that CASE did notify the plaintiffs of the matters that CASE was
                    investigating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    First, the letters of 14 November had
                    as their subject heading: “Discrepancies found between number of issued
                    student passes and number of students protected by insurance”. The
                    letters set out a monthly breakdown of the total number of student passes issued
                    and insurance applications submitted for each school and noted that there was a
                    shortfall. The plaintiffs were asked to explain the reasons for the discrepancy
                    and must have realised that there was an ongoing investigation by CASE. If CASE
                    had not carried out such an investigation, how could it have obtained the
                    figures in the letters?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Second, I have accepted Ms Lee’s
                    evidence that on 20 November 2006 she made it clear to Mr Yeo that
                    CASE was concerned about the suspension of the schools’ insurance
                    facilities by Income and also explained to him that CASE would suspend their
                    membership in CaseTrust if the insurance facilities were not
                restored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The plaintiffs complain that the Notices of
                    Suspension dated 20 November 2006 did not state the nature of the breach.
                    This is correct. What had happened was that CASE had used standard form
                    templates and had not applied its mind to the particular circumstances at hand.
                    It is clear from the Notices that they were generic in nature and not drafted
                    specifically to deal with the plaintiffs’ situation. However,
                    Ms Lee’s evidence, which I accept, was that she explained the reason
                    for the suspension to Mr Yeo and told him that the suspension of the
                    insurance facilities by Income constituted a breach of a key criterion of
                    CaseTrust for Education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The plaintiffs also allege that the
                    suspensions were effected without consideration by CASE as to whether there was
                    a valid legal basis for the same. This allegation is not supported by the
                    evidence. Mr Pillay and Ms Lee both testified that they had discussed
                    the legal effect of Income’s suspension of insurance facilities and had
                    concluded that the lack of a valid insurance facility was a breach of criterion
                    C.15 of the Info-Kit as well as cll 2.1(a) and (f) of the CASE-PEO
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In response to this evidence, the plaintiffs
                    argued that CASE’s allegation that it had breached criterion C15 of the
                    Info-Kit was clearly not sustainable. They say that this clause only refers to a
                    desktop assessment and a site assessment which needs to be used by a PEO in
                    order to prepare itself for the initial CaseTrust for Education accreditation.
                    It has no application to any point of time subsequent to the initial
                    accreditation. As far as cl 2.1 of the CASE-PEO agreement is concerned, the
                    plaintiffs say that it merely stipulates one of the conditions of the Scheme
                    which a PEO is obliged to comply with to gain CaseTrust for Education status.
                    Compliance is not required for the maintenance of that status.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I cannot accept that submission. Criterion
                    C15 is one of several criteria that an applicant for CaseTrust status has to
                    comply with. Among these are requirements like C2 which instructs the PEO to
                    issue a standard student contract which includes, as a mandatory requirement,
                    the PEO to commit itself to the Scheme so that the student’s fees will be
                    protected. In the standard student contract itself, the PEO confirms and
                    undertakes to the student that it has in place the insurance facilities required
                    under the scheme. This is a contract which is issued to all students after the
                    PEO attains CaseTrust membership and therefore it is envisaged that the
                    commitment to the Scheme will be a continuing one and not one that only needs to
                    exist at the time the application for membership is made. Other criteria in the
                    Info-Kit are also of a continuing nature, for example, the requirement under C1
                    that PEO has to provide students with receipts to acknowledge payment of fees to
                    itself or into the escrow account as the case may be, and C8 which requires the
                    PEO to maintain up-to-date databases on student records and details. Turning to
                    the CASE-PEO agreement, that document is all about the Scheme and the fulfilment
                    of the PEO’s obligations under the Scheme. Under cl 2.1 the PEO
                    warrants to CASE that it will satisfy the requirements of the Scheme by ensuring
                    that not less than 70% of the course fees of each student are protected either
                    by an escrow agreement or by insurance coverage. It is noteworthy that the word
                    “student” is defined as “any person who enrols for any
                    course of studies with [the schools] on or after 1 December 2004”. That
                    definition makes it obvious that the requirement to protect students in
                    accordance with the Scheme is not limited to students at any particular time but
                    applies to all students at any time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The plaintiffs’ submission was
                    effectively that under the CASE-PEO agreement and the terms and conditions of
                    membership in CaseTrust, the schools were merely obliged to comply with the
                    requirement of having a Scheme facility in place prior to accreditation and once
                    accredited they were no longer obliged to sustain the facility and provide
                    protection under the Scheme to their students. Such an interpretation runs
                    contrary to the entire purpose of the Scheme and for that reason alone must be
                    rejected. Additionally, as I have pointed out above, it is not supported by the
                    language of the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I move on to the final issue in this area,
                    which is whether there was an implied term that CASE would exercise its rights
                    under the CASE-PEO agreement and the Code of Practice in a reasonable manner
                    and, if so, whether in this instance those rights were so
                exercised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In its closing submissions, CASE pointed out
                    that the plaintiffs had simply assumed that the duty on CASE to exercise its
                    rights in a reasonable manner was implied into the documents without explaining
                    the factual and/or legal basis for this assertion. CASE recognised that for the
                    implication of a term into a contract, the term must be either necessary to give
                    “business efficacy” to the agreement or must satisfy the
                    “officious bystander” test as something so obvious that it goes
                    without saying. CASE submitted that neither of these tests was satisfied in the
                    instant case. I do not agree. I think that in a situation such as this, which is
                    not a strictly commercial contract but where, although the form of the
                    relationship is contractual, in fact one party is an arbiter who decides whether
                    the other party is able to do a particular act which affects the livelihood of
                    that second party, any decision taken by the first party which may have an
                    adverse effect on the second’s earning capacity must not be an
                    unreasonable decision. Anything else would be an abuse of power. To me, this
                    requirement would definitely satisfy the officious bystander test as both
                    parties would operate on the unspoken assumption that those powers would be
                    exercised in a rational manner and not capriciously and would inform the
                    officious bystander so if he were to pose the question. But even if this term
                    did not pass the officious bystander test, in the light of all the
                    circumstances, it is my view that administrative law principles should be
                    imported into the relationship between CASE and the plaintiffs in relation to
                    CASE’s decision-making powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    I therefore move on to consider whether CASE
                    acted unreasonably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The plaintiffs gave various reasons for
                    their submission that CASE had not exercised its rights in a reasonable manner.
                    First, they note that Mr Seah had testified that CASE’s primary
                    principle in administering CaseTrust for Education was that there had to be
                    maximum student protection. They argue that between the option of suspending the
                    schools and the option of asking them to make good the insurance premiums for
                    the uninsured students, the latter option would have been more in line with the
                    primary principle of maximum student protection. CASE, however, did not extend
                    this option. Further, instead of suspending the schools and leaving over 400 of
                    the students exposed, CASE could have obtained an undertaking from the
                    plaintiffs not to enrol more foreign students until either the premiums had been
                    paid under the Scheme for the uninsured students or the plaintiffs had made
                    alternative escrow arrangements. The plaintiffs consider that CASE’s
                    assertion that the situation was so urgent that it had no choice but to suspend
                    as being completely baseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The second contention was that Ms Lee
                    had unilaterally decided to start an investigation into the plaintiffs. On 16
                    October 2006, she had been informed of the various rumours regarding the schools
                    by the STB and had later been asked to check with Income whether the latter
                    could commence a financial health check on the plaintiffs as part of the regular
                    insurance process. Instead of doing so, Ms Lee admitted that she had
                    unilaterally, without consulting either Mr Seah or Mr Pillay, started
                    an investigation into whether the plaintiffs had complied with the Scheme.
                    Further, she had written to Income to inform it that CASE was conducting
                    investigations and instead of asking Mr Teo to commence a financial health
                    check on the plaintiffs, she asked for certain details from him. Ms Lee had
                    agreed in court that if the plaintiffs had made good the unpaid premiums, this
                    would have indicated whether they were solvent or not but, in the 14 November
                    letters, she did not relay this position to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The third contention is that CASE was aware
                    of the discrepancies in the insurance figures as early as 3 November 2006
                    but waited 11 days until 14 November 2006 before writing to the plaintiffs
                    to request for their comments. If the situation was indeed so urgent because
                    more than 400 students were not insured and CASE needed to act immediately, it
                    would have been reasonable to expect that CASE would have written immediately to
                    the plaintiffs. When the letters were sent on 14 November, they were posted
                    and thus would not be received immediately. This did not indicate urgency. On
                    top of that, CASE suspended the plaintiffs on 20 November 2006 although the
                    deadline given in the letters for the plaintiffs’ response was
                    23 November 2006. Pointing out that Ms Lee had told the court that she
                    had not written to the plaintiffs before 14 November 2006 as she was on
                    leave to attend to personal matters relating to her new flat, the plaintiffs
                    submit that if the situation had indeed been so urgent, Ms Lee could have
                    got someone to attend to the matter in her absence instead of waiting 11 days to
                    write to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Dealing with the first point, CASE argues
                    that it was not under any obligation to consider or offer the proposed
                    “alternatives” of asking the plaintiffs to make good the insurance
                    premiums for the uninsured students and getting an undertaking from them not to
                    enrol more foreign students. It says that the plaintiffs never offered or even
                    suggested to CASE that the schools would make good the insurance premiums or
                    provide an undertaking in lieu of a suspension. When this question was asked of
                    Mr Seah in court, he responded that CASE had not been presented with these
                    options and therefore had not thought of them at that time. CASE argues that
                    since the plaintiffs did not make the offer either before or during the
                    suspension, it does not lie in their mouths to claim that CASE was in breach of
                    contract for failing to consider such an undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Whilst I agree that it is a bit late for the
                    plaintiffs to put forward alternatives for CASE’s consideration since they
                    did not bring up these points at the time of suspension, the main point here is
                    whether such alternatives were really feasible at the time and if it was
                    unreasonable not to impose them instead of the suspension. As far as the
                    suggestion of making good the insurance premiums is concerned, that really was
                    not a course that was open to either of the schools. The plaintiffs had not
                    applied for insurance for these students so there were no outstanding premiums.
                    Further, the very fact of the Income suspension meant that no further
                    application could be made until such suspension was lifted. It would therefore
                    have been pointless for CASE to direct the schools to pay the premiums. Such
                    direction could not have been complied with and would not have addressed
                    CASE’s concerns regarding compliance with the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In relation to the undertaking, CASE’s
                    submission is that it would not have been prepared to accept such an undertaking
                    from the schools who were already in breach of the CASE-PEO agreement. Under
                    cross-examination, Mr Seah stressed that CASE “would be hard put to
                    agree” to such an undertaking and Mr Pillay also expressed doubts
                    that it would be acceptable. Counsel argues that this attitude was not
                    surprising or unreasonable because in their letters dated 28 November 2006, the
                    schools had claimed that the situation had been rectified and this assertion had
                    turned out to be untrue in that Income had not lifted the suspension and the 479
                    students were still uninsured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Having considered the matter, I do not think
                    it was unreasonable for CASE to suspend the schools rather than to call on them
                    to give an undertaking not to enrol foreign students until they were compliant
                    with the Scheme again. This is because the facts known to CASE showed that the
                    schools had not insured their students for a period of about five to six months
                    with the result that practically all foreign students had not been insured. This
                    was a serious breach of the terms of the Scheme. Secondly, the schools had not
                    given a detailed explanation of how the omissions had occurred and had not
                    indicated what steps they had taken to ensure that such omissions would not
                    recur. The explanatory letters of 20 November 2006 were vague –
                    attributing the “oversight” to a mix of administrative factors.
                    Thirdly, the plaintiffs had not volunteered such an undertaking. In the absence
                    of an effort on the part of the plaintiffs to convince CASE that there was a
                    workable alternative which they would adhere to and had the administrative
                    facilities to implement, it was not unreasonable for CASE to put in place what
                    amounted to a compulsory suspension of recruitment of foreign students rather
                    than to ask for a voluntary suspension of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The second point was that it was
                    unreasonable for Ms Lee to unilaterally commence an investigation into the
                    schools’ compliance with the Scheme. I see no merit in this point. The
                    evidence was that one of Ms Lee’s duties as a CaseTrust executive was
                    to carry out such investigations and that she was given full authority and
                    discretion to do so. Mr Seah confirmed that she had the authority to
                    investigate into whether CaseTrust members had complied with CaseTrust
                    requirements. Ms Lee herself testified that it was her responsibility to
                    conduct checks to determine whether there were any discrepancies between the
                    figures provided by Income and the banks and those provided by the ICA. Whilst
                    Ms Lee generally conducted such checks on a random basis, the impetus for
                    the checks in the present case was given when the STB alerted her to the rumours
                    about the schools’ financial position. As it was CASE’s role to
                    protect students from the consequences of a PEO’s insolvency, it was only
                    natural that this information triggered Ms Lee’s investigations.
                    There was nothing at all unreasonable in her decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The third point relates to the delay between
                    the discovery of the number of uninsured students and the writing of the
                    14 November letters. Here again, the criticism is baseless. CASE did not
                    have any obligation to inform the schools immediately after it learnt of the
                    schools’ non-compliance with the Scheme. In any case, it was not the
                    discovery of the 479 uninsured students that led to the suspension of membership
                    but the fact that Income suspended the insurance facilities on 17 November
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I therefore find that CASE was not in breach
                    of any implied term to act reasonably or to observe and comply with the rules of
                    natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second category of issues: has CASE any liability in tort?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Intention to induce a breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The first assertion that the plaintiffs make
                    in this part of the claim is that CASE wrongfully and recklessly induced and
                    procured the breach by Income of its obligations to the plaintiffs. In dealing
                    with this part of the plaintiffs’ claim, I will not consider the issue of
                    whether Income was in breach of contract when it suspended the insurance
                    facilities on 20 October 2006. That question can be dealt with more conveniently
                    in the next portion of this judgment in which I consider the plaintiffs’
                    claims against Income. For present purposes, I will assume that Income’s
                    action was in fact a breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The plaintiffs accept, citing <em>Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd v Dafni Igal</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 426 (“<em>Zim</em>”), that in
                    order to make out this claim, they must show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_145-p2_a"></a>(a)     CASE acted with the requisite
                        knowledge of the existence of the contract between themselves and Income
                        (although knowledge of the precise terms is unnecessary);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_145-p2_b"></a>(b)     CASE intended
                        to interfere with the plaintiffs’ contractual
                        rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">They also note that the court in <em>Zim</em> emphasised that the plaintiff in such an action must
                    show that the defendant in question knew that it was procuring a breach of
                    contract and it would not be sufficient merely to show that the acts committed
                    by the defendant had the effect of procuring such breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The plaintiffs point out that CASE knew that
                    the schools had procured insurance policies from Income and that those insurance
                    policies were a vital requirement for the schools to be able to secure student
                    passes for their foreign students. The first ingredient has therefore been
                    met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The action that the plaintiffs complain
                    about is the e-mail that Ms Lee sent to Income on 20 October 2006. They
                    complain that she had recklessly and without any basis whatsoever alleged the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... both the schools may be closing down soon due to losses incurred
                        during their investments in India ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">CaseTrust, together with those governing agencies are highly concerned at
                        this stage ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">During cross-examination, Ms Lee had
                    conceded that the only government agency that had concerns was STB and even then
                    the extent of the concern was simply to ask if a financial health check could be
                    commenced by Income. The plaintiffs thought that it was because of the
                    allegations in that e-mail that Income decided that day to suspend the
                    “bond facility” with the plaintiffs. When Ms Lee received
                    Mr Teo’s reply informing her about the suspension of the “bond
                    facility”, she did not even ask him why Income had done so. Looking at
                    Ms Lee’s conduct as a whole <em>ie</em> in
                    sending the e-mail to Mr Teo and in failing to ask him why Income had taken
                    action to suspend in view of CASE’s investigation, the plaintiffs submit
                    that the reasonable inference to be drawn was that Ms Lee intended to
                    procure a breach of Income’s contract with the plaintiffs at the time she
                    sent the e-mail to Mr Teo on 20 October 2006. They emphasise that
                    Mr Teo had stated that he was highly concerned that the plaintiffs might be
                    in financial distress purely because of Ms Lee’s
                e-mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In the circumstances here, the first
                    ingredient of the tort presents no problem to the plaintiffs. What has to be
                    considered is the second ingredient <em>ie</em> whether
                    CASE intended to interfere with the schools’ contractual rights <em>vis-a-vis</em> Income. CASE submitted that a survey of the
                    evidence established that CASE had absolutely no intention of procuring a breach
                    of the SPS policies and, at the very least, the plaintiffs had failed to show
                    that CASE possessed the requisite objective intent. The fact that CASE’s
                    actions may have led to the breach as Mr Teo stated, was irrelevant if CASE
                    had not intended this result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    I agree that the plaintiffs have not made
                    out this claim. Their case rests on the portions of Ms Lee’s e-mail
                    to Mr Teo that I have set out at <a href="#p1_147">[147]</a>
                    above. Those were selective portions of the text. The full text of the e-mail
                    can be found at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above. If the text of
                    the e-mail and the circumstances in which it was sent are considered in full, it
                    is quickly apparent that CASE had no intention whatsoever when it sent the
                    e-mail to have any effect on the contractual relations between the plaintiffs
                    and Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    It is evident from the contemporaneous
                    correspondence between CASE, STB and Income that Ms Lee sent out the e-mail
                    in question because of a specific request by STB. The rumour that the schools
                    “may be closing down soon” originated from a tip off received by
                    STB who communicated it to CASE on 16 October 2006 and asked CASE to
                    “check with the banks (on escrow default) and/or NTUC Income on whether
                    they can commence a financial health check on the school as part of their
                    regular insurance process”. Three days after this specific request was
                    made, Ms Lee sent an e-mail to Mr Teo asking for, <em>inter alia</em>, a financial health report on the schools. The first
                    e-mail that she sent out did not mention the rumours and it was only a request
                    for information and details of the schools. This is an indication that CASE was
                    simply acting on a request by STB and had no intention of procuring any breach
                    of contract by Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    It was only after Mr Teo asked for
                    details of the investigation that Ms Lee replied on 20 October in
                    terms of the e-mail that the plaintiffs rely on. At that stage, she told him
                    about the tip off but did not make any request that Income take action against
                    the schools. She was careful to inform him that “more concrete
                    evidence” was needed to substantiate the rumours and this was a clear
                    signal that the rumours had not yet been substantiated. The e-mail cannot be
                    read as a call to action by Income: all that it did was to endeavour to explain
                    why CASE had asked for certain information. I think that the plaintiffs’
                    case on the meaning of the e-mail is exaggerated and without
                foundation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    There is also no merit in their argument
                    that Ms Lee’s failure to ask Mr Teo why Income was suspending
                    the “bond facility” indicated that CASE had intended to procure a
                    breach. I have found above that Ms Lee did not know what Mr Teo meant
                    by “bond facility”. She was used to the term “SPS
                    facility”. Since no alarm bells were rung, her failure to question
                    Mr Teo further about his actions meant nothing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Since the plaintiffs have not been able to
                    establish that CASE intended to affect their contractual relations with Income,
                    this claim must fail. There is no need for me to go on to consider whether in
                    fact it was the e-mail of 20 October 2006 that caused the suspension of the
                    insurance facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The second assertion which the plaintiffs
                    have made is that CASE had a duty of care to not act in any manner that would
                    adversely affect the contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and Income
                    and to administer CaseTrust in such a manner so as not to cause loss or damage
                    to the plaintiffs. They say that CASE breached that duty of care and caused them
                    loss. In respect of this allegation, the first issue that arises is whether such
                    a duty of care existed between CASE and the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The plaintiffs cite the decision of the High
                    Court in <em>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Kim
                        Eric</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 853 (“<em>Sunny Metal</em>”) as authority for the proposition that a
                    defendant can owe concurrent duties to a plaintiff in contract and in tort. As a
                    generality, that proposition is not in doubt. That does not mean, however, that
                    in every case of a contractual relationship there will also be concurrent
                    tortious duties. That question can only be answered by reference to the test
                    which has to be applied to determine whether in any set of circumstances a
                    tortious duty exists. The latest authority on the applicable test to determine
                    the existence of a duty of care is the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology
                        Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”). There, Chan Sek Keong CJ said at
                        [115]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A <em>single</em> test to determine the existence of
                        a duty of care should be applied regardless of the nature of the damage
                        caused (<em>ie</em>, pure economic loss or physical
                        damage). It could be that a more restricted approach is preferable for cases
                        of pure economic loss but this is to be done within the confines of a single
                        test. This test is a two-stage test, comprising of, first, proximity and,
                        second, policy considerations. These two stages are to be approached with
                        reference to the facts of decided cases although the absence of such cases
                        is not an absolute bar against a finding of duty. There is, of course, the
                        threshold issue of factual foreseeability but since this is likely to be
                        fulfilled in most cases, we do not see the need to include this as part of
                        the <em>legal</em> test for a duty of care. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    From the above extract, it can be seen that
                    the starting point in the determination of whether a duty of care exists is to
                    consider the threshold issue of factual foreseeability. In the present instance,
                    the question is whether it would have been foreseeable to CASE that negligence
                    on its part in relation to the administration of CaseTrust would cause loss or
                    damage to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs submit that by virtue of the
                    contractual relationship between them and CASE as set out in the CASE-PEO
                    agreements, the Code of Practice and the Info-Kit, it was reasonably foreseeable
                    that revoking the schools’ CaseTrust membership would cause the plaintiffs
                    to suffer economic loss and loss of reputation. CASE published the
                    schools’ suspension on its website and Mr Seah had admitted during
                    the course of cross-examination that it was foreseeable that the media would
                    check the website and pick up the fact of the suspension and publish the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In its closing submissions, CASE did not
                    dispute that it was reasonably foreseeable that a revocation or suspension of
                    the schools’ membership in CaseTrust could result in loss to them. I
                    therefore accept that the threshold test of reasonable foreseeability has been
                    met in this instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Moving on, I must next consider whether the
                    proximity test has been met and if so there are any policy considerations which
                    would militate against the imposition of the duty of care contended
                for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    In <em>Sunny
                    Metal</em>, the main contractor of a construction project did not meet its
                    obligations under its design and build contract with the plaintiff. The
                    plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, the architect employed by the
                    main contractor, based on a deed of indemnity between the plaintiff and the
                    defendant and also on the tort of negligence for pure economic loss. At first
                    instance, the plaintiff succeeded. In the course of his judgment, Andrew
                    Phang J observed (at [120]) that
                    there was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">no difficulty whatsoever in establishing legal proximity between the
                        plaintiff and the defendant in the present proceedings simply because there
                        was <em>a contractual relationship</em> between them in
                        the first instance. Generally speaking, given the fact that a defendant will
                        not be allowed to be better off in tort than it would have been in contract
                        where concurrent liability exists, it is no surprise that – depending
                        on the precise contractual terms – it is more likely than not that
                        legal proximity will be established where there is a contractual
                        relationship between the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On appeal by the defendant, the Court of Appeal in Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Kim Eric [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782, reversed the decision on liability,
                    primarily on the basis of the construction of the deed. It stated that since the
                    deed did not impose the additional duties of care argued for by the plaintiff,
                    it necessarily followed that the deed could not provide the proximity between
                    the plaintiff and the defendant on a tortious basis. It also considered whether,
                    apart from the deed, there was any evidence of legal proximity and held that
                    there was not because the plaintiff had not relied on the defendant to fulfil
                    his alleged additional duties to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    It would appear therefore that a contract
                    between parties can create the proximity required for an action in negligence if
                    it creates the duties of care relied on by one of the parties. If it does not,
                    the contract in itself may not be sufficient to constitute proximity between
                    them. In the present case, the duties allegedly created were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_a"></a>(a)     that CASE had a duty to take
                        reasonable care not to act in any manner which would adversely affect the
                        contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and Income;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_b"></a>(b)     that CASE had
                        a duty to administer the CaseTrust membership scheme in such a manner so as
                        not to act to cause loss or damage to the plaintiffs when exercising its
                        powers under the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    There is nothing in the CASE-PEO agreements
                    or the Info-Kit or the Code of Practice that expressly imposes such duties on
                    CASE. Nor, in my opinion, can such duties be implied from the documents because
                    the duties sought to be imposed are inimical to any attempt by CASE to properly
                    carry out its duties as the administrator of CaseTrust for Education. If such
                    duties existed, CASE would be duty bound to any PEO that was a member of
                    CaseTrust for Education not to exercise any of its powers under the various
                    documents in a manner that would cause loss or damage. Taken to its logical
                    extreme, this would mean that CASE would not be able to, <em>inter alia</em>, suspend or expel its members since the exercise of
                    such powers may conceivably result in some loss or damage or in the withdrawal
                    of insurance facilities. CASE’s role is to administer a scheme intended to
                    benefit third parties (<em>ie</em> foreign students) and to
                    take all necessary action to ensure that that scheme is properly implemented and
                    adhered to by all CaseTrust members. To impose a duty on an administrator not to
                    act in a manner detrimental to its members, no matter what the circumstances,
                    would be contrary to its duty to the third parties and also to its
                    responsibilities as administrator. The interests of the third parties and those
                    of the members are not always aligned. Here CASE’s duty is to act
                    primarily in the interests of foreign students as the same are embodied in the
                    Scheme and, if to do so means that CASE has to act against the interests of a
                    member, then CASE would have to choose the interests of the students over those
                    of the member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Accordingly, I would hold that the
                    contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and CASE does not result in the
                    proximity required for the imposition of the alleged duties in tort. In any
                    case, even if there was proximity, I would have held that by reason of policy
                    considerations (<em>ie</em> the considerations set out in
                        <a href="#p1_161">[161]</a> above) no such duties should be
                    imposed on CASE. In <em>Pacific Associates v Baxter</em>
                    [1990] 1 QB 993, Russell LJ observed (at p 1038):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would hold that, the parties having sought to regulate their
                        relationships the one with the other by a contractual process, the law
                        should be cautious indeed before grafting on to the contractual
                        relationships what might be termed a parasitic duty, unnecessary for the
                        protection of the interests of the parties. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I respectfully agree. The terms of the
                    CASE-PEO agreements, the Code of Practice and the Info-Kit were drafted to
                    achieve a certain purpose and I cannot graft onto those terms any duties that
                    would undermine them or have the effect of changing the relationship and
                    responsibilities of the schools with, and to, CASE. The documents already
                    contain terms for the protection of the interests of the schools (for example
                    cl 10 of the Code of Practice) and the courts should be slow to add to or
                    modify such terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I conclude therefore that there is no basis
                    on which the plaintiffs can pursue any claim in tort against CASE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ claim against Income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    In their pleadings, the plaintiffs set out
                    three bases of claim against Income. First, they averred that the following were
                    implied terms of the SPS policies:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_a"></a>(a)     that Income would act with the
                        utmost good faith in its dealings with the plaintiffs under the SPS
                        policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
                        Income would act reasonably and not in an arbitrary and/or capricious manner
                        in administering the SPS policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_c"></a>(c)     that Income would comply strictly with the terms of the
                        SPS policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_d"></a>(d)     that Income would not conduct itself in any manner which would frustrate
                        the obligations of Income under the SPS policies; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_e"></a>(e)     that Income would take into account
                        matters that were relevant to Income’s assessment of risk under the
                        SPS policies and would not consider or act upon matters which were
                        irrelevant to the said assessment of risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The plaintiffs then pleaded that the
                    following actions of Income breached either one or all of the implied terms set
                    out above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_a"></a>(a)     on 20 October 2006, unilaterally
                        without any reference to the plaintiffs and without any notification
                        whatsoever to the plaintiffs, Income suspended the plaintiffs’
                        insurance facilities under the SPS policies with immediate
                    effect;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_b"></a>(b)     Income
                        had, wrongfully and unilaterally, without notifying the plaintiffs of the
                        same, denied all access by the plaintiffs to Income’s SPS online
                        application system. The plaintiffs discovered this on 9 November 2006.
                        By reason of this, the plaintiffs were unable to obtain Certificates of
                        Student Insurance for their prospective foreign students;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_165-p2_c"></a>(c)     on 20 November
                        2006, the plaintiffs were told that Income had been informed by CASE that
                        there was an ongoing investigation into the plaintiffs and that for this
                        reason, Income’s insurance facilities under the SPS policies would be
                        suspended until further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    The plaintiffs’ alternative claim was
                    couched in tort. They averred that at all material times, Income owed them a
                    duty of care to ensure that it acted reasonably in administering the insurance
                    facilities so as not to cause loss or damage to the plaintiffs. They pleaded
                    that Income had acted negligently or in breach of its duty of care in
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_a"></a>(a)     Income on 20 October 2006 suspended
                        the insurance facility under the SPS policies with immediate effect;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_b"></a>(b)     on a
                        date which the plaintiffs are unable to particularise until discovery and/or
                        the administration of interrogatories, Income denied the plaintiffs access
                        to the SPS online application system; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_c"></a>(c)     Income on 20 November 2006, again suspended the
                        insurance facility under the SPS policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The third averment was that Income had
                    wrongfully and recklessly procured the breach by CASE of the CASE-PEO agreement.
                    The conduct relied on to support this averment was:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_167-p2_a"></a>(a)     Income’s unlawful suspension
                        of the plaintiffs’ rights under the SPS policies on 20 October
                        2006 and their reckless communication of this decision to CASE;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_167-p2_b"></a>(b)     Income’s
                        unlawful suspension of the plaintiffs’ rights under the SPS policies
                        on 17 November 2006 and their reckless communication of this decision
                        to CASE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the alternative to the inducement of
                    breach of contract, the plaintiffs relying on the same conduct as set out above
                    pleaded that Income had unlawfully interfered with the contractual relationship
                    between the plaintiffs and CASE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    highlighted the main issues arising in their case against Income to be as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether on a true and proper
                        construction of the clauses in the SPS policies, Income had a contractual
                        right to suspend the plaintiffs’ insurance
                    facilities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Income had breached the implied terms of the SPS
                    policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
                        Income had wrongfully and recklessly induced and procured the breach by CASE
                        of its contractual obligations to the plaintiffs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether Income had breached its duty
                        of care owed to the plaintiffs to ensure that it would act reasonably in
                        administering the SPS policies so as not to cause loss or damage to the
                        plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    What I said in respect of the first and
                    second plaintiffs’ respective positions in <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> above would also apply in relation to Income.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did Income have a right under the SPS policies to suspend the
                plaintiffs’ facilities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The first issue is one of construction of
                    the clauses in the SPS policies. The plaintiffs’ position is that on a
                    true and proper construction of cll 6.3 and 7 of the SPS policies, Income did
                    not have the contractual right to suspend the availability of the insurance
                    facilities either on 20 October 2006 or on 17 November 2006. These
                    clauses are set out in full in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The plaintiffs submit that cl 6.3
                    relates to a review of the Maximum Insurable Limit and the decrease or increase
                    or withdrawal of that limit. It does not relate to the freezing of new insurance
                    applications. Further, Income’s argument that the decrease or withdrawal
                    of the Maximum Insurable Limit would be the same as freezing the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance policies fails <em>in
                        limine</em> as cl 6.3 specifically requires that written notice
                    be given to the plaintiffs and this was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    In respect of cl 7, the plaintiffs say
                    that on a plain and ordinary meaning of this clause, it only gives Income the
                    right to decline cover on a case by case basis when and if, and only if, an
                    application for insurance was made. They submit that Mr Teo had conceded
                    during the course of cross-examination that this clause gives Income the right
                    to accept or reject an insurance application but does not give it the right to
                    freeze all new insurance applications. The evidence of Ms Chua from Income
                    that Income online application system did not allow it to decline applications
                    and therefore Income had to reset the schools’ passwords in order to
                    refuse applications, was not meritorious. Ms Chua had conceded that in
                    resetting the passwords, Income was not rejecting applications on a case by case
                    basis but was stopping applications from all prospective applicants. The
                    plaintiffs submit that Income’s right under cl 7 to reject any
                    application for insurance was not invoked by the resetting of the passwords
                    because this method meant that no application could be made at all for Income to
                    consider whether it should accept or decline the same. Clause 7 does not permit
                    an en bloc pre-emptive rejection of future applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The plaintiffs also point out that in his
                    affidavit as well as during the course of cross-examination, Mr Teo had
                    confirmed that prior to the notification of Income’s suspension of the
                    plaintiffs’ SPS policies, he was aware that Income had the following legal
                    options in regard to the facilities extended:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_173-p2_a"></a>(a)     to choose to reduce the Maximum
                        Insurable Limits of the SPS policies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_173-p2_b"></a>(b)     to require the plaintiffs to provide more security to
                        maintain the current Maximum Insurable Limits of the SPS policies;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_173-p2_c"></a>(c)     to cancel the
                        plaintiffs’ SPS policies altogether by giving them at least 30 days
                        prior written notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Income had not chosen any of those options
                    but had instead taken the unlawful “option” of suspending the
                    plaintiffs’ insurance facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Income’s response was that it had the
                    power to suspend the policies under both cll 6.3 and 7 and that these clauses
                    gave it wide ranging powers to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_174-p2_a"></a>(a)     reject any new applications without
                        giving reasons; and</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">unilaterally increase, decrease or withdraw the
                        Maximum Insurable Limit.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">These rights were a recognition of
                    Income’s unqualified prerogative not to take on additional
                risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Relying on <em>Yamashita
                        Tetsuo v See Hup Seng Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 265, Income
                    submits that the contextual approach to statutory interpretation which is well
                    established in local jurisprudence should be followed in this case. Having
                    regard to the purpose of the clauses in question, which was to afford Income a
                    right to limit its exposure to additional risks, cll 6.3 and 7 clearly give
                    Income the right to do what it did, which was to prevent any further
                    applications from being made by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Income emphasises that under cl 7 it
                    had the “right to accept or reject [any application], without having to
                    provide reasons therefor” and points out that the architecture of the
                    online system was such that all applications were automatically approved. Thus,
                    the only way for Income to reject an application was for it to deny the
                    plaintiffs’ access by changing the passwords to the system. This was
                    apparent from Ms Chua’s evidence. The substance of Income’s
                    right under cl 7 was the ability to reject applications. In theory, there
                    were two ways for Income to exercise such a right: first, by rejecting each
                    application one at a time and the other was to reject all applications by
                    changing the login password. It was not possible for Income to reject
                    applications individually because of the way the online application system was
                    calibrated. The only way of rejecting applications was to change the login
                    password. As such, in order to make cl 7 workable, it had to be construed
                    to permit Income to deny the plaintiffs access to the online application system.
                    In this regard, Income cites <em>The Interpretation of
                        Contracts</em> by Kim Lewison QC (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2004, 3rd Ed)
                    at para 7.14 for the rule that where two constructions of an instrument are
                    equally plausible, upon one of which the instrument is valid, and upon the other
                    of which the instrument is invalid, the court should lean towards that
                    construction which validates the instrument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Considering cl 7 first, the question
                    that arises is whether the right to reject applications that is given to Income
                    by that clause has to be exercised on a case by case basis or whether it can, as
                    contended by Income, be applied across the board to all new applications even
                    before the same have been made. During the course of the trial, my reading of
                    cl 7 was in line with that propounded by the plaintiffs. I have now been
                    able to consider the clause further, however, and to have regard to the
                    established canons of interpretations of contracts. The plain and ordinary
                    meaning of the words “right to accept or reject ... any
                    application” are that they refer to a very wide right especially since
                    the same is further extended by the express provision that no reasons need be
                    given for such action. Not having to explain its decisions implies that Income
                    is at total liberty to reject an application for whatever reason it deems fit or
                    for no reason at all or without even considering the application. If Income is
                    able to reject an application without even considering it, it must also have the
                    right to not receive the application at all since it can be said that refusing
                    to receive an application is equivalent to rejecting it. The plaintiffs’
                    submission that Income only has the right to decline cover on a case by case
                    basis if, and only if, an application is made implies that cl 7 imposes an
                    obligation to consider any application for insurance coverage before rejecting
                    the same without giving reasons. In my view, it is absurd to impose an
                    obligation to consider an application when you are entitled to refuse it at your
                    absolute discretion. Therefore, a plain reading of cl 7 did permit
                    Income’s blanket and pre-emptive rejection of applications for insurance
                    coverage by resetting the plaintiffs’ passwords to the
                system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    That is not the end of the matter, however,
                    because another canon of construction requires that one must read specific terms
                    as prevailing over general terms. <em>MacGillivray on Insurance
                        Law</em> (Nicholas Leigh-Jones Gen Ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed,
                    2008) (“<em>MacGillivray</em>”) states at
                    para 11-029:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clauses of specific application may contradict clauses of general
                        application which, if they stood alone, would control the specific
                        subject-matter, and the clause of specific application then controls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Here, cl 7 is a provision which gives
                    Income the right to refuse applications for cover without having to provide any
                    reason. It can be used to refuse one, a few, or many applications and therefore
                    is of general application. Clause 6.3, on the other hand, is a provision
                    relating to one specific situation – the situation where Income wishes to
                    “withdraw the available balance of Maximum Insurable Limit for new
                    applications for insurance cover”. The clause provides that in that
                    situation, Income has to give the policyholder written notice. The rejection of
                    one or two insurance applications would not fall within cl 6.3 but if
                    Income decides that it is going to exercise its rights under cl 7 to reject
                    all future applications by resetting the passwords so that applications cannot
                    even be received, then in effect it would be withdrawing the available balance
                    of the Maximum Insurable Limit. This is because, in my view, a pre-emptive
                    rejection of all applications for insurance coverage is tantamount to
                    withdrawing the available balance of the Maximum Insurable Limit for new
                    applications for insurance coverage pursuant to cl 6.3. The effects and
                    implications of the two actions cannot be distinguished. In this situation,
                    therefore, the provisions of both cll 6.3 and 7 would apply and, because
                    the specific provision overrides the general one, Income would have to comply
                    with the requirement of cl 6.3 and give the requisite written
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    In the present case, although Income used
                    the word “suspend”, its resetting of the plaintiffs’
                    passwords in October 2006 meant that the plaintiffs were not able to apply for
                    any insurance policy at all and therefore effectively meant that Income had
                    withdrawn the available balance of the Maximum Insurable Limits of each of the
                    SPS policies under cl 6.3. For such action to be permissible under the
                    clause, Income had to comply with the written notice requirement it mandates. No
                    notice was given to the schools on that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Income accepts that the
                    “suspension” which took place on 20 October 2006 was
                    essentially a withdrawal of the Maximum Insurable Limit under cl 6.3. It
                    recognises that the court will look at the substance of the action and not the
                    label that is attached to it. Income, however, submits that although it did not
                    give notice of the suspension on 20 October 2006, it did so at the earliest
                    appropriate time on 20 November 2006. The reason for the delay in giving
                    notice was that Income did not wish to jeopardise the investigations that were
                    being undertaken by CASE. Further, Income contends that cl 6.3 does not
                    state that immediate notice must be given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In my judgment, Income was in breach of
                    cl 6.3 on 20 October 2006 when it reset the schools passwords for
                    logging onto the online application system. The breach arose because Income did
                    not notify the first plaintiff of its action. I do not accept that Income was
                    entitled to delay notification. Clause 6.3 states that the decrease of the
                    Maximum Insurable Limit can be done “with immediate effect by giving
                    written notice to the PEO”. This clearly means that the withdrawal only
                    takes effect when the notice is given. It is not a question of the clause
                    requiring the notice to be immediate so much as the clause providing that the
                    power of withdrawal can only be exercised by the giving of notice. If Income
                    does not give notice of what it is doing, then its action does not fall under
                    cl 6.3 and is not permitted by the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Returning to the issue at hand which is
                    whether Income had the contractual right to suspend the schools’ insurance
                    facilities, the answer to this question is that Income did have that right
                    provided it exercised it in accordance with the provisions of the SPS policies.
                    As far as the suspension on 20 October 2006 was concerned, since no notice
                    was given, Income acted in breach of contract. However, when Income gave the
                    schools notice on 20 November 2006 that it had suspended their insurance
                    facilities, that notice complied with cl 6.3 and, accordingly, it effected
                    an immediate withdrawal of the available balance of the Maximum Insurable Limit
                    of each SPS policy which was in line with the provisions of the policy. As from
                    20 November 2006, therefore, the actions Income had taken to prevent the
                    plaintiffs from having access to the online application system were
                    contractually permitted. Income was thereafter no longer in breach of
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    I will deal with the question of the
                    consequences of Income’s breach of contract between 20 October 2006
                    and 20 November 2006 later in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Good faith and implied terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    This part of the plaintiffs’ claim is
                    based on the legal position that the insurance contract is a contract which is
                    based upon the principle of utmost good faith or <em>uberrimae
                        fidei</em>. They say that the SPS policies imposed duties of good
                    faith on Income and that Income acted in breach of those duties when it
                    suspended the insurance facilities extended to the schools.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    It is established insurance law that the
                    duty of good faith which is expressly stated in s 17 of the Marine Insurance Act
                    (Cap 387, 1994 Rev Ed) (which is the Singapore enactment of the English Marine
                    Insurance Act 1906) is applicable to all contracts of insurance and reinsurance
                    and applies both before a contract is concluded and during the performance of
                    the contract. (See <em>MacGillivray</em> at paras 17-001
                    and 17-002, <em>The Law of Insurance Contracts</em> by
                    Malcolm A Clarke (Informa, 5th Ed, 2006) at 27-1A and <em>Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v Uni-Polaris Insurance Co Ltd; The Star
                        Sea</em> [2003] 1 AC 469 (“<em>The Star
                        Sea</em>”)). In <em>The Star Sea</em>,
                    Lord Hobhouse stated (at [47]) that
                    “utmost good faith is a principle of fair dealing which does not come to
                    an end when the contract has been made”. It is also accepted that this
                    duty binds both insured and insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Generally speaking, in the cases, the duty
                    of good faith in insurance contracts has been explored in connection with the
                    well established duty of the assured to disclose material facts when obtaining
                    the insurance and to refrain from making untrue statements during negotiations.
                    As far as the insurer is concerned, there has been little practical
                    implementation of the duty of good faith in the performance of the contract and
                    the main situation that the cases deal with is the duty of good faith of the
                    insurer when conducting litigation in the name of the insured. The following
                    extract from <em>MacGillivray</em> summarises the position
                    (at 17-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the post-formation period [good faith] continues to affect the
                        insurance, but the content and effect of the duty is flexible and varies
                        depending upon the circumstances. ... [B]oth parties are required to act in
                        good faith towards each other in the performance of the contract, although
                        there are few instances in which the courts have held that the duty applies.
                        One is when a term of the insurance requires the assured to provide the
                        insurer with information in particular circumstances. Another is when a
                        liability insurer exercises his right to conduct his assured’s defence
                        to a claim made by a third party. It is said that the party in question must
                        in such cases act in good faith and with regard to the interests of the
                        other party, although with respect it is difficult to see how the duty of
                        good faith relates to the performance of duties and exercise of rights which
                        have their source in the terms of the contract itself, and for which the
                        contract provides remedies in the event of breach. The irrelevance of the
                        statutory duty is emphasised by the very limited circumstances in which the
                        draconian and often disproportionately severe right of avoidance can be
                        exercised. It is available only in cases when the breach of duty occasions
                        such serious prejudice to the innocent party that it permits him to
                        terminate the insurance contract prospectively under the law of contract.
                        Such cases will be extremely rare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    As stated by <em>MacGillivray</em>, when one party to an insurance contract breaches
                    the duty of good faith, the remedy available to the innocent party is to rescind
                    or avoid the contract. This proposition is also supported by the cases of
                        <em>Banque Keyser Ullmann S.A. v Skandia (U.K.) Insurance Co.
                        Ltd. And Others</em> [1989] 3 WLR 25 (“<em>Banque Keyser</em>”), <em>Aldrich and Ors v
                        Norwich Union</em> [2000] Lloyd’s Rep I.R. 1 and <em>Banque Financiere de la Cite S.A. v Westgate Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [1991] 2 AC 249.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The plaintiffs suggest that there is a
                    difference between a breach of the duty of utmost good faith under s 17 of the
                    Marine Insurance Act and a breach of the contractual obligation of good faith.
                    They recognise that in <em>The Star Sea</em>, both counsel
                    accepted that there would be no remedy in damages for any want of good faith.
                    However, they quote the judgment of Lord Hobhouse in that case and contend that
                    there can be a contractual duty of good faith for which the remedy in case of
                    breach would be damages. Lord Hobhouse said at [49] to [50]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    Thirdly, both counsel accept and assert that the
                            conclusion of the Court of Appeal in the <em>Banque
                                Keyser</em> case [1990] 1 QB 665 is good law and
                            that there is no remedy in damages for any want of good faith. Counsel
                            also drew this conclusion from the second half of section 17 –
                            “may be avoided by the other party”. The sole remedy, they
                            submitted was avoidance. It follows from this that the principle relied
                            upon by the defendants is not an implied term but is a principle of law
                            which is sufficient to support a right to avoid the contract of
                            insurance retrospectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    Having a contractual obligation of good faith in
                            the performance of the contract presents no conceptual difficulty in
                            itself. Such an obligation can arise from an implied or inferred
                            contractual term. It is commonly the subject of an express term in
                            certain types of contract such as partnership contracts. Once parties
                            are in a contractual relationship, the source of their obligations the
                            one to the other is the contract (although the contract is not
                            necessarily exclusive and the relationship which comes into existence
                            may of itself give rise to other liabilities, for example liabilities in
                            tort). The primary remedy for breach of contract is damages. But the
                            consequences of breach of contract are not confined to this.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    It is apparent, however, from the above
                    extract, that Lord Hobhouse recognised that if the duty of good faith was the
                    duty that was implied into the contract because it was an insurance contract and
                    such a duty is attached to insurance contracts, then the only remedy for breach
                    would be avoidance of the contract. When he was dealing with the remedy of
                    damages, he was dealing with it in the context of a good faith obligation which
                    was part of the contract by reason of an express or an implied term. In this
                    case, there is no express obligation of good faith in the SPS policies. Can
                    there be an implied obligation to that effect? The plaintiffs did not put
                    forward any basis on which I should imply a contractual obligation of good faith
                    into the SPS policies which was separate from the good faith obligation implied
                    by insurance law. Quite apart from that, there is a serious obstacle in the
                    plaintiffs’ way and that is the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Ng Giap
                    Hon</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    In <em>Ng Giap
                    Hon</em>, the eponymous plaintiff, Mr Ng, who was a remisier with the
                    defendant (“Westcomb”), argued that there was an implied duty of
                    good faith between him and Westcomb as between agent and principal, and it was
                    an implied term of the agency agreement that Westcomb would not do anything to
                    prevent Mr Ng from earning his commission (“the First Implied
                    Term”). Alternatively, Mr Ng sought to argue that good faith was a
                    term implied in fact (“the Second Implied Term”). The Court of
                    Appeal held that it would not endorse an implied duty of faith in the Singapore
                    context. Headnotes (4) and (5) of the report contain the basis of this holding.
                    They state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The First Implied Term was based on the broader
                            category of “terms implied in law”. However, such a term
                            could <em>not</em> be implied. In the first
                            instance, caution would be required as such terms would be based on
                            broader policy considerations and would also entail implying the same
                            term in the future for all contracts of the same type.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Further, the content of such a term involved the
                            doctrine of good faith, which was a fledgling doctrine in English and
                            Singapore contract law and required much clarification, even on a
                            theoretical level. There were differing views as to what the doctrine
                            meant and how it was to be applied. Moreover, the case law appeared to
                            be in a state of flux. For instance, two leading authors were of the
                            view that good faith was inherent in <em>all</em>
                            aspects of the law of contract and that there was therefore no reason
                            for any term concerning good faith to be implied into a contract. Such a
                            term had to be justified by reference to the particular circumstances of
                            each case and not by a general principle. Therefore, until the
                            theoretical foundations and structure of the doctrine were settled, the
                            court would not endorse an implied duty of good faith in the Singapore
                            context. Accordingly, the First Implied Term should not be implied into
                            the Agency Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    The decision in <em>Ng Giap
                        Hon</em> was endorsed in the subsequent Court of Appeal case of
                        <em>Chua Choon Cheng v Allgreen Properties Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724. At [83]
                    of that judgment, the court observed that the common law does not recognise a
                    principle of good faith, in the sense of fair dealing, to be of general
                    application. <em>Ng Giap Hon</em> also dealt with a
                    “Second Implied Term” which was based on the category of
                    “terms implied in fact” and observed that a term could only be
                    implied in fact if it was necessary to satisfy the “business
                    efficacy” test or the “officious bystander” test. The
                    plaintiffs have not shown me how either of those tests are met in the
                    circumstances of the SPS policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Thus, in relation to the SPS policies, the
                    duty of good faith is that which arises in connection with all insurance
                    contracts and not a duty of good faith that is particular to these contracts.
                    The plaintiffs’ position is that the duty of good faith required Income to
                    consider applications when they were made under the SPS policies,
                    notwithstanding Income’s right under cl 7 of the same to reject
                    applications. By its act of suspending the insurance facilities, Income had
                    deprived the plaintiffs of their right to even submit applications for
                    Income’s consideration. The plaintiffs also cited an American case,
                        <em>Spindle v Travelers Ins Co</em> 136 Cal Rptr 404
                        (“<em>Spindle</em>”) which held that the
                    right of the insurer to terminate the insurance in accordance with its terms is
                    not absolute and may be limited by the doctrine of good faith. They said that
                    the doctrine was used to prevent cancellation by the insurer if the effect was
                    to deprive the insured of his bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    The usefulness of <em>Spindle</em> as an authority which assists the plaintiffs is,
                    however, limited by the fact that the court there relied on authorities for the
                    proposition that in American contract law, there is an implied covenant of good
                    faith and fair dealing in every contract which requires that neither party would
                    do anything which would injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of
                    the agreement and that this principle applied to insurance policies (at p 6). As
                    I have stated, there is no such implied covenant in either SPS
                policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    The cases show that the content of the
                    insurers’ duty of good faith is likely to be very limited. Dealing with
                    the duty of good faith in insurance contracts governed by English law, in
                        <em>KS Merc-Scandia XXXXII v Lloyd’s
                        Underwriters</em> [2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 563, the
                    English Court of Appeal held that the assured’s post-contractual duties
                    were governed primarily by the policy. It should be noted that the main question
                    in the case was whether the insurers were entitled to avoid the policy because
                    of an alleged breach of the duty of good faith on the part of the assured which
                    breach took place after the contract had been concluded. Longmore LJ who
                    delivered the main judgment dealt with the development of the law of
                    post-contract good faith and set out the situations in which such a duty arose.
                    He identified these as follows (at [22]
                    to [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_195-p2_a"></a>(a)     a duty of good faith arises when
                        the assured (or the insurer) seeks to vary the contractual
                    risk;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_195-p2_b"></a>(b)     a duty of
                        good faith exists when the insured seeks to renew the contract of
                        insurance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_195-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        requirement that an insurer hold the insured covered in certain
                        circumstances requires the exercise of good faith by the
                    insured;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_195-p2_d"></a>(d)     if the
                        insurer has a right to information by virtue of an express or implied term,
                        there may be a duty of good faith in the giving of such information;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_195-p2_e"></a>(e)     other
                        situations may arise under the liability policies, particularly, if the
                        insurers decide to take over the insured’s defence to a
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In only two of the categories identified
                    is the insurer mentioned as a party that owes the good faith obligation. The
                    facts of this case do not fall into any of the categories in which
                    Longmore LJ found that the post-contractual duty of good faith might
                    exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In a case dealing with the insurer’s
                    right of cancellation, <em>C T Bowring Reinsurance Ltd v M.R.
                        Baxter (The “M. Vatan” and “M.
                        Ceyhan”)</em> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 416, the
                    court had to construe a clause in a reinsurance policy which gave the reinsurer
                    the right to cancel the cover. The clause provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.1  Cover hereunder in respect of the risks of war
                            ... may be cancelled by either the Underwriters or the Assured giving 7
                            days notice ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hirst J (at p 422) construed the clause as
                    giving to each party an unqualified right to cancel. He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So far as clause 14.1 is concerned, while it is undoubtedly correct that
                        cancellation by notice will often occur in the context envisaged by Mr.
                        Steel, viz: where new circumstances lead to a cancellation followed by
                        prompt reinstatement on re-negotiated terms, I am quite unable to construe
                        this sub-clause as being limited to such circumstances. It seems to me to
                        give each party a completely general and unqualified right to cancel on the
                        appropriate notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Turning back to the SPS policies, if the
                    wording of cl 6.3 thereof is examined it says expressly that Income is to
                    have the right “at any time” and at its “absolute
                    discretion” to withdraw the available balance of Maximum Insurable Limit
                    for new applications for insurance cover “by giving written
                    notice”. It appears to me that this gives Income the unqualified right in
                    any circumstance whatsoever to refuse to entertain new applications and thereby
                    withdraw the Maximum Insurable Limit as long as it gives written notice to the
                    PEO as required by the clause. This is an unfettered right. In the face of such
                    an explicitly and clearly worded power, it is not possible for me to impose any
                    restriction on such power by implying that it is subject to a duty of good faith
                    on the part of the insurer, Income. As discussed in the foregoing paragraphs,
                    the authorities so far have given limited effect to the insurers’
                    continuing duty of good faith after conclusion of the contract and there is no
                    precedent for the type of obligation that the plaintiffs seek to persuade me to
                    impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Further, it is clear that the imposition of
                    such a duty of good faith would not avail the plaintiffs because even if I held
                    that it applied and that it had been breached, the plaintiffs’ only remedy
                    would be to rescind the SPS policies. That is not the remedy that plaintiffs
                    seek by this action. They are claiming substantial damages. The authorities
                    cited above (at <a href="#p1_188">[188]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_189">[189]</a>), however, establish that such
                    damages are not recoverable for breach of the duty of good faith contained in
                    insurance contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    In my judgment, the plaintiffs cannot
                    establish any duty of good faith on the part of Income that had to be adhered to
                    by Income in deciding whether or not to exercise its rights under either
                    cl 6.3 or cl 7 of the SPS policies. The nomenclature used in relation
                    to the contracts between the first plaintiff and Income (which contracts I have
                    called here “SPS policies”) should not confuse the issue. These
                    contracts were not actual insurance cover or insurance policies in substance.
                    That cover took the form of individual insurance policies issued to the students
                    and once issued such policies could not be cancelled. The SPS policies were
                    essentially insurance facilities made available to the plaintiffs in accordance
                    with their terms and these terms included the right to reduce or withdraw the
                    Maximum Insurable Limit and to reject applications for the student insurance
                    policies either on a case by case basis or collectively. The SPS policies did
                    not contain any obligation on Income to exercise its right to decline further
                    coverage of students in the interests of the schools. Contractually, this right
                    existed for the benefit of Income and not for the benefit of the schools and was
                    not modified by any good faith requirement imposed by law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inducement of breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    The next basis on which the plaintiffs put
                    their claim is the assertion that Income wrongfully and recklessly induced and
                    procured the breach by CASE of its contractual obligations to the plaintiffs. As
                    I have found above that there was no breach of CASE’s contractual
                    obligations to the plaintiffs, this allegation must also fall. In any event, I
                    am not persuaded that the plaintiffs would have been able to make out a case on
                    this basis because for them to succeed, they would have to show that there was
                    an inducement by Income on CASE to breach its contract with the plaintiffs. The
                    evidence does not establish such an inducement. What Income did was to
                    communicate information to CASE regarding its decision to suspend its facilities
                    to the schools and mere communication of information is not an inducement giving
                    rise to liability for procurement of breach of contract. For inducement to
                    exist, there must be some element of pressure, persuasion or procurement (see
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2010 para 24-40). I find that the evidence in the case
                    does not show any element of pressure, persuasion or procurement on the part of
                    Income directed towards CASE’s contractual relations with the first
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Negligence and duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    The plaintiffs, in their closing
                    submissions, said that they were relying on negligence as a subsidiary cause of
                    action. If the court ruled in their favour in respect of their principal
                    arguments then there would be no need to delve into the analysis of this cause
                    of action. The plaintiffs did not make any further submissions on how this cause
                    of action arose. I am therefore at somewhat of a loss as to how to deal with
                    this subsidiary cause of action. In relation to the plaintiffs’ case
                    against CASE, I set out the test that is applicable to determine whether one
                    party owes another a duty of care. I also observed at [160] that a contract between parties can
                    create the proximity required for an action in negligence if it creates the
                    duties of care relied on by one of the parties. If it does not, the contract in
                    itself may not be sufficient to constitute proximity between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    In this instance, the duty that the
                    plaintiffs say Income owed them was a duty to act reasonably in administering
                    the SPS policies so as not to cause loss or damage to the plaintiffs. There is
                    nothing in the policies themselves that expressly or impliedly create such a
                    duty. In fact, such a duty would conflict with the express rights given to
                    Income to unilaterally withdraw the Maximum Insurable Limits. Further, there is
                    no recognised doctrine in contract law that parties have to exercise their
                    contractual rights reasonably. It was for that reason that the plaintiffs gave
                    me lengthy submissions on why the duty of good faith in insurance contracts
                    imposed an obligation on Income to act fairly in deciding whether or not to
                    suspend the policies. As that argument has failed, I see no basis on which to
                    impose on Income any tortious duty of the kind that the plaintiffs pleaded.
                    There is also no case authority for the proposition that the insurer owes a duty
                    of care to the insured to act reasonably in administering the policy or
                    insurance facility. The case in negligence is therefore a non-starter, something
                    that the plaintiffs obviously recognised when they chose not to make detailed
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damages for breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    I have found that Income was in breach of
                    contract when it suspended the insurance facilities on 20 October 2006
                    without giving notice to the schools. This breach ended on 20 November 2006
                    when the requisite notice was given. The question arises as to what damages the
                    first plaintiff, who was legally the counter party to the SPS policies, is
                    entitled to recover in respect of such breach. I am considering the position of
                    the first plaintiff only because the first plaintiff was the owner of the
                    schools at the material time <em>ie</em> during the period
                    of breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The plaintiffs’ arguments on damages
                    were premised on the basis that Income’s breach of contract caused CASE to
                    suspend the schools’ membership in CaseTrust and that this resulted in
                    loss of fees when students withdrew from their courses and also in loss of
                    reputation because of the publicity given to the suspension by CASE. Neither of
                    these events was a consequence of the breach with which I am concerned. No one,
                    not even the schools, was aware that the insurance facilities were suspended on
                    20 October 2006 and no students withdrew because of that. The CaseTrust
                    membership was not suspended until 20 November 2006 and it followed
                    Income’s notification on 17 November 2006 that the SPS facilities
                    would be suspended. The CaseTrust suspension therefore had nothing to do with
                    Income’s earlier breach and by the time it came into existence, that
                    earlier breach had been cured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Accordingly, there is no evidence of any
                    substantial damages suffered by the first plaintiff by reason of the suspension
                    on 20 October 2006. In the circumstances, I can only award the first
                    plaintiff nominal damages of $100.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    For the reasons given above, the
                    plaintiffs’ claim against CASE is dismissed with costs. In respect of
                    their claim against Income, I give judgment to the first plaintiff for damages
                    of $100. As the plaintiffs have been largely unsuccessful in their claim against
                    Income, I will hear the parties on costs.</p>
