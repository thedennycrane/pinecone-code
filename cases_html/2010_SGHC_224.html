<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, SHC Capital Limited
                    (“SHC”), and the defendant, NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative
                    Limited (“NTUC”) are insurance companies, which offer, <em>inter alia</em>, workmen’s compensation insurance. The
                    present application was brought by SHC for a declaration that NTUC is liable in
                    respect of a payout made pursuant to a workmen’s compensation
                    policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 22 April 2005, an industrial accident
                    involving a workman occurred at 33 Tuas Crescent, the premises
                    (“premises”) belonging to and occupied by Pan-United Concrete Pte
                    Ltd (“Pan-United”). It is not disputed that Pan-United had engaged
                    Simei Engineering &amp; Trading (“Simei”) as its main contractor,
                    who in turn engaged EIN Engineering and Construction (“EIN”) as
                    its sub-contractor for a project involving the collection of several dismantled
                    structures from another site and delivery of these structures to the premises.
                    Simei also engaged Hup Hin Trading Co Pte Ltd (“Hup Hin”) to
                    supply a mobile crane and an operator to lift the structures. Hup Hin in turn
                    arranged for Hock Swee Seng Construction and Transportation (“Hock
                    Swee”) to supply a mobile crane and a crane operator (one Ng Kia Soong)
                    to operate the crane for the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Omar Bin Hoydeen (“Omar”), one of
                    the workmen employed by EIN to perform the work of a qualified rigger and
                    signalman for the project, was seriously injured when he was struck by the metal
                    chains attached to the boom of the mobile crane operated by Ng Kia Soong at the
                    material time. Omar subsequently commenced an action, Suit 527 of 2006, in the
                    tort of negligence to claim damages for his personal injuries from
                    (a) Pan-United as the occupier of the premises; (b) EIN as his
                    employer; (c) Simei as the main contractor; and (d) Hock Swee as the
                    owner and operator of the mobile crane involved in the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 10 July 2007, interlocutory judgment was
                    entered by consent against the defendants in Suit 527 of 2006 for 90% of
                    total liability, with damages to be assessed. The apportionment of liability
                    vis-à-vis the various parties were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Damages were thereafter assessed. EIN and Simei’s liabilities in
                    total amounted to $317,664.70, which was paid by SHC. However, SHC made no
                    apportionment between EIN’s and Simei’s respective liabilities
                    although Omar was Ein’s employee and not Simei’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The insurance policies </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 1 June 2004, Pan-United took out a
                    Workmen’s Compensation Policy with NTUC (“NTUC Policy”),
                    covering the period from 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2005. The initial
                    coverage provided by the NTUC policy was limited only to “<em><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Pan-United Corporation Limited and Subsidiaries &amp;/or
                        Related Companies</font></em><em>F.T.R.R.&amp; I</em>”. The NTUC policy insured
                    Pan-United and its subsidiaries against all sums of which they would be liable
                    to pay under statute or common law for claims brought against them by workmen
                    under their employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The NTUC Policy contains a Cross Liability
                    Clause which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>CROSS LIABILITY CLAUSE</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Each of the parties comprising the Insured [Pan-United and its
                        subsidiaries] shall for the purpose of this Policy be considered as a
                        separate and distinct unit and the words “the Insured” shall
                        be considered as applying to each party in the same manner as if a separate
                        Policy had been issued to each of the said parties and the Insurers hereby
                        agree to waive all rights of subrogation or action which they may have or
                        acquire against any of the aforesaid parties arising out of any accident in
                        respect of which any claim is made hereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject otherwise to the terms, conditions and exceptions of this
                        Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following term is also found in the endorsement of the NTUC
                    policy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                        is hereby declared and agreed that the Policy is extended to cover the

                        sub-contractors for which <em>they</em> may be
                        responsible. <em>Provided that the indemnity given is on the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The NTUC Policy coverage was later extended
                        <em>vide</em> an endorsement dated 28 March 2005
                    to include all tiers of sub-contractors engaged by Pan-United and its
                    subsidiaries and related companies. The revised certificate of insurance from
                    NTUC states the following as the “Name of Insured”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PAN-UNITED CORPORATION LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES &amp;/OR RELATED COMPANIES
                        &amp;/OR <b>ALL TIERS OF SUB-CONTRACTORS</b> &amp;/OR
                        THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPALS AS LISTED BELOW F.T.R.R.&amp;I. (Emphasis
                        added.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The new “Name of the Insured”
                    clause should be read with the Cross Liability Clause in the original NTUC
                    Policy in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>CROSS LIABILITY CLAUSE</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Each of the parties comprising the Insured [Pan-United and all tiers of
                        its sub-contractors, <em>i.e</em>. Simei and EIN] shall
                        for the purpose of this Policy be considered as a separate and distinct unit
                        and the words “the Insured” shall be considered as applying to
                        each party [<em>i.e</em>. Simei and EIN] in the same
                        manner as if a separate [NTUC] Policy had been issued to each of the said
                        parties [<em>i.e</em>. Simei and EIN] and the Insurers
                        hereby agree to waive all rights of subrogation or action which they may
                        have or acquire against any of the aforesaid parties arising out of any
                        accident in respect of which any claim is made hereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject otherwise to the terms, conditions and exceptions of this
                        Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed in the present application by SHC that EIN and
                    Simei fall within the class of insured named and identified in the NTUC policy
                    as “<em>all tiers of sub-contractors</em>”
                    since EIN was a second tier sub-contractor and Simei was a first tier
                    sub-contractor of Pan-United for the project. Consequently, by the operation of
                    the Cross Liability Clause, they were deemed as having been separately issued a
                    workmen’s compensation policy by NTUC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Separately, SHC had also underwritten two
                    Workmen’s Compensation policies (“SHC Policies”) to insure
                    EIN for the period from 15 April 2005 to 14 April 2006 and Simei for
                    the period from 22 October 2004 to 21 October 2005 against all sums of
                    which they (<em>i.e</em>. EIN and Simei) would be liable to
                    pay under statute or common law for claims brought against them by workmen under
                    their employment. Both of these policies are annual workmen’s compensation
                    policies with identical terms and conditions. They are not specific policies
                    issued in respect of a particular job or project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The SHC policies each contain a
                    Non-contributory Clause, which excludes liability on SHC’s part if the
                    insured has been insured by any other workmen’s compensation
                    policy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>NON-CONTRIBUTORY CLAUSE (in both
                            SHC Policies)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Warranted that if the Insured [EIN/Simei] is covered under any other
                        Policy for Workmen’s Compensation Insurance, the Company [SHC] will
                        not indemnify the Insured [EIN/Simei] nor be called upon to contribute under
                        this Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed by the parties that the wording of this clause is
                    sufficient to exclude SHC’s liability to indemnify the insured person
                    [EIN/Simei] if it has been double insured.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute between the insurers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Prior to the entry of a consent order upon
                    Omar’s claim against Pan-United, Simei, EIN and Hock Swee on 10 July
                    2007, SHC’s solicitors had written to NTUC on 12 January 2007,
                    requesting them to take over conduct of the defence for Simei and EIN, relying
                    upon the Non-contributory Clause in their respective policies. However, NTUC, by
                    their solicitor’s letter dated 13 February 2007, rejected SHC’s
                    request on the ground that its policy did not cover Simei and EIN. Thus, NTUC
                    only had conduct of Pan-United’s defence while SHC conducted Simei and
                    EIN’s defences. SHC subsequently commenced third party proceedings against
                    NTUC, seeking a court declaration that NTUC shall be fully liable for
                    indemnifying Simei and EIN, or in the alternative, that SHC and NTUC are each
                    liable to indemnify 50% of Simei and EIN’s liabilities. The third party
                    proceedings were subsequently discontinued, without prejudice to the
                    parties’ respective rights and liabilities. After SHC had indemnified
                    Simei and EIN, and NTUC had indemnified Pan-United, SHC commenced the present
                    proceedings, seeking a declaration from the court that NTUC is liable to make a
                    contribution to SHC for either 100% or 50% of the amounts it had already paid
                    out to Simei and EIN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     SHC now makes this application on the ground
                    that (i) the NTUC Policy covered EIN and Simei for the claims of Omar,
                    thereby creating a situation of double insurance; and (ii) that NTUC did
                    not exclude its equitable obligation to make a contribution to SHC in its
                    contract with EIN and Simei. Before going into the merits of SHC’s
                    application, it is essential to first outline the legal principles on double
                    insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on double insurance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Double insurance occurs when an insured person
                    has been insured by two insurers in respect of the same liability: Poh Chu Chai,
                        <em>Principles of Insurance Law</em> (LexisNexis,
                        6<sup>th</sup> ed, 2005) (“<em>Principles of Insurance Law</em>”) at p 1233. <em>Principles of Insurance Law</em> also provides a succinct
                    summary of the legal right of contribution available to an insurer (which has
                    fully compensated an insured person in respect of a particular risk) against the
                    other insurer which has insured the same insured person against the same risk
                    (at p 1243):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a particular risk is insured with two or more insurers and a loss
                        arising from the risk is fully paid for by one insurer, the insurer is
                        entitled to contribution from the other insurers who have not paid. An
                        insurer’s right of contribution is not based on contract but arises
                        from principles of equity, that persons who are liable for the same loss
                        should contribute equally towards the loss…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>American Surety Co of
                        New York v Wrightson</em> (1911) 103 LT 663, Hamilton J
                    remarked that this duty of contribution may be based on general propositions
                    that “contribution is based upon principles of equity that equality is
                    sometimes equity, and that there should be a rateable portion amongst those who
                    have to contribute…” Reference may also be made to <em>Colinvaux’s Law of Insurance</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        8<sup>th</sup> ed, 2006), at p 414, where the
                    author outlined the difference between the insurer’s right of subrogation
                    and contribution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Contribution should be carefully distinguished from subrogation.
                        Since contribution implies more than one contract of insurance, it is only
                        where there are two or more policies involved that there can be any
                        confusion between the two. Subrogation ensures that the assured receives no
                        more than an indemnity: contribution ensures that the insurers do not suffer
                        injustice amongst themselves because of that rule. Unlike a claim for
                        subrogation, a contribution action must be brought in the insurer’s
                        own name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, an insurer may seek to exclude its
                    liability by way of indemnity to its insured or by way of contribution to
                    another insurer, who has insured the same insured person in respect of the same
                    risk. One method of achieving this end is to provide that an insurer is not
                    liable if the policy holder has been insured for the same risk under another
                    policy. Such an exclusion clause has been construed in <em>Bankers &amp; Traders Insurance Co Ltd v National Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [1985] 1 WLR 734, where a car owner allowed a friend to
                    drive his car, and in the course of doing so, the friend injured a third party.
                    The car owner had an insurance policy insuring against any liability to third
                    parties caused by any driver driving his car, with the owner’s consent. In
                    the car owner’s policy, there was a clause which provided that the car
                    driver would be indemnified for third party risks provided that he (<em>i.e</em>. the car driver) was “not entitled to
                    indemnity under any other policy”. On the facts of that case, the friend
                    who was then driving the car also had a policy of insurance which insured him
                    against liability to third parties caused while driving a private car not
                    belonging to him. The third parties brought an action against both insurers
                    claiming payment. The Privy Council (on appeal from the Federal Court of
                    Malaysia) held that by virtue of the exclusion clause in the car owner’s
                    policy, the policy containing an exclusion clause was <em>not on
                        risk at the time of the accident</em>. Therefore, the full burden of
                    the indemnity must be borne by the driver’s insurers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Similarly, in <em>Nanyang
                        Insurance Co Ltd v Commercial Union Assurance Plc</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 441, two insurers had insured the same assured against the risk of
                    accidents in the course of work. In Commercial Union Assurance Plc’s
                    insurance policy, it excluded its liability to indemnify the assured if it had
                    any other policy of indemnity or insurance in respect of the same risk, unless
                    the loss suffered by the assured was higher than the “amount which would
                    be payable under such other indemnity or insurance had this policy not been
                    effected”. The loss sustained by the assured was $63,023.28, which was
                    lower than the upper limit of policy issued by Nanyang Insurance Co Ltd. The
                    court held that the Commercial Union Assurance Plc’s exclusion clause had
                    rendered it not liable. There was no double insurance and Nanyang Insurance was
                    legally obliged to indemnify the assured for 100% of his loss. Thus, although
                    Nanyang Insurance had already limited its liability to no more than its rateable
                    proportion (i.e. 50-50 in the event of double insurance), its rateable
                    proportion clause did not operate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     However when both insurers exclude liability
                    in their respective contracts with the insured person in the event of double
                    insurance, then, the exclusion clauses cancel each other out, with the net
                    effect that both insurers share liability equally as amongst themselves. In
                        <em>Weddell v Road Transport &amp; General Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [1932] 2 KB 563, Rowlatt J said the following while
                    construing two third party motor insurance contracts containing exclusion of
                    liability clauses (at 567-568):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In my judgment it is unreasonable to suppose that it was intended
                        that clauses such as these should cancel each other (by neglecting in each
                        case the proviso in the other policy) with the result that, on the ground in
                        each case that the loss is covered elsewhere, it is covered nowhere. On the
                        contrary, the reasonable construction is to exclude from the category of
                        co-existing cover any cover which is expressed to be itself cancelled by
                        such co-existence, and to hold in such cases that both companies are liable,
                        subject of course in both cases to any rateable contribution proportion
                        clause which there may be…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The declarations sought</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In these proceedings, SHC is seeking the
                    following declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    A declaration that
                            [NTUC’s] Workmen’s Compensation Policy... extends to cover
                            [EIN] and [Simei].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    That [SHC]
                            shall be indemnified by [NTUC] for</p>

                                behalf of [EIN] and [Simei]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   the legal costs and disbursement expended for
                                and on behalf of [EIN] and [Simei]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">amounting to $317,664.70, paid in connection to the claims of the workman
                        [Omar] against [EIN] and [Simei].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Alternatively, a
                            declaration that [SHC] shall be indemnified by [NTUC] for</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    the contribution to damages paid for and on
                                behalf of [EIN] and [Simei]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   the legal costs and disbursement expended for
                                and on behalf of [EIN] and [Simei]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">amounting to $158,853.35... paid in connection to the claims of the
                        workman [Omar] against [EIN] and [Simei].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Before the court, SHC argues that since the
                    “Name of Insured” clause in the NTUC policy includes all tiers of
                    sub-contractors and the effect of the Cross Liability Clause is such that a
                    separate policy has been issued to each insured person, <em>viz</em>, Simei and EIN, Simei and EIN have been insured by NTUC. As
                    Simei and EIN have also been insured by SHC, they have been insured by two
                    different insurers in respect of the same risk. Since SHC has excluded its
                    liability to indemnify Simei or EIN in the event of double insurance in its
                    Non-contributory Clause, SHC could claim a 100% contribution of the $317,664.70
                    which it has paid out to Omar on behalf of Simei and EIN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     NTUC, on the other hand, submits that SHC
                    ought not to be indemnified because the Contingent Liability Clause in the NTUC
                    Policy prevented the NTUC Policy from being on risk in the first place. While
                    NTUC did not dispute that Simei and EIN were the insured and Hock Swee was a
                    second tier sub-contractor of Simei within the meaning of the Contingent
                    Liability Clause, it submits that provisos (a) and (b) (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) were condition precedents to
                    NTUC’s liability to indemnify Simei and EIN. Since Simei and EIN have been
                    double insured, NTUC argues that its NTUC Policy was not on risk by virtue of
                    proviso (a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     SHC’s reply is that the Contingent
                    Liability Clause is simply irrelevant to the present case for the following
                    reasons. First, the main provision in the Contingent Liability Clause served the
                    purpose of enlarging the risk insured. Thus, the effect of the Contingent
                    Liability Clause was that the NTUC Policy was “extended to cover”
                    insured persons against “the Insured’s legal liability in respect
                    of acts of employees of their sub-contractors for which they may be
                    responsible”. Secondly, the “Insured” mentioned in the main
                    provision of the Contingent Liability Clause must cover only Pan-United, because
                    the Contingent Liability Clause is meant to indemnify it against vicarious
                    liability or occupier’s liability for its sub-contractors’ breaches
                    of duty. Thus, the Contingent Liability Clause is irrelevant to the present
                    proceedings because the dispute is over the identity of the party which was
                    legally obligated to indemnify Simei and EIN for their liabilities to Omar.
                    Thirdly, since the main provision is irrelevant, the provisos are therefore
                    inapplicable to exclude NTUC’s liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The present application raises three issues.
                    The first issue is whether Simei and/or EIN have both been double insured. The
                    second issue is whether NTUC has properly excluded its liability to indemnify
                    Simei and/or EIN by its provisos to the Contingent Liability Clause in its
                    policy. The last issue is whether, if NTUC is liable to indemnify Simei and/or
                    EIN under the terms of the NTUC Policy, SHC’s right to seek a contribution
                    or reimbursement has been precluded by its voluntary payment to Simei and/or
                    EIN.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proper construction of the operative clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I begin first by noting that the operative
                    clauses in the NTUC Policy and the SHC Policies provide similar coverage in
                    respect of workmen’s compensation. The operative clauses setting out the
                    coverage in the SHC Policies read (“SHC Operative Clause”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>NOW THIS POLICY WITNESSETH</b> that <em>if any workman in the Insured’s employment shall sustain
                            personal injury by accident or disease caused during the Period of

                            Insured [EIN or Simei] in the Business</em>, the Company will
                        subject to the terms exceptions conditions and warranties, and any
                        memorandum if applicable, contained herein or endorsed hereon (all of which
                        are hereinafter collective referred to as the Terms of the Policy) indemnify
                        the Insured against all sums for which the Insured shall be liable to pay
                        compensation either under the Legislation or at Common Law, and will in
                        addition pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Insured with the written
                        consent of the Company. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The operative clause in the NTUC policy setting out the coverage reads
                    (“NTUC Operative Clause”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>NOW THIS POLICY WITNESSETH</b> that <em>if any workman in the Insured’s employment shall sustain
                            personal injury by accident or disease caused during the Period of

                            of sub-contractors, which includes EIN and Simei] in the
                            Business</em>, the Society will subject to the terms exceptions
                        conditions and warranties, and any memorandum if applicable, contained

                        claims arising out of any one event and will in addition pay all costs and
                        expenses incurred by the Insured with the written consent of the Society.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, it is apparent that the words in the operative clauses of the
                    NTUC and SHC policies cover the same type of risk <em>i.e</em>. the risk of a claim by the insured’s own employee
                    arising from personal injuries sustained in the course of his employment by the
                    insured. Since the NTUC Policy applies to Simei and EIN by virtue of the
                    expansion of coverage to “all tiers” of sub-contractors and the
                    Cross Liability Clause and it is not disputed that Simei and EIN are also
                    insured under the SHC Policies, it is clear that they have been double insured
                    in respect of liability for injuries of <em>their</em>
                    employees. Since the parties have confirmed that Omar is EIN’s employee
                    and not Simei’s employee, both the NTUC Policy and the SHC Policy issued
                    to EIN were on risk insofar as EIN’s liability to Omar was concerned. EIN
                    was therefore double insured. However, as far as Simei’s liability was
                    concerned, neither the NTUC nor the SHC operative clauses applied to render the
                    NTUC policy or the SHC policy issued to Simei on risk because Omar was not a
                    workman in the employment of Simei, unless the insurance coverage to Simei has
                    been separately extended by other clauses in the policy to claims by even
                    non-employees. Unlike the NTUC policy, there is no such extension of coverage to
                    Simei under the SHC policy for claims by a non-employee such as Omar.
                    Unfortunately, this crucial distinction between Simei’s and EIN’s
                    liability to Omar was not drawn in the course of arguments by counsel for both
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proper construction of the Contingent Liability Clause in the
                NTUC Policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the light of the above, NTUC’s
                    argument that its policy is not on risk given that proviso (a) (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) was a condition precedent to
                    the triggering of the coverage in the entire policy (including the NTUC
                    Operative Clause) need only be considered insofar as <em>EIN’s liability</em> is concerned. I am of the view that in
                    order for proviso (a) to the Contingent Liability Clause to have any bite,
                    the main provision in the Contingent Liability Clause must apply to the present
                    case. This is because the words of the proviso limit NTUC’s liability,
                    which is set out by the main provision. In this regard, I first deal with
                    SHC’s argument that the Contingent Liability Clause only insures
                    Pan-United and not Simei or EIN. I am unable to see why the word
                    “insured” in the context of this clause should be so confined,
                    when SHC readily accepts that “insured” in the context of the rest
                    of the policy refers to Pan-United and “all-tiers” of
                    sub-contractors. Words ought to be interpreted as having the same meaning as
                    they have been used elsewhere in the policy: McMeel, <em>The
                        Construction of Contracts: Interpretation, Implication and Rectification
                        (</em>Oxford University Press, 2007) at para 4.16.Thus, I reject
                    this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I am also of the view that the Contingent
                    Liability Clause must be read to provide for an extension of coverage, over and
                    above the coverage already provided by the NTUC Operative Clause since it
                    expressly provides that NTUC’s liability “is extended to”
                    cover the Insured’s liability for the acts of the employees of <em>their sub-contractors</em>. In its submissions, counsel for
                    SHC referred the court to another clause which provides for an extension of the
                    scope of coverage provided by the NTUC Policy:</p>

                        unconnected with his employment which would ordinarily have materially added
                        to the risk of injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The words “is extended to” in this context convey the
                    meaning that the coverage provided by the NTUC Operative Clause is extended
                    beyond injuries to employees in the course of work, to cover employer’s
                    liability for injuries to employees while commuting to and from the work place,
                    and during meal breaks. Similarly, in the context of the Contingent Liability
                    Clause, the words “is extended to” must convey the meaning that
                    the scope of coverage provided by the NTUC Operative Clause has been expanded
                    beyond the employer’s liability for injury to employees in the course of
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Thus, the Contingent Liability Clause which
                    insures insured persons against the “acts of employees of their
                    sub-contractors for which they may be responsible” covers a different
                    scope of liability from that which is covered by the NTUC Operative Clause.
                    While the word “they” is ambiguous in the sense that it is not
                    immediately apparent whether “they” refers to sub-contractors or
                    the Insured, I am of the view that “they” refers to the Insured. I
                    find that the purpose of the Contingent Liability Clause is to expand the
                    coverage afforded to Pan-United, or any other Insured person <em>e.g</em>. EIN and Simei, against liability for breaches of duties by
                    its sub-contractors. It would be absurd for the NTUC Policy to insure an insured
                    person against the acts of their sub-contractors’ employees, for which the
                    sub-contractor and not the insured was responsible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Further, I am also of the view that the main
                    provision in the Contingent Liability Clause should be read as extending
                    NTUC’s cover to an insured person against the risk of its sub-contractor
                    injuring any person, <em>who is not the insured’s own
                        employee</em>. This is because the NTUC Operative Clause would already
                    have covered the insured’s liability to its own employees for injury
                    sustained in the course of work. This must be the construction of the Contingent
                    Liability Clause, because reasonable commercial men would not have seen the need
                    to extend the ambit of coverage via an endorsement, in order to cover
                    substantially the same risk already covered by the NTUC Operative Clause. In
                    this context, I interpret the word “sub-contractors” in the
                    Contingent Liability Clause widely, to include all tiers of sub-contractors. I
                    am of this view because it would make no commercial sense for the Insured to be
                    insured only against liability for the acts of its immediate sub-contractor. One
                    can imagine a case for instance, where Pan-United, the insured, is held liable
                    as occupiers of the premises for injuries to third parties caused by a
                    sub-contractor, three tiers below in the hierarchy of contractual relationships,
                    such as Hock Swee. In such a circumstance, the Contingent Liability Clause must
                    have been intended to apply to provide Pan-United with coverage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The present case is thus distinguishable from
                        <em>Awang bin Dollah v Shung Shing Construction &amp;
                        Engineering Co Ltd</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 746, where the word
                    “sub-contractors” was held to refer only to an immediate
                    sub-contractor. That case concerned a workmen’s compensation policy which
                    insured a contractor against injuries to its employees in the course of
                    employment (similar to that in the SHC Operative Clauses and the NTUC Operative
                    Clause). It was extended by an endorsement to cover “3 General Labourers
                    (Sub-Contractors’ Workers)”. These three workers were not
                    identified. The Court of Appeal held at [55] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Assuming that it was usual and convenient for the main contractor to
                        take out a single policy covering all contractors including subcontractors
                        and sub-subcontractors, it seems to us extremely odd that, in such a major
                        contract as this, only three "General Labourers (Sub-Contractors' workers)"
                        were covered by the policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal also held that since there was nothing in the
                    context of the policy which indicates that a broad construction of the word
                    “sub-contractors” should be adopted to include all tiers of
                    sub-contractors below, a narrower construction should be adopted. In the present
                    case, given that the NTUC Policy has been extended to cover “all
                    tiers” of sub-contractors, it would be incongruent to read the Contingent
                    Liability Clause narrowly. I find that given the internal context, and the clear
                    and unambiguous external context, “sub-contractors” in
                    NTUC’s Contingent Liability Clause ought to be read widely to include all
                    tiers of sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     While it appears at first blush strange to
                    construe a workmen’s policy to extend beyond the mere provision of
                    coverage for the insured’s liability for injury to its own employees,
                    attempts to enlarge the insured risk covered by workmen’s compensation
                    policies are not uncommon. Workmen’s compensation insurance policies are
                    frequently extended in an attempt (whether successful or otherwise) to provide
                    comprehensive coverage to all contractors working on a worksite to include
                    claims against them (not only from their own employees but from other workmen at
                    the worksite) arising from injuries caused by acts of employees of their
                    sub-contractors or their sub-sub-contractors for which the insured contractors
                    may be held responsible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having construed the Contingent Liability
                    Clause in this manner, it becomes clear that it is inapplicable to EIN. Thus,
                    the provisos cannot possibly apply to exclude NTUC’s liability. This is
                    because EIN simply did not have a sub-contractor, whose employee had injured
                    Omar, so as to trigger the operation of the main provision in NTUC’s
                    Contingent Liability Clause in the first place. In fact, Omar was injured by an
                    employee of Hock Swee, a sub-sub-contractor of Simei (and not of EIN). Now that
                    the Contingent Liability Clause is not applicable for the NTUC policy pertaining
                    to EIN as the insured, EIN is therefore double insured by both NTUC and SHC with
                    respect to Omar’s injuries. Thus, given that SHC’s policy contained
                    a Non-contributory Clause, SHC’s policy is not on risk insofar as
                    EIN’s liability to its employee, Omar, is concerned. Since the NTUC Policy
                    did not also have an exclusion clause in the event of double insurance, NTUC is
                    100% liable to provide an indemnity to EIN.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As far as Simei is concerned, although the
                    NTUC Operative Clause and SHC Operative Clause do not extend any insurance
                    coverage for Simei’s liability in relation to personal injuries sustained
                    by a non-employee of Simei (such as Omar), the Contingent Liability Clause in
                    the NTUC policy has however extended coverage to Simei for its liability to
                    claims made by a non-employee. Thus, although Hock Swee is factually
                    Simei’s sub-sub-contractor, the main provision in NTUC’s Contingent
                    Liability Clause should apply if Simei is found liable to Omar for Hock
                    Swee’s employees’ acts. In the present case, because consent
                    judgment was entered against Simei for the acts of Ng Kia Soong, an employee of
                    Hock Swee, it is clear that Simei is held legally responsible by way of the
                    consent judgment for the acts of Ng Kia Soong. It is therefore necessary to
                    consider the applicability of the provisos to the Contingent Liability Clause to
                    Simei.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicability of provisos in the Contingent Liability Clause to
                Simei</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Provisos (a) and (b) (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) are exclusion clauses which limit
                    NTUC’s liability to indemnify the insured person under the Contingent
                    Liability Clause. Proviso (a) provides that an indemnity is given on the
                    condition that the liability has not been covered by an insurance of the
                    sub-contractors. In the present context, proviso (a) would apply if the
                    sub-contractor (Hock Swee) has been insured against the risk of its employee (Ng
                    Kia Soong) injuring a third party like Omar. Since no evidence was adduced
                    before the court indicating that Hock Swee had taken out any such policy to that
                    effect, I am of the view that proviso (a) to the Contingent Liability Clause has
                    not been triggered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Since proviso (a) is inapplicable,
                        <em>a fortiori</em>, proviso (b) is inapplicable.
                    Proviso (b) provides that where the insured’s sub-contractor has been
                    covered by more specific insurance, NTUC’s liability to indemnify the
                    insured for accidents caused by employees of the insured’s subcontractors
                    is limited only to the any excess beyond the limit insured under the
                    subcontractor’s more specific insurance policy. There is no evidence that
                    Hock Swee is covered by more specific insurance. Therefore both provisos to the
                    Contingent Liability Clause are inapplicable on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Since the Contingent Liability Clause covers
                    Simei and the provisos do not operate, the NTUC Policy was on risk and NTUC was
                    therefore liable to indemnify Simei against its liability for the personal
                    injuries sustained by Omar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether SHC may maintain a claim for reimbursement from NTUC although
                it has paid out despite being under no legal obligation to do so </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Having decided that NTUC is legally obliged to
                    provide both EIN and Simei a full indemnity in respect of their liabilities to
                    Omar, the next issue is whether SHC, who paid out to Simei and EIN when it was
                    under no legal obligation to do so, may claim a contribution or reimbursement
                    from NTUC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The right of contribution exists as between
                    co-insurers who have insured the same assured against the same risk, in respect
                    of the same subject matter: <em>MacGillivray on Insurance Law
                        Relating to All Risks Other Than Marine</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        11<sup>th</sup> ed, 2008) at para 23-001
                        (“<em>MacGillivray</em>”). Thus, when two
                    insurers are liable for the same loss, the insurer called upon to make payment
                    may have the right to seek payment from the other insurer: <em>MacGillivray</em> at para 23-032. The concept of contribution is
                    similar to another concept known as reimbursement, save for a slight difference.
                    In the case of contribution, it is essential that both the plaintiff and
                    defendant are jointly and/or severally liable to the same third party in respect
                    of the same debt: see <em>Moule v Garrett</em> (1871-1872)
                    LR 7 Ex 101 at 104; <em>Bonner v Tottenham and Edmonton
                        Permanent Investment Building Society</em> [1899] 1 QB 161

                    para 1.06. In the case of reimbursement, the plaintiff and defendant do not
                    need to be jointly and/or severally liable to the third party in respect of the
                    same debt. It would suffice if the plaintiff is compellable or compelled under
                    the law or by necessity to discharge the defendant’s debt and was not
                    acting officiously in so doing: <em>Halsbury’s Laws of

                        and Jones</em>”) at para 15-001 which states that the
                    plaintiff must have been compelled by law to make a payment in order to obtain
                    reimbursement. An example of a claim in reimbursement is where a surety who was
                    called upon to pay a sum of money on the default of the principal debtor or some
                    other person who is principally liable makes a claim against the principal for a
                    full indemnity: <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em>,
                    vol 40(1) at para 65. Another example may be found in <em>Exall v Partridge</em> (1799) 8 TR 308, where the
                    claimants’ goods which were on land leased to the defendants, were seized
                    by the landlords in distress of rent. The claimant, having paid rent to obtain
                    the release of goods, successfully obtained recoupment (another word for
                    reimbursement) from the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Apart from that distinction, in substance, the
                    two concepts are similar. In <em>Mitchell</em>, the author
                    stated that (at para 1.03):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Broadly speaking, English law divides claims of this sort into two types:
                        claims for contribution and claims for reimbursement. Claims for
                        reimbursement lie when the liabilities owed by the claimant and the
                        defendant to the third party are such that the claimant is entitled to shift
                        the whole burden of paying the third party onto the defendant. Claims for
                        contribution lie where the claimant and the defendant must share the burden
                        of paying the third party, with the result that the claimant can shift only
                        part of this burden onto the defendant. However, there is no substantial
                        difference in principle between contribution claims and reimbursement
                        claims, as the basic components of each type of claim are the same, and it
                        is only the quantum of the claimant’s entitlement which distinguishes
                        them. Consistently with this, the courts have a discretion to make 100 per
                        cent contribution awards which are essentially identical with reimbursement
                        awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Later, at para 1.20, the author said the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be reiterated here that although English lawyers are accustomed
                        to think of contribution and reimbursement as distinct remedies, whose award
                        is governed by separate sets of rules, in reality the principles which
                        underlie contribution and reimbursement awards are the same. The only
                        practical difference between contribution and reimbursement claims is that a
                        claimant bringing an action for reimbursement invariably seeks to recover
                        the whole of his payment from the defendant, while a claimant bringing a
                        contribution action may seek to recover some smaller proportion of his
                        payment. But there is no reason in principle why a claimant should not
                        recover the whole of his payment in a contribution action. To put this in
                        another way, the courts are quite able to make 100 per cent contribution
                        awards if they think this appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The remedies of contribution or reimbursement
                    are restitutionary in nature, and are aimed at preventing unjust enrichment of a
                    defendant who has been conferred a benefit by the plaintiff’s payment:
                        <em>Grupos Torras SA v Al-Sabah (No 5)</em> [2001]
                    Lloyd’s Rep Bank 36 at 64. Thus, the remedy of contribution or
                    reimbursement would prevent unjust enrichment to a defendant, whose liability
                    has been extinguished <em>pro tanto</em> by the
                    claimant’s payment to a creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I pause to make the observation that it
                    appears that the law may countenance a claim for contribution even where the
                    plaintiff and defendant were under no common liability to be sued. In <em>Bonner</em>, (cited with approval in <em>FBI
                        Foods Ltd – Aliments FBI Ltee v Glassner</em> 86 BCLR
                    (3d) 136 (“<em>FBI Foods</em>”);
                        <em>Friend v Brooker</em> [2009] HCA 21 at [44];
                        <em>Whitham v Bullock</em> [1939] 2 KB 81) Vaugham
                    Williams LJ remarked (at 174) that there:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">is a common law principle of liability, and also a principle of liability
                        in equity, and these two principles differ. The common law principle
                        requires a common liability to be sued for that which the plaintiff had to
                        pay, and an interest of the defendant in the payment in the sense that he
                        gets the benefit of the payment, either entirely, as in the case of the
                        assignee of a lease, or pro tanto, as in the case of a surety who has paid,
                        and has his action for contribution against his co-surety. <em>The principle in equity seems wide enough to include cases in
                            which there is community of interest in the subject-matter to which the
                            burden is attached, which has been enforced against the plaintiff alone,
                            coupled with benefit to the defendant, even though there is no common
                            liability to be sued</em>. In such a case it seems to me a
                        plaintiff may recover in equity, although there is no common liability to be
                        sued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in <em>FBI Foods</em>, Dillon J
                    remarked that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The equitable principle requires that the burden borne by one for the
                        benefit of others associated with him in interest, whether borne because of
                        election by a plaintiff of choice of parties or by requirement of law as to
                        parties to actions, be shared equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Whitham v Bullock</em>, the English Court
                    of Appeal referred to the above passage in <em>Bonner</em>
                    in a case where the lessee of land had assigned the lease as to part of the land
                    to X and part to Y. The result was that the lessor could distrain against either
                    X or Y for the whole of the rent but could sue to recover from each only the
                    proportionate part of the rent. Because Y failed to pay its proportion under
                    threat of distraint by the lessor, X paid the whole of the rent and then sought
                    a contribution from Y. Clauson LJ held that X had an equity to recover
                    contribution from Y because although X was not liable to be sued directly for
                    all of the rent, the equity of X arose from payment under stress of legal
                    process. Also, X had paid out in order not to lose its chattels which were on
                    the premises. Clauson J held that there was sufficient "community of
                    interest" in the two plots of the leased land. Thus, X’s claim against Y
                    for a contribution succeeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the present case, SHC is seeking a
                    declaration that it is entitled to a reimbursement, and in the alternative,
                    contribution. I have concluded above that SHC’s policy is not on risk
                    insofar as EIN’s and Simei’s liabilities to Omar were concerned. SHC
                    is therefore precluded from pursuing a claim for contribution from NTUC for
                    making payment to EIN and Simei when SHC’s own policy was never at risk.
                    It is not necessary for the present application to consider whether SHC and NTUC
                    share sufficient “community of interest”, because the parties did
                    not proceed on that point. As stated in Friedmann, <em>Double
                        Insurance and Payment of Another’s Debt</em> (1993) 103 LQR
                    51 at p 53,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a number of persons are potentially liable to the plaintiff, some of
                        them may have a strong interest in settling the claim. There is also a
                        public interest in facilitating settlement. However, a serious difficulty
                        arises if it transpires that the party who satisfied the plaintiffs claim
                        was not actually liable to him. In such a case the rules as to adjustment
                            [<em>i.e</em>. contribution] among multiple debtors
                        are inapplicable, since the payor was not a “debtor”. The
                        issue is then channelled to the general problem of payment of
                        another’s debt... and the reasonable solution is to allow the payor to
                        recover from the real debtors. English law is not, however, very benevolent
                        to a party who without being requested confers a benefit upon another, and
                        since the payor did not act under legal compulsion, he may well be branded
                        as “volunteer”...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The resolution of this application for
                    reimbursement therefore turns on the issue of whether SHC indemnified Simei and
                    EIN under legal compulsion (or factual necessity). The general rule is that
                    since equity does not assist a volunteer, no right of contribution or
                    reimbursement exists at law if a claimant has paid out to a creditor in excess
                    of its legal liability voluntarily, <em>i.e</em>., in the
                    absence of compulsion by law, which discharged the defendant’s legal
                    liability: see <em>Legal &amp; General Assurance Society v Drake
                        Insurance Co Ltd</em> [1992] 1 All ER 283 (“<em>Legal &amp; General Assurance</em>”); <em>Moule v Garrett</em> (1872) LR 7 Ex 101 at 104 and
                        <em>Goff and Jones</em> at para 15-001. In
                        <em>Legal &amp; General Assurance</em>, two motor
                    insurers insured a vehicle owner against injuries caused to third parties by
                    persons driving his car with his consent. Both insurance policies contained a
                    clause limiting liability to its rateable proportion. The assured made a claim
                    against one insurer. The insurer, having ascertained that its policy covered the
                    same loss as that covered by the other insurer, paid out in full anyway and
                    subsequently sought to recover a 50% contribution. The English Court of Appeal
                    held that in paying in excess of its legal obligation, the paying insurer was
                    acting as a volunteer. The English Court of Appeal also held that although under
                    s 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c 52) (UK), an insurer was not
                    allowed to plead any policy defence to a claim by the third party victim,
                    s 151(7) of the same Act provided the paying insurer recourse against the
                    assured in respect of any sum paid in excess of its liability under its policy.
                    Since the paying insurer failed to exercise its right of recourse against the
                    assured, the English Court of Appeal held that he was a volunteer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     
          <em>Legal and General
                        Assurance</em> has been subject to much criticism, on the ground that
                    it is unclear why a theoretical right of recourse against the assured which may
                    prove to be worthless as a matter of fact, ought to prevent the paying insurer
                    from exercising its right of recourse: <em>Colinvaux</em>
                    at p 421 - 422. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that there is much to
                    be said for encouraging insurers to pay out expeditiously, leaving disputes on
                    liability between different insurers to be resolved at a later date, without the
                    paying insurer’s right of recourse being removed on the ground that he had
                    acted as a volunteer: see Friedmann, <em>Double Insurance and
                        Payment of Another’s Debt</em> (1993) 103 LQR 51. However,
                    in <em>Legal &amp; General Assurance</em> at p 897,
                    Lloyd LJ said the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel] argued that the plaintiffs were acting very properly in not
                        seeking to recover the excess over 50% from [the Insured], and that it would
                        be an unmerited consequence to deprive them of their right to contribution.
                        Insurers should not be encouraged to take every legal defence, and pursue
                        every legal remedy which may be open to them against their assured. This is
                        a valid point so far as it goes. But to allow a claim against the defendants
                        based on such considerations would extend the equitable doctrine of
                        contribution beyond any previous authority....</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In a subsequent case of <em>Drake Insurance plc v Provident Insurance plc</em> [2004] QB 601
                        (“<em>Drake Insurance</em>”), <em>Legal and General Assurance</em> was accepted as good law,
                    but was distinguished. The facts in <em>Drake
                        Insurance</em> were very similar to the facts in <em>Legal and General Assurance</em>, which concerned two insurers who
                    provided third party motor insurance to the same party. However, in <em>Drake Insurance</em>, the defendant insurer obtained an
                    arbitral award to confirm that it could avoid its policy for non-disclosure. The
                    plaintiffs consistently but unsuccessfully attempted to encourage the defendant
                    to discharge its contractual obligation to the assured, and therefore paid out
                    in full to the assured. The plaintiff sought a 50% contribution from the
                    defendant. The trial court, applying <em>Legal &amp; General
                        Assurance</em>, dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. The English
                    Court of Appeal, reversing the lower court decision, held that the arbitral
                    award was not binding on the claimants, and in paying out in full, the
                    plaintiffs were not acting as volunteers. This is because the arbitral award
                    created an insuperable difficulty for the plaintiff to assert that the
                    defendants were liable to indemnify the assured, and the consistent protests of
                    the plaintiffs showed that payment had not been voluntary. The consistent
                    protests distinguished <em>Drake Insurance</em> from
                        <em>Legal &amp; General Assurance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the English Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment in <em>Drake Insurance</em>, Rix LJ expressed
                    serious doubts about the holding in <em>Legal &amp; General
                        Assurance</em> (at [128]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In reaching this conclusion, I have put on one side the fact that under
                        section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 Drake could in any event have
                        been compelled to make payment to Mr Beech once he had obtained an
                        unsatisfied judgment against Mrs Kaur. I do so because that was not
                        viewed as saving the situation in [<em>Legal &amp; General
                            Insurance</em>], <em>even though it is not clear to
                            me from the judgments in that case why the merely theoretical right to
                            recover the excess of Drake’s liability under
                            section 151(7)... should make all the difference</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clarke LJ expressed similar views at [157] - [158]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">157    ... I would only say about the decision that it
                            does seem to me to have unfortunate results if it means that an insurer,
                            instead of making a sensible settlement with the insured and
                            subsequently claiming contribution from a co-insurer, has to rely on the
                            “rateable proportion” clause in order to protect its
                            position against the co-insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">158    Perhaps the House of Lords will one day have an
                            opportunity to reconsider the [<em>Legal and General

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     
          <em>Drake Insurance</em>
                    has in turn been criticised by <em>Goff and Jones</em>, at
                    para 14-036. The authors opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, Drake Insurance’s protest did not magically oblige it to make
                        the payment. Secondly, the rateable proportion clause was not the subject of
                        litigation in Eagle Star. Thirdly, the fact that the claimant insurer was
                        liable to the third party for the whole loss did not mean that it could
                        claim contribution from the co-insurer. It could have recovered the excess
                        from the assured, as Lloyd LJ pointed out in <em>Legal and
                            General</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the authors of <em>Goff and Jones</em>
                    were also of the view that the fact that the defendant insurer had an arbitral
                    award in his favour was sufficient to justify the English Court of
                    Appeal’s conclusion. This is because if Drake had refused to pay more than
                    50%, the assured would have failed to recover the other 50% against Provident,
                    who had an arbitral award in his favour (which was eventually set aside): see
                    also <em>Macgillivray</em> at
                para 23-051.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     From the foregoing discussion, it is apparent
                    that regardless of the utility of legal compulsion as a touchstone of
                    voluntariness, it is not sufficient to explain every contribution and
                    reimbursement award. Before it was set aside, the arbitral award in <em>Drake Insurance</em>, while binding upon the assured and
                    Provident, did not bind Drake. Drake was thus not compelled by law, but by
                    necessity, in the circumstances, to fully indemnify the assured. Furthermore,
                    the requirement of legal compulsion is difficult to sustain in a case where a
                    claimant has freely undertaken his legal liability to its creditor. In double
                    insurance cases, usually, two indemnity insurers would have freely and
                    independently chosen to indemnify the same assured. It would be difficult to
                    justify why either of the insurers would be entitled to contribution using the
                    legal compulsion analysis, since they have both chosen voluntarily to expose
                    themselves to their legal obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Turning to the present case, like the English
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Drake Insurance</em>, I am of the
                    view that SHC’s right to reimbursement or contribution is not extinguished
                    because it has fully indemnified EIN in respect of its liability to Omar in Suit
                    527 of 2006 (but not Simei, see below at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>) out of practical necessity despite the legal efficacy of
                    its Non-contributory Clause in the EIN policy issued by it. On the facts, SHC
                    has consistently protested against bearing sole liability for indemnifying EIN.
                    I am therefore satisfied that SHC’s indemnification of EIN’s
                    liability was not voluntary nor without regard to the absence of legal liability
                    to EIN on account of its Non-contributory Clause. I based my decision on a
                    statement of agreed facts submitted by the parties to confirm, <em>inter alia</em>, the steps SHC had taken to engage NTUC to
                    provide EIN a full indemnity <em>before</em> SHC paid out
                    the amount to Omar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The parties agreed that not long after Omar
                    commenced the proceedings in Suit 527 of 2006, Pan-United, Simei and EIN
                    made their respective claims against SHC and NTUC. NTUC agreed to have conduct
                    of only Pan-United’s defence. Thereafter, SHC’s solicitors wrote to
                    NTUC’s solicitors, requesting NTUC to have conduct of Simei’s and
                    EIN’s defences, citing the Non-contributory Clause in the SHC Policies.
                    NTUC’s solicitors replied, refusing SHC’s request, on the ground
                    that its policy did not cover Simei and EIN, relying upon NTUC’s
                    Contingent Liability Clause. NTUC was added as a third party to Suit 527 of
                    2006, wherein SHC sought declarations from the court similar to those sought
                    today. Those proceedings were subsequently discontinued without prejudice to SHC
                    and NTUC’s respective rights and defences. SHC later commenced the present
                    proceedings. I am of the view that SHC’s conduct throughout showed that
                    its payment to EIN was not voluntary. If SHC, like NTUC, refused to provide
                    Simei and EIN with an indemnity on the ground that they have submitted a claim
                    against the wrong insurer, it would have been detrimental to SHC’s
                    business reputation. I also do not see why SHC ought to be penalised on the
                    ground that it paid out expeditiously, and for choosing to resolve the dispute
                    between itself and NTUC at a later date. In the circumstances, I find that SHC
                    is entitled to a full reimbursement from NTUC in respect of EIN’s
                    liability to Omar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     If SHC has paid out in respect of
                    Simei’s liability, I am of the view that SHC is not entitled to a
                    reimbursement from NTUC. In the present case, SHC simply did not adduce evidence
                    to the effect that it had taken any steps to ascertain whether Simei was liable
                    in its capacity as an employer, and in what capacity it has conceded liability
                    to Omar. Thus, SHC paid out, without regard as to whether its policy was on
                    risk, or even potentially on risk. Although the NTUC Policy was on risk, by
                    virtue of Simei’s liability being covered by the Contingent Liability
                    Clause, SHC should not be entitled to a reimbursement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     However, in any event, for the purposes of the
                    present application, I declare that NTUC is liable for reimbursing SHC for the
                    full amount it has paid to Omar in respect of EIN’s liability in
                    Suit 527 of 2006, <em>i.e</em>. $317,664.70. This is
                    because I find that the full sum of $317 664.70 must have been paid by SHC in
                    full indemnification of EIN’s liability. The parties have agreed that
                    Simei and EIN have admitted to liability to Omar jointly, and thus it was
                    impossible to apportion the liability for the amount of $317,664.70 between
                    Simei and EIN. However, there was nothing on the facts to prevent SHC from
                    paying out the full sum of $317,664.70 in respect of EIN’s liability as a
                    joint tortfeasor. In so doing, SHC would have also discharged Simei’s
                    liability to Omar under the consent judgment entered in Suit 527 of 2006.
                    It was EIN’s or Simei’s (or both’s) prerogative to seek an
                    indemnity, however much the amount, from SHC, as it deemed fit. Since Simei
                    would have no legal right to seek an indemnity from SHC under the terms of the
                    SHC Policies, I am of the view that the indemnity sought against SHC must have
                    been in respect of EIN’s liability. Having arrived at this conclusion, it
                    must necessarily follow that SHC may seek a reimbursement from NTUC, for the
                    amount of $317,664.70 which SHC has paid out in respect of EIN’s liability
                    as a jointly and severally liable tortfeasor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alternative analysis where proviso(a) in NTUC’s Contingent
                Liability Clause applies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For completeness, I will now analyse the
                    alternative factual scenario where I assume that Hock Swee has been separately
                    insured against liability for claims by a non-employee of Hock Swee, such as
                    Omar. In this alternative scenario, proviso (a) in NTUC’s Contingent
                    Liability Clause will then apply with the result that the NTUC policy will
                        <em>not</em> be on risk to cover Simei for claims made
                    against it by a non-employee of Simei <em>i.e</em>. Omar.
                    The outcome is that SHC will <em>not</em> be able to seek
                    any indemnity or reimbursement from NTUC for any insurance payment made out by
                    SHC to Simei. However, this possibility will make no difference to the final
                    outcome because (as has been explained above) SHC’s policy does not extend
                    to providing insurance coverage for Simei for claims made against it by persons
                    who are <em>not</em> employees of Simei. Strictly
                    therefore, SHC would <em>not</em> have paid out any
                    insurance monies on behalf of Simei, which was never covered by SHC for the
                    injuries to Omar. Accordingly, there is no contribution or reimbursement that
                    SHC can seek from NTUC to begin with and therefore, it would not have mattered
                    to SHC that proviso (a) applied in respect of the NTUC policy rendering
                    NTUC being not at risk to indemnify Simei for Omar’s claims. Under these
                    circumstances, SHC would have paid out the full sum of $317,664.70 only in
                    respect of EIN’s liability (and not Simei’s liability) as a joint
                    tortfeasor. In so doing, SHC would have also discharged Simei’s liability
                    to Omar under the consent judgment entered in Suit 527 of 2006. Accordingly, the
                    indemnity sought against SHC must have been in respect only of EIN’s
                    liability, for which the NTUC policy insuring EIN remained fully at risk. The
                    Non-contributory Clause in the SHC policy covering EIN was effective against
                    NTUC, there being double insurance in the case of EIN. It must necessarily
                    follow that SHC may seek a reimbursement from NTUC, for the amount of
                    $317,664.70 which SHC would have paid out in respect of EIN’s liability as
                    a jointly and severally liable tortfeasor. Even with this alternative factual
                    scenario, the same conclusion is reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the light of the above, I declare that NTUC
                    is legally obligated to reimburse SHC for the sum of $317,664.70, which was paid
                    by SHC to indemnify EIN and Simei for their liability arising out of
                    Suit 527 of 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The costs of this application are to be borne
