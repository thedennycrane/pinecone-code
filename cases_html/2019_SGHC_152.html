</div> Hence, the orders by the Court, as described above, all proceeded on the basis that there was a separate sum of S$300,000 which Mr Yang had provided from his own funds and for which the defendant was responsible for administering to take care of Mdm Sun.

While Mr Yang was still alive, the moneys in the joint accounts were jointly owned by the couple.  Mdm Sun had also contributed to these moneys from her own funds from Taiwan.  These had been remitted by Ms Hsu from Mdm Sun’s Taiwanese bank accounts to the UOB time deposit account.  When Mr Yang died, the ownership of the moneys in the joint accounts devolved to Mdm Sun on the basis of survivorship.  Even if the presumption of resulting trust were found in favour of Mr Yang’s estate, the presumption of advancement would have arisen in Mdm Sun’s favour.  On the evidence, this presumption has not been rebutted by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Secondly, Mr Sun argues that the defendant was aware that the moneys in the joint accounts were beneficially owned by Mdm Sun.

</div>  This presumption of resulting trust arose on the basis that Mdm Sun had had limited control over the joint accounts and was not involved in the management of her own financial affairs.  It was Mr Yang who had primarily been in charge of the couple’s finances and there was thus an intention on his part to retain his beneficial interest in the moneys in the joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The transactions which were executed in respect of the joint accounts were all premised on the defendant complying with the terms of the Will.  He required funds to pay for Mr Yang’s funeral expenses and to ensure that Mdm Sun continued to receive appropriate care.  His evidence under cross-examination was that the joint accounts with Citibank and UOB were the only source of funds from which he could draw since he had been granted mandates to operate those accounts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, the crux of the parties’ dispute turns on whether I find that the moneys in the joint accounts belonged to Mdm Sun after Mr Yang passed away.  If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, then the only substantive questions that remain to be answered are whether the defendant is obliged to return the moneys to Mdm Sun’s estate because he held the moneys subject to a constructive trust or whether he is excused from doing so because (i) he honestly believed that the moneys in the joint account belonged to Mr Yang solely, and (ii) he used a significant portion of the withdrawn sums for the care and maintenance of Mdm Sun while she was alive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ownership of the moneys in the joint accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51  It is not disputed that, following Mr Yang’s death, the defendant made several transactions in respect of the joint accounts with Citibank and UOB (see [20] above).  The parties’ disagreement centres on who was the beneficial owner of the moneys in those joint accounts after Mr Yang’s death.  The defendant’s case is that the moneys in the joint accounts belonged beneficially to Mr Yang’s estate and that Mdm Sun thus held the moneys in the joint accounts on trust for his estate.  In contrast, Mr Sun argues that Mdm Sun was the beneficial owner of the moneys in the joint accounts by reason of the operation of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant legal principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I begin with a survey of the relevant legal principles.  There are two types of concurrent interests over property in Singapore - the joint tenancy and the tenancy in common.  Joint tenancy refers to a form of co-ownership where parties own the entire interest in property devoid of “shares”.  A hallmark of joint tenancy is the right of survivorship.  Upon the death of a joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant(s) will take the entire interest in the property.  This is a convenient mechanism which does away with the need for a will or other formalities.  The operation of the right of survivorship also has important implications as to how joint tenants may deal with their property.  A joint tenant may dispose of their interest <span class="font-italic">during</span> their lifetime, effecting a severance of the joint tenancy to create a tenancy in common.  However, a joint tenant may not devise their interest in their will because the right of survivorship takes precedence over testamentary dispositions (Tang Hang Wu and Kelvin FK Low, <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Land Law</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) at [9.8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The principles of survivorship are equally applicable to joint bank accounts (per Warren L H Khoo J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Pow v Tan Seng Hock </span>[1992] SGHC 104 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Pow</span>”)).  In that case, there was a dispute as to the ownership of moneys in a joint bank account.  The deceased had opened the account with the defendant, one of her children.  After the deceased passed away, her remaining children claimed that the sums of over S$24,000 in the account were held on trust for the benefit of her estate.  Khoo J accepted the defendant’s submission that, in the case of a joint account, the survivor would be presumed to take the whole benefit of the account in the absence of a contrary intention.  On the evidence, such an intention was not established.  It was clear that the deceased had intended the defendant to be the sole beneficiary.  The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Pow</span> was affirmed by Prakash J, as she then was, in <span class="font-italic">Collars Muriel Esther de Jesus and Another v Sandra Audrey Jude Collars </span>[2008] SGHC 110 at [30]; in the case of a joint bank account, there is a presumption “that the survivor [takes] the whole of the benefit of the account in the absence of a contrary intention”.  Further, Prakash J found that the onus would be on the person challenging this right of survivorship to demonstrate such a contrary intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It follows that where such a contrary intention can be shown, the rule of survivorship may be displaced by a resulting trust or a presumed resulting trust.  A resulting trust will arise where there has been a transfer of property in circumstances where the deceased did not intend to benefit the survivor.  There is nothing before me which indicates that there was a <span class="font-italic">clear</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>intention by Mr Yang to retain beneficial ownership of the joint accounts.  As shall be seen below (at [67]–[68]), the circumstantial facts are equivocal.  In the absence of any direct evidence of Mr Yang’s intentions, a resulting trust would have no application in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This leaves the presumption of resulting trust.  The presumption of resulting trust operates where there has been a transfer of property to the survivor for which they have not provided the whole of the consideration (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terrence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [35] citing Robert Chambers, <span class="font-italic">Resulting Trusts</span> (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1997) at p 32) and there is no evidence before the court which “adequately reveals the true intention of the transferor” (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 at [79]).  The deceased’s lack of intention to benefit the survivor is inferred.  Lord Browne-Wilkinson provided an illustration of the presumption’s operation in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutche</span>”) at 708.  The judge observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contributions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Where the presumption of resulting trust arises, the burden of proof shifts such that “the [deceased] is presumed to have intended to retain the beneficial ownership” of the property (per Abella J in <span class="font-italic">Pecore v Pecore</span> (2007) 279 DLR (4th) 513 (“<span class="font-italic">Pecore</span>”) at [81]).  Consequently, if this presumption is not displaced, the survivors hold the property on trust for the deceased’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The rationale behind the application of the presumed resulting trust in cases of joint tenancies was discussed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>.  The Court noted at [83] that the operation of survivorship “has the effect of divesting a deceased joint tenant of his unsevered interest and giving the survivor the entirety of the estate, producing a disproportionate effect” (citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 9(2) (LexisNexis, 2003) at para 110.026).  This goes against the equitable maxim, equality is equity.  A tenancy in common is comparatively fairer to co-owners as they hold their beneficial interests in proportion to their respective contributions to the property’s purchase price.  Therefore, the general position is that, in the absence of an express declaration, contrary intention or equal monetary contribution by the parties, “legal joint tenants (…) will be presumed to hold that property as beneficial tenants in common of shares proportionate to their contribution to the acquisition of that property” (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [83]).  A surviving joint tenant would hold the deceased’s share of the property on trust for his estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 That being said, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> pointed out that the presumption of resulting trust should not be applied mechanically.  There may be situations where, on an evaluation of the facts, the presumption clearly does not reflect the reality of the parties’ intentions.  The Court thus held that the strength of the presumption has to be accorded varying weight depending on the particular circumstances of each case (at [46]).  For instance, in respect of married couples who have contributed jointly to the purchase of a property, the strength of the presumption would generally be weaker because there is a presumptive inference that spouses also intend to hold property as joint tenants in equity (at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 There are other means of circumventing the presumption of resulting trust, which is a rebuttable presumption of law (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [46]).  In certain circumstances, the deceased (the transferor) may be regarded as having made a gift to the recipient, with no intention to retain an interest in the property concerned.  This is the presumption of advancement.  This presumption is only relevant where a presumed resulting trust has already been found on the facts, with the former operating to displace the latter (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [57]).  If applicable, it shifts the burden of proof <span class="font-italic">back</span> to the party who challenges the transfer to the surviving recipient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There are certain types of relationships, such as the transfers of property from husband to wife and from father to child, which attract the presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [60]).  The courts have accepted that, within these established categories of relationships, transfers of property are intended to be gifts in favour of the recipient.  Although limited in number, the scope of these categories has been judicially expanded over time to accommodate shifting social realities and practices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, these modifications have been criticised as not being drastic enough.  The spousal presumption does not extend to transfers from wives to their husbands.  This ignores the fact that many women are financially independent and often make significant monetary contributions in acquiring property with the intention that the property should be held jointly in equity.  Unmarried cohabiting couples are also excluded from the presumption’s ambit.  These criticisms were considered by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> which held that the presumption of advancement nevertheless remained relevant.  It accepted, however, that the application of the presumption had to be refined to accommodate contemporary norms.  Like the presumption of resulting trust, the Court held that the strength of the presumption should vary according to the individual circumstances of each case (at [77]).  This would allow a court to more accurately give effect to the parties’ intentions.  A weaker presumption of advancement will be more easily displaced if there is sufficient evidence to rebut it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In considering what individual circumstances courts should take into account, the Court expanded on the dicta in <span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Low Geok Khim and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah</span>”), where Chan Sek Keong CJ considered what effect the degree of the recipient’s financial independence would have on the strength of the presumption of advancement (at [43]–[44]).  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> determined that financial independence was a relevant factor but was just one of several to consider.  It endorsed a fact-sensitive inquiry, taking into consideration <span class="font-italic">all</span> the circumstances of the case.  There were two key elements to consider in guiding this inquiry (at [78]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A court should first look at the nature of the relationship between the parties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the obligation that one party has to another). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the court should consider the state of the relationship (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the parties were in a close or distant relationship).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>itself is a good illustration of this approach.  The case concerned a dispute over the estate of the deceased, Yeo. He had been thrice married and died intestate as a result of the statutory revocation of his will by his third marriage.  Yeo’s two sons from his first marriage then sought to claim an interest in his estate via intestacy, arguing that there was a resulting trust in their favour.  His widow asserted that the properties in dispute had been held on the basis of a joint tenancy and therefore passed to her on the basis of survivorship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Court found that, while there was a presumption of resulting trust in respect of both properties, there was also a strong presumption of advancement.  Yeo’s wife had been financially independent whilst Yeo did not work.  This went towards the nature of the parties’ relationship.  The Court reiterated that financial independence was only one relevant factor and did not preclude the application of the presumption (at [139]).  It then went on to consider the state of the parties’ relationship, which had been close and loving (at [141]).  The Court also considered the fact that the properties were held in joint tenancy <span class="font-italic">after</span> the parties had received legal advice on the effect of a joint tenancy (at [137]).  It was clear that Yeo had intended to confer the benefit of survivorship to his surviving spouse (at [148]).  Accordingly, she was entitled to absolute ownership of the properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 To summarise, in determining whether the right of survivorship should operate in favour of a surviving joint-tenant, the court should adopt the following stages of analysis:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) consider if the facts give rise to a presumption of resulting trust; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) if the presumption of resulting trust applies, determine its strength based on the individual factual matrix of the case;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) consider if the presumption of advancement is applicable; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) if the presumption of advancement applies, determine its strength based on the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> and <span class="font-italic">state</span> of the parties’ relationship; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) based on the weight of the evidence, determine if the presumption of advancement has been successfully rebutted. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If the challenging party succeeds in defeating the presumption of advancement, then the original presumption of resulting trust will operate.  Conversely, if they fail, the presumption of advancement will displace the presumption of resulting trust and the right of survivorship shall take effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As a final point, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> confirmed that the foregoing principles were also applicable to bank accounts which are jointly held and operated by spouses.  In such cases, there is a strong inference that the right of survivorship is intended to apply.  The existence of bank documents declaring the operation of survivorship, or at least demonstrating evidence of the parties’ intention for the sums to devolve to the surviving account holder, would strengthen this inference (at [108]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 With this in mind, I now consider whether the right of survivorship operated in Mdm Sun’s favour in respect of the joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Mr Sun argues that the moneys in the joint accounts were intended to be held jointly by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun, and would therefore be subject to the operation of survivorship upon Mr Yang’s death.  This supposed intention was premised on several key facts.  Unlike their bank accounts in Taiwan, all of the couple’s monetary assets in Singapore had been consolidated and were held in joint accounts.

</div>  Lastly, Mr Yang, who was known to be careful with his finances, made no provision for the joint accounts in the Will. According to Mr Sun, this was indicative of the fact that he did not consider the joint accounts would form part of his estate and that the sums therein should devolve to Mdm Sun upon his death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In contrast, the defendant asserted that Mr Yang had not intended for the moneys in the joint accounts to be a gift to Mdm Sun.  It was Mr Yang who had been primarily in control of the couple’s finances.  An example of this was the remittance of US$12,070 on 20 June 2007 by Ms Hsu to the couple’s UOB time deposit joint account.  Although this sum related to a joint investment which had been made by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun, the directions to remit the money to the account only came from Mr Yang.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In making this point, the defendant analogised the facts in this case with the decision in <span class="font-italic">Saylor v Madsen Estate </span>(2006) 261 DLR (4th) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Saylor</span>”) (cited in <span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah </span>at [52]–[53]).  In <span class="font-italic">Saylor</span>, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the findings of the trial judge that a father, whose daughter had been a joint signatory to his bank accounts, had been the only person in control of the finances therein.  The father had claimed all interest from the accounts for tax purposes and during his lifetime, his daughter had not deposited any of her own money into the accounts.  She also only drew cheques on the account on her father’s directions.  The trial judge consequently found that there was “no evidence to support [the daughter’s] position that [the father had] intended to gift the contents of his joint accounts to her.” (<span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah</span> at [52]).  Similarly, it was contended that Mr Yang’s exclusive control over the joint accounts was not suggestive of an intention to make a gift to Mdm Sun, but instead to retain beneficial ownership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Bearing the parties’ arguments in mind, I applied the analysis laid down in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> to determine whether the presumption of resulting trust arose over the moneys in the joint accounts.  It is not disputed that Mdm Sun contributed to the joint accounts.  At least US$418,000 was remitted from Mdm Sun’s Taiwanese bank accounts to the UOB time deposit joint account.  That being said, no evidence has been produced to demonstrate additional contributions by Mdm Sun.  This suggests that Mr Yang was the contributor of the remaining amounts in the joint accounts.  I found this inference to be reasonable because Mr Yang continued to work in Singapore for a number of years

</div> whilst Mdm Sun had retired.  He carried on working even after the purchase of the Tomlinson Property.  Having a steady income, it is likely that he would have contributed more consistently to the couple’s savings than the one-off transfers made from Mdm Sun’s accounts.  On the basis of these unequal contributions, I accept that the presumption of resulting trust arises with respect to some part of the moneys in the joint accounts although there is insufficient evidence before we to say how much.  However, the strength of this presumption would be weaker in light of the fact that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun were married.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I turn next to whether the presumption of advancement could operate to displace this initial presumption.  The transfer of property from husband to wife clearly falls within one of the established categories which give rise to the presumption of advancement.  The setting up of the joint accounts by Mr Yang and Mdm Sun on terms that stipulate that the surviving account holder would be entitled to all the moneys therein would show an intention by Mr Yang to make a gift of the moneys to Mdm Sun should she survive him.  Having established that the presumption of advancement is applicable, this then leads to an assessment as to the strength of the presumption and if it can be rebutted by contrary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Mr Yang’s and Mdm Sun’s marriage was traditional in nature.  After retiring from her job in Taiwan and moving to Singapore, Mdm Sun became a homemaker.  Mr Yang then became the sole breadwinner and she remained financially dependent on him.  Their living arrangement in Singapore reflects one of the original rationales behind the spousal presumption.  As explained by Lord Reid in <span class="font-italic">Pettit v Pettit</span> [1970] AC 777 at 793, “wives’ economic dependence on their husbands made it necessary as a matter of public policy to give them this advantage”.  Applying this reasoning, a greater level of dependence in the relationship points to a stronger presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The facts of <span class="font-italic">Saylor</span> are distinguishable from the instant case.  Unlike Mdm Sun, the daughter in <span class="font-italic">Saylor</span> made no monetary contributions to the joint accounts.  She also acted entirely on her father’s instructions.  It would appear that she was nothing more than a formal joint signatory, for the purpose of expedience or convenience.  I do not think that the evidence goes so far in this case to show that Mdm Sun surrendered the general management of the joint accounts to Mr Yang.  She was certainly not oblivious to or unconcerned about transactions being made in relation to the joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In her evidence, Ms Hsu noted that whilst Mr Yang had given the instructions on the transfer of the US$12,070, Mdm Sun had also been privy to this information.

</div>  This shows that Mdm Sun was involved in decisions concerning her financial affairs.  The need for Mdm Sun’s authorisation for the defendant to operate the joint accounts also demonstrates that she was not as disconnected from the management of her finances as the defendant claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As for the state of the couple’s relationship, the evidence points to them having a close and caring marriage which lasted more than 50 years.  Mr Yang made an express provision for Mdm Sun’s care in the Will.  He also made her a joint tenant of the Tomlinson Property along with the defendant.  This points to efforts made by Mr Yang to ensure that Mdm Sun would be maintained and cared for comfortably after he died.  This being the case, it cannot be fairly concluded that, as it was in <span class="font-italic">Saylor</span>, there is no evidence that Mdm Sun was intended to have ownership of the moneys in the joint accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Besides the inferred intentions of Mr Yang, Mr Sun also put forward documentary evidence as to the terms and conditions of DBS (who owns POSB) and UOB which indicated that the moneys in the joint accounts would devolve to Mdm Sun upon her husband’s death.  This strengthens the presumption of advancement.  This fact was communicated to the defendant, in his capacity as the executor of Mr Yang’s estate, by way of letters from the banks after they were informed of Mr Yang’s death.  In its letter dated 24 August 2012, DBS provided the balance amount in the POSB joint account as of 15 May 2012.  It also went on to state as follows:

It is important to add that this in itself is not conclusive of the operation of survivorship.

</div>  I accept Mr Sun’s submission.  I find that the level of control which Mr Yang had over the couple’s assets does not weaken the presumption of advancement.  Indeed, I found this factor to be rather equivocal on the question of whether the presumption is rebutted.  Besides this, the defendant has not put forward any other objective evidence to rebut the operation of survivorship.  I do not accept that the provision made for Mdm Sun in the Will is exhaustive and therefore reflects an intention to exclude any other beneficial interest in her favour.

</div>
</div>  But, this does not answer the question conclusively because the bank was only informed of Mr Yang’s death almost two months after he died.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Disclosure of the POSB bank statements would have shed light on this issue of the missing S$3,093.48.  Mr Sun urges me to draw an adverse inference against the defendant for not producing the relevant POSB bank statements.  However, it was well within the power of Mr Sun to obtain the relevant documents and information from POSB since he is the lawful representative of Mdm Sun’s estate, but he did not do so.  Given the absence of evidence produced by Mr Sun in this regard, I find that he has not discharged the burden of showing that this withdrawal of S$3,093.48 was effected by the defendant.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendant is a constructive trustee of the sums withdrawn from the UOB and Citibank joint accounts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Mr Sun claims that the defendant became subject to duties as a constructive trustee by reason of his dealing with moneys in the joint accounts that did not belong to the estate of Mr Yang.  Where there is conduct which amounts to a legal or an equitable wrong, an institutional constructive trust may arise by operation of law.  Although there is no fixed test to determine when such a trust arises, “the fundamental question is whether the conscience of the recipient is bound in such a way as to justify equity in imposing a trust on him” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Megarry VC in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">Re Montagu’s Settlement Trusts Duke of Manchester v National Westminster Bank Ltd </span>[1987] Ch 264 at 277.  The requirement that the defendant’s conscience must be affected means that he cannot be held to be a trustee if he is ignorant of the facts that would have affected his conscience (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span> at 705).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Discounting the certainty of intention, the other certainties required of private trusts also apply to constructive trusts.  Accordingly, the trustee or beneficiary must be defined with sufficient certainty (John McGhee &amp; <span class="font-italic">Ors</span>, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at [26-004]) and there must be identifiable trust property.  However, the scope of the constructive trustee’s duties is narrower than that of a trustee who has given an express undertaking to hold the property on trust.  He is not subject to the irreducible core of fiduciary obligations, to perform the trust honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiary, owed by express trustees.  This is because the trust is created by law and it would be unreasonable to impose such obligations on constructive trustees.  Indeed, a constructive trust is “very often a bare trust and, as such, only requires the trustee to convey the trust property when called upon to do so” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”) at [190]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Of course, until the trust property is conveyed to the beneficiary, the trustee will remain subject to other duties <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to retain or preserve the property and, if he deals with it, to account for that to the beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2018] SGHC 131 at [99]–[100] as per Coomaraswamy J in the context of a resulting trust).  I should also mention that the Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> did not foreclose the possibility that involuntary trustees may owe fiduciary obligations.  It noted that “the <span class="font-italic">facts and circumstances</span> leading to the imposition of a resulting trust may also disclose an undertaking by the trustee – whether <span class="font-italic">express </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span><span class="font-italic"> implied</span> – to act in a certain way” [emphasis in original] (at [196]).  There is no reason in principle why this reasoning should not extend to constructive trustees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 According to Mr Sun, the requirements of a constructive trust are fulfilled in this case.  The certainties of subject matter and the beneficiary are satisfied.  The only contest is whether the defendant’s conduct of dealing with the moneys in the joint accounts was unconscionable.  Mr Sun’s case is that the defendant was always aware that the moneys in the accounts belonged to Mdm Sun.  Therefore, his withdrawals from the joint accounts amounted to dishonest misappropriations.

</div>  The defendant, on the other hand, argues that he honestly believed that the moneys in the joint account belonged beneficially to Mr Yang’s estate and he was simply carrying out his duties in good faith as the executor by constituting the fund of S$300,000 necessary to care for Mdm Sun as provided for under the Will.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Was the defendant’s conscience affected?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the defendant’s evidence on the withdrawals from the joint accounts with Citibank and UOB shifted considerably throughout the proceedings.

</div>.  He also amended his defence in the midst of trial to admit to carrying out those transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As I have mentioned, it is not correct for the defendant to claim that he had disclosed these withdrawals from the joint accounts of the Mr Yang and Mdm Sun in the course of the earlier legal proceedings in OSF 9/2013.  None of the defendant’s affidavits filed in OSF 9/2013 refer to withdrawals from the accounts.  In my view, it is quite evident that the defendant initially sought to conceal these transactions.  When this was no longer possible, he then tried to present himself as having always been transparent on the withdrawals.  This is troubling.  If the defendant had been acting for legitimate purposes, there would have been no need for such evasive behaviour.  This suggests that he was aware that the transactions should not have been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I come now to the defendant’s state of knowledge as to the ownership of the moneys in the joint accounts.  There can be no dispute that the defendant was aware that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun were not only joint account holders, but co-signatories of the joint accounts.  This was made clear in the letters of 21 August 1996 and 11 May 2005 from Mr Yang to him.  Also, his own evidence was that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had jointly executed mandates for him to operate the UOB and Citibank joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The evidence also showed that the defendant was probably aware that Mdm Sun’s savings from Taiwan had been remitted to Singapore.  Ms Hsu’s evidence was that she told the defendant, not long after Mr Yang’s death in May 2012, that the Sun family had asked her to provide them with copies of the remittance slips showing that moneys were transferred from Mdm Sun’s accounts in Taiwan to Singapore.

</div>  The defendant was thus informed about Mdm Sun’s savings being remitted to Singapore.  Given that he was familiar with the finances of the couple, the defendant knew that they held almost all their moneys in joint accounts.  As such, it is reasonable to infer that the defendant was aware that Mdm Sun probably contributed her own savings to the pool of moneys in the joint accounts at Citibank and UOB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 During the trial, in his evidence, the defendant also demonstrated familiarity with the concept of joint ownership and survivorship.

</div>  He recognised that he and Mdm Sun were the joint owners of the Tomlinson Property after Mr Yang died.  He claimed not to have touched the moneys in the POSB joint account which I have already found belong beneficially to Mdm Sun.  He could not give any coherent explanation as to why he treated the joint accounts with UOB and Citibank differently.  I find that the defendant should therefore have been aware of the operation of the right of survivorship over the joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I find that the defendant’s conduct in withdrawing the moneys from the joint accounts in a rush after Mr Yang’s death, before telling the banks about what had happened to Mr Yang, reveals the defendant’s thinking at that time.  He must have known that the moneys in the joint accounts would be treated by the banks as belonging to the surviving account-holder and that he would not be permitted to withdraw the moneys.  This was in fact confirmed by the letters from DBS and UOB to this effect, after he informed them in July 2012 about Mr Yang’s death.  Thus, the defendant was cognisant that what he was doing was wrong.  He chose not to disclose the truth to the banks so as to allow him to carry out the withdrawals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The defendant tried to justify the withdrawals by explaining that he needed funds to pay for Mdm Sun’s continuing expenses and for Mr Yang’s funeral arrangements.

</div>  However, such an explanation does not indicate to me that he was unaware as to who owned the moneys in the joint accounts.  Rather, it suggests that the defendant felt it expedient to disregard questions of ownership because he needed the funds to carry out his duties as the executor of Mr Yang’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 On this point, it is relevant to note that the defendant was by no means cash-strapped.  He had over S$690,000 in his personal Citibank accounts at the time of Mr Yang’s death.  He thus had the means to continue maintaining Mdm Sun, which in his own estimation cost about S$4,000 a month and which I would observe is a very generous estimate.

</div>  This is on the assumption that there are <span class="font-italic">no</span> other sources of cash in Mr Yang’s estate.  So, if the defendant honestly believed that the moneys in the joint accounts belonged solely to Mr Yang’s estate, he could have obtained the grant of probate and then applied for the necessary order of court that the banks pay over the money to him as the executor of Mr Yang’s estate.  In fact, his own evidence was that he would have had no difficulty if he had to pay for the funeral expenses and Mdm Sun’s care first, and then claim reimbursement from the estate.

Not only that, as was pointed out by Mr Sun, the defendant left a few thousand dollars in the Citibank and UOB joint accounts.

</div>  On the contrary, it seemed to me that he appreciated the significance of joint account ownership.  Having such an understanding, I cannot accept that the defendant carried out the transactions in respect of the joint accounts honestly and in good faith.  His knowledge that Mdm Sun was the owner of the moneys in the joint accounts made his conduct unconscionable.  The law would therefore impose a constructive trust in respect of the sums that were withdrawn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Non-disclosure of Mdm Sun’s assets to her extended family </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Sun claims that the defendant represented to the Sun family that Mdm Sun’s assets were limited to the passbooks for the Taiwanese bank accounts which he handed over to Mr Sun’s brother in July 2012.  This denied Mdm Sun the benefit of better care because her extended family was unaware of the additional funds she had.  The defendant argues that Mdm Sun’s family were not beneficiaries of the Will and he therefore had no obligation to disclose the assets owned by “the late Mr Yang and/or the late Mdm Sun at that material time”.

</div>
</div>  On this point, I have already found that the defendant was aware that the moneys in the joint accounts did not belong to Mr Yang’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 An alternative justification put forward was that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had granted him the mandate over some of the joint accounts and it was on this basis that he could use the moneys to care for Mdm Sun.  However, given that Mr Yang had passed away and it is common ground between the parties that Mdm Sun was mentally incapacitated at the time of Mr Yang’s death, there is no basis for the defendant to rely on the mandates that had been given for him to operate the joint accounts.  It is a well-established principle that any authority given by way of a power of attorney or a mandate to operate bank accounts on behalf of the donor, save in the case of a lasting power of attorney, is revoked as a matter of law once the donor ceases to have mental capacity.  “If the donor ceases to have the capacity to do the acts for which a power of attorney delegates authority, that power comes to an end” (Shindler and Sherry, <span class="font-italic">Aldridge: Powers of Attorney</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2016) at [7-06]).  Also, as stated by the authors of <span class="font-italic">Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2010) at [10-015] and [10-020]: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The actual authority of an agent, whether conferred by deed or not and whether expressed to be irrevocable or not, is determined by the death or supervening mental incapacity of either the principal or the agent … There is fairly clear authority that the agent’s actual authority determines where the principal becomes mentally incapable… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Hence, any authority granted by Mdm Sun would have come to an end by the time of Mr Yang’s passing in May 2012, at the very latest, since parties are in agreement that Mdm Sun lacked mental capacity at that time.  It follows that the defendant would not have had the authority to act on her behalf to withdraw any moneys from the joint bank accounts or expend those sums without her consent.  It is not open to the defendant to argue that <span class="font-italic">because</span> Mdm Sun’s mental state had begun to deteriorate, he was entitled to make decisions and/or expenditures on her behalf.

</div>
</div>  This would be to ignore the scope of his authority to act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As such, I find that, by not informing Mr Sun of the moneys that he had withdrawn from the joint accounts, the defendant breached his duties as a constructive trustee over these sums in his possession.  I should add that the point was also made by Lai J in <span class="font-italic">Mrs Yang</span> <span class="font-italic">Chun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [33] that Mr Yang had intended for Mdm Sun to “live out her remaining days in as much comfort as possible”.  I think that it was not enough that the defendant was simply maintaining the same standard of care that she had had prior to Mr Yang’s death when her condition was evidently deteriorating.  There was an obligation to make the funds in the joint account, which in any event belonged to Mdm Sum, available to Mdm Sun’s lawful attorney, so that he could decide whether the level of care provided to her was appropriate and adequate.  Regrettably, this was not done. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Acting in accordance with the Will</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In his closing submissions, the defendant maintains that he withdrew funds from the joint accounts to execute the terms of the Will, that is, to constitute the sum of S$300,000 which Mr Yang had set aside to provide for Mdm Sun’s care and maintenance.  He should therefore be absolved from any wrongdoing.  However, this is not a tenable position to take because it proceeds on the fundamental misconception that the moneys in the joint accounts were for Mr Yang to dispose of by way of a testamentary bequest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Will provided for the sum of S$300,000 to be taken from Mr Yang’s estate.  However, the moneys in the joint accounts belonged to Mdm Sun, not Mr Yang.  As such, the sums from the joint accounts could not be used to constitute the S$300,000 that had been set aside for Mdm Sun.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The defendant claimed that Mr Yang had no other sources of funds from which he could constitute the amount of S$300,000.  I have some doubt as to whether the defendant has disclosed the full extent of Mr Yang’s estate given that, as mentioned above, there was an excess of S$2m in the joint accounts at UOB alone when the Will was prepared near the end of 2007 and Mr Yang passed away less than four and a half years later.  Not only that, the defendant never stated that Mr Yang’s estate had no other assets in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief or his defence.  He made this claim for the first time under cross-examination.

</div>  However, even if it was the case that there were no other sources of funds, it did not follow that the defendant would be justified in laying his hands on moneys that did not belong to Mr Yang’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevance of how a part of the withdrawn sums were expended</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The defendant asserts that just over S$300,000 of the funds taken from the joint accounts were applied by him towards for Mdm Sun’s care and maintenance up to the time she passed away.  He claims to have a kept a detailed record of these expenditures, together with supporting receipts.  Mr Sun questions whether there has been a proper or full account of these expenses incurred by the defendant on Mdm Sun.

</div>  I am unsure what the legal basis is for such a submission and the defendant has not articulated any in his submissions.  I have already found that the defendant’s conduct with respect to the withdrawals of the moneys from the joint accounts was wrongful and rendered him a constructive trustee of the amounts that had been withdrawn.  In my judgment, the way in which the defendant subsequently expended these sums is not relevant in establishing his liability to account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In any event, the other difficulty faced by the defendant in respect of these expenses is that he has not provided evidence to show the source of the moneys that he expended on Mdm Sun.  As I have already alluded to at [19] and [112], I have doubts as to whether the defendant has disclosed the full extent of Mr Yang’s estate.  In other words, I am unable to conclude from the evidence that there were no other sources of cash that Mr Yang had in his lifetime and that therefore the expenses incurred for Mdm Sun’s care <span class="font-italic">must</span> have come from moneys withdrawn from the joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The defendant’s evidence was that he constituted the sum of S$300,000 that was used to care for Mdm Sun, as required by the Will, in his UOB account.

</div> and were from the moneys which originated from the joint accounts of Mr Yang and Mdm Sun.  However, the defendant has chosen not to disclose his bank statements for this UOB account.  Hence, there is no evidence to support his assertion that the expenses were paid with moneys from that account.  Further, given that the defendant admits the UOB account is a mixture of his own moneys and the moneys from the joint accounts of Mr Yang and Mdm Sun, I find it difficult to understand how the defendant can assert that it was the latter moneys which were incurred for Mdm Sun’s care and maintenance.  The operative presumption is that when a trustee mixes his personal moneys with trust moneys, any expenditure from the mixed fund is first regarded as the trustee’s personal moneys (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at [30-057]; <span class="font-italic">In re Hallett’s Estate</span> (1880) 13 Ch D 696 at 726–729).  Without sight of the defendant’s UOB bank account statements, it is impossible for the defendant to establish that he had utilised the moneys from the joint accounts of Mr Yang and Mdm Sum for the care and upkeep of Mdm Sun.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Insofar as the defendant may have incurred his own moneys for the care of Mdm Sun in the period of 2012 to 2016, it is perhaps possible that he might have some claim against the estate of Mdm Sun for recovery of a debt.  But, that is not the defendant’s pleaded case.  There is also no plea of any set-off in the defence or reference to this in the closing submissions.  I therefore do not consider that issue any further.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claim of unjust enrichment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In the alternative to its claim for breach of trust, Mr Sun claims that the defendant is liable in unjust enrichment.  He is required to account for the joint account moneys having been unjustly enriched by his wrongful conversion, misappropriation and/or retention of the funds.  The elements of a claim in unjust enrichment were set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2011] 3 SLR 540 at [110]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant must have received a benefit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he was enriched); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the enrichment was at the claimant’s expense; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) it is unjust to allow the defendant to retain the enrichment; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) there are no defences available to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Having found that the defendant is constructive trustee over the amounts withdrawn from the joint accounts and is thus liable to account for and return these amounts, there is no need for me to deal with the claim for unjust enrichment in any detail, save to say that it is quite clear that the defendant has been unjustly enriched by his receipt of moneys belonging to Mdm Sun, and he is bound to restore the moneys to Mdm Sun’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In circumstances of a breach of trust and/or fiduciary duties, the beneficiary may have both personal and proprietary remedies available to him.

The defendant will hold the property as a bare trustee and is obliged to convey the property as the claimant directs (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at [26-005]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In this case, for the reasons set out above in this judgment, I find that the defendant is a constructive trustee of the amount of S$515,000 which had been withdrawn from the UOB and Citibank joint accounts.

Insofar as any of the withdrawn moneys are still in his possession, they are subject to a constructive trust, and must be restored to Mdm Sun’s estate.
