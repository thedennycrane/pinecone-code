The order was made on the Bankrupt’s own application, which he had filed earlier that month. The order appointed the defendants jointly as his trustees in bankruptcy (“the Trustees”). With effect from 30 March 2017, therefore, all of the Bankrupt’s property vested in the Trustees under s 76(1) read with s 36(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is the Bankrupt’s wife. They were married in 1981 and remain married to date. They have three adult children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Bankrupt is the sole registered owner of a property known as 62 Sunrise Drive, Singapore 806565 (“the Property”). He bought the Property in August 2011 in his sole name. The Property was purchased to be a home for the Bankrupt, the plaintiff and their children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff now brings this action against the Trustees seeking a declaration that the Bankrupt holds 50% of the beneficial interest in the Property on a common intention constructive trust for her. Alternatively, she seeks a declaration that a proprietary estoppel has arisen in her favour, entitling her to 50% of the beneficial interest in the Property or such other beneficial interest in the Property as the court determines. The plaintiff has expressly disavowed any reliance on any other equitable basis for the beneficial interest which she claims in the Property, including any reliance on a resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Trustees’ position is that the Bankrupt is not only the sole legal owner of the Property but also the sole beneficial owner of the Property. They therefore deny that the plaintiff has any beneficial interest in the Property of any kind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Property has at all material times been subject to the provisions of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The plaintiff was a Malaysian citizen from birth in 1955 until December 2011. From shortly after her marriage to the Bankrupt in 1981 until December 2011, she was also a permanent resident of Singapore. In December 2011, she renounced her Malaysian citizenship and became a Singapore citizen. She remains a Singapore citizen to this date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Trustees’ position is that the plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed on the following principal grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The factual basis on which the plaintiff claims a common intention constructive trust and seeks to establish a proprietary estoppel is a lie.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Act prohibits either a common intention constructive trust or a proprietary estoppel from arising in the plaintiff’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff has suffered no detrimental reliance sufficient to give rise to either a common intention constructive trust or a proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The plaintiff should be denied equitable relief because she has engaged in unconscionable conduct and because she does not come to equity with clean hands.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Bankrupt </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Bankrupt is not a party to this action. But he lies at the heart of the factual underpinning of this action. I therefore begin with a thumbnail sketch of the Bankrupt and his path to bankruptcy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Bankrupt is an entrepreneur and businessman. He appears to have displayed conspicuous acumen and, at least until his bankruptcy, to have enjoyed considerable success in both of these capacities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Until his bankruptcy, the Bankrupt’s principal business interests were his substantial shareholding and his executive or consulting roles in two companies operating in the healthcare sector which he co-founded

My conclusion is that it does. That renders it unnecessary for me to consider the remaining issues which both the plaintiff and the defendants have raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I now explain how I have come to this conclusion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The provisions of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Trustees’ case is that ss 3, 23(1) and 25(2) of the Act defeat the plaintiff’s claim <span class="font-italic">in limine</span> because they operate to prevent her, as a non-citizen at the time of the conveyance in August 2011, from acquiring any interest in the Property under a common intention constructive trust or by way of a proprietary estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Act prohibited the plaintiff from acquiring any estate or interest in the Property in August 2011 or at any time before December 2011. It is common ground that the plaintiff was a “foreign person” within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Act at all times before December 2011. It is also common ground that the Property is and has at all times been “residential property” within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Act. Section 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act prohibits any person from creating any “estate or interest” in residential property in favour of a foreign person. Section 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act renders void any “estate or interest” created by any person in favour of a foreign person in contravention of s 3(1) of the Act. A breach of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act is a criminal offence under s 36 of the Act and is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Act also prohibited the Bankrupt from holding any interest in the Property on trust for the plaintiff in August 2011 or at any time before December 2011. Section 23(1) of the Act prohibits any Singapore citizen from purchasing residential property as a nominee of any foreign person with the intention of holding it in trust for that foreign person. Section 23(2) renders void any trust “created in whatever manner or form” contrary to s 23(1). A contravention of s 23(1) of the Act is a criminal offence under s 23(4) of the Act and is punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for up to three years or both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Section 25(2) of the Act obliges any foreign person who desires to purchase or acquire any estate or interest in residential property to secure the Minister’s approval to do so. It is common ground that the plaintiff has at no time made any such application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The common intention constructive trust is void</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my view, the common intention constructive trust which the plaintiff pleads is caught by the terms of the Act and is void under both ss 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 23(2) of the Act. That is because her case rests on an express common intention by which the Bankrupt and she agreed that he would hold 50% of the beneficial interest in the Property on trust for her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The plaintiff submits that the words “estate or interest” in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are not wide enough to capture a beneficial interest arising under a common intention constructive trust. I do not accept this submission. In my view, that reads the words too narrowly. Those words are certainly wide enough to capture a common intention constructive trust said to arise from an express intention to create a beneficial interest. Any narrower interpretation would eviscerate the purpose of these prohibitions in the Act. I say nothing about a common intention constructive trust which does not arise from an express intention, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, which arises from an inferred or imputed intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiff relies on the decision of Yong Pung How CJ in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 154 (“<span class="font-italic">Intra Group</span>”) as authority for the proposition that the Act does not prohibit a constructive trust arising by operation of law. <span class="font-italic">Intra</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span> is not authority for such a wide proposition. <span class="font-italic">Intra</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span> is authority only for the limited proposition that a constructive trust which arises from a transfer of a person’s property against his wishes, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by reason of fraud – and which therefore arises to reverse a detriment which that person has suffered – is not within the scope of the Act (at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Indeed, Yong Pung How CJ made clear in <span class="font-italic">Intra</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span> that any trust arising from the parties’ intention to create a proprietary interest in the beneficiary’s favour would still be within the scope of the prohibitions in the Act, even if the parties did not reach an express agreement to create a trust (at [19]). As he held, that is because the Act prohibits “trusts created by a transfer of property with the consent of, or the intention to benefit, the beneficiary” (at [19]). That is precisely the type of trust which the plaintiff claims arose in her favour. That type of constructive trust is outside any proposition for which <span class="font-italic">Intra</span> <span class="font-italic">Group</span> is authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The plaintiff submits that s 23 of the Act does not deal with a case where a Singapore citizen acquires property and holds it on trust for a foreign person who eventually acquires Singapore citizenship, as the plaintiff did in December 2011. I do not accept this submission. The prohibition in s 23(1) of the Act is clear: no citizen shall hold residential property on trust for a foreign person. The purpose of s 25 of the Act is equally clear: every foreign person who wishes to purchase or acquire an estate or interest in any residential property must secure prior approval from the Minister. There is no exception in either provision for a foreign person who later acquires Singapore citizenship. The plaintiff’s submission would eviscerate the purpose of these two provisions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The plaintiff submits that it was never the plaintiff’s intention to breach the Act. She points to the fact that she applied for Singapore citizenship in June 2011 and obtained it in December 2011. She also points to the fact that the Property was acquired, not for investment or speculation, but to be a family home. I reject these submissions. The policy of the Act and the purpose of its prohibitions is clear. There is no basis on which I can disregard the effect of the Act on a prohibited estate or interest simply because the beneficiary had no intention to breach the Act or was purchasing the property as a family home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The plaintiff submits that I should interpret the prohibitions in the Act purposively, by analogy with s 51 of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (the “HDB Act”). The case law under the HDB Act has established that, despite the prohibition in s 51 of the HDB Act, an implied trust may arise in favour of a beneficiary if that beneficiary is eligible at the time the implied trust arises to own an interest in an HDB flat (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Poh Soon v Phua Sin Yin </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 583 at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I reject this submission. As the Trustees point out, the HDB Act has a different underlying policy and the prohibition in the HDB Act have different purposes. That is why the case law on the two acts has diverged (see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">V Nithia</span>”) at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The policy of the Act is to prevent foreign persons speculating in a particular class of residential property in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, landed property, and thereby causing the prices of that class of property to rise (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheow Gek and another v Gimly Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 240 at [23]). The purpose of the prohibitions in the Act is to ensure that no such speculation takes place. It is impossible to recognise, as a class, common intention constructive trusts which arises from an express common intention without undermining the policy of the Act and the purpose of the prohibitions in it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The same cannot be said of the HDB Act. The policy of the HDB Act is to regulate the manner by which the HDB provides a home for the owners of an HDB flat and their family members. The purpose of the prohibitions in the HDB Act is to restrict the circumstances in which: (a) the owners of an HDB flat can be put at risk of losing their home and thereby being made homeless; and (b) the owners of an HDB flat can use it otherwise than as a home for themselves and their family members, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, as a home for someone else. It is entirely possible to recognise an implied trust in an HDB flat without undermining the policy of the HDB Act or the purpose of the prohibitions in it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, even on the case law under the HDB Act, a common intention constructive trust which arises from the express intention of the parties is not invariably recognised (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kieuh Huat v Lim Teck Leng and another</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1328 at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For all of these reasons, I hold that the common intention constructive trust which the plaintiff has pleaded and which rests on an express common intention is contrary to s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act and is void under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No proprietary estoppel can arise</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The plaintiff’s alternative claim is for a declaration that the Bankrupt holds 50% of the beneficial interest in the Property for the plaintiff by reason of a proprietary estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act renders void any such proprietary estoppel as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Joshua Steven v Joshua Deborah Steven</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 403, the defendants sought to amend their counterclaim to claim a proprietary estoppel giving them a beneficial interest in a residential property within the scope of the Act. Three of the defendants were foreign persons. Tan Lee Meng J dismissed the application to amend on the basis that the prohibitions in the Act applied to a beneficial interest arising from a proprietary estoppel in the same way it applies to a beneficial interest arising from a trust (at [15]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Three of the … defendants were foreigners when [the residential property] was purchased. As these foreigners did not apply for and were not given any approval to acquire an interest in [the residential property], they cannot hold a beneficial interest in the said property either by means of a trust or an estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff acted with intent to circumvent the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I am also prepared to find that, on the plaintiff’s own primary pleaded case, she acted with intent to circumvent the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 All of the following appears from the plaintiff’s own case as to the Bankrupt’s and her common intention.
