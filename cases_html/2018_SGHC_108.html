</div>
</div> I was of the view that the SFA could operate as a forum mandatory statute, displacing the application of foreign law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Where book-entry securities of a corporation are deposited with the “Depository”, s 81SJ of the SFA deems those named as the depositors in the Depository Register, rather than the Depository, as the members of the corporation. The provision reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Depository not member of company and depositors deemed to be members</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">81SJ.</span>—(1) Notwithstanding anything in the Companies Act (Cap. 50) or any other written law or rule of law or in any instrument or in the constitution of a corporation, where book-entry securities of the corporation are deposited with the Depository or its nominee —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the Depository or its nominee (as the case may be) shall be deemed not to be a member of the corporation; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the persons named as the depositors in a Depository Register shall, for such period as the book-entry securities are entered against their names in the Depository Register, be deemed to be —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) members of the corporation in respect of the amount of book-entry securities (relating to the stocks or shares issued by the corporation) entered against their respective names in the Depository Register; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) holders of the amount of the book-entry securities (relating to the debentures or any derivative instrument) entered against their respective names in the Depository Register.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Section 81SF defines the term “Depository” as the CDP or any other corporation approved by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a depository company or corporation for the purposes of the SFA. “Depository Register” is defined as “a register maintained by the Depository in respect of book-entry securities”. Therefore, by operation of law, those who hold accounts with the CDP in respect of shares in corporations are the members of those corporations, as opposed to the CDP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I was of the view that the SFA could, given its regulatory nature, possibly operate as a forum mandatory statute, as with penal, revenue, and other public laws. Otherwise, the status and rights of a shareholder that holds its shares in a company listed on the Singapore Exchange through the CDP would differ depending on whether the company is incorporated in Singapore or elsewhere. Such a position is counter-intuitive and would likely have unjust effects. The mandatory application of the forum’s laws is recognised as an exception to choice of law. As Prof Richard Fentiman explains in <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Litigation</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) at para 4.06:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The scope of the choice-of-law process is limited to the extent that certain issues are or may be subject to the local law of the forum. The law of the forum will apply directly as the applicable law in three circumstances: where the issue is procedural; where local law is paramount; and where the parties have the option to plead the law of the forum. It may also apply indirectly, insofar as a court may by reason of public policy deny effect to a foreign law that would otherwise apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For the purposes of the injunction application, I was satisfied that it may be found that s 81SJ of the SFA is to be applied as a forum mandatory rule. The language of the provision does not appear to be limited to situations where Singapore law is the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> causae</span>. In the light of this, I thus rejected Noble’s argument that there is no serious question to be tried in OS 480/2018 and also its related submission that the bringing of the injunction application is an abuse of process by Goldilocks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The difficulty in the present case though, as alluded to above at [4], is that at the time of the injunction application, Goldilocks held its shares in Noble through a DBS nominee account, which in turn held the shares through the CDP. The term “depositor” is defined under s 81SF of the SFA as “an account holder or a depository agent but does not include a sub‑account holder”. Goldilocks did not therefore fall squarely within the words of s 81SJ read with s 81SF. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Normally, the court would expect an applicant, particularly one that is represented, to ensure that it meets all the necessary legal requirements for its application. However, I accepted here that the equities of the situation did not require immediate strict compliance with s 81SJ and that the injunction application should not be dismissed on the basis that Goldilocks did not fall squarely within the wording of s 81SJ. I found that it was within Goldilocks’s rights to so register itself as the depositor in respect of its shares in Noble in the CDP register. Following the discussion at the hearing, I directed that Goldilocks, at least, begins the process of such registration by 3 May 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Balance of convenience</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I was satisfied also that the balance of convenience lay in favour of the grant of the injunction. I noted that at least some creditors of Noble may be affected by the delay in the holding of the AGM from the grant of the injunction, and that this may in turn affect the position of Noble, including the timelines for its restructuring. However, I found that this did not override the prejudice to Goldilocks resulting from the denial of its right, as a member, to propose directors and have its nominees voted upon at Noble’s annual general meeting, should OS 480/2018 be determined in Goldilocks’s favour. I did not find any other factor pointing against the grant of the injunction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 For the foregoing reasons, I found that the grant of the interim injunction carried the lower risk of injustice, and so granted the injunction though on modified terms, including a limitation of the scope of the injunction to the holding of Noble’s annual general meeting, as opposed to all shareholders’ meetings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 At a subsequent hearing, I permitted the convening of the AGM only to allow those turning up to be informed that it is to be adjourned, pursuant to the order of court.
