<p>Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The respondent ("Les Placements") was a Canadian company

which entered into a loan agreement ("the Loan Agreement") with a Singapore

company, Wiraco Trading Pte Ltd ("Wiraco"), in 1995. At the time of the Loan

Agreement, the President of Les Placements was one Mr Germain Gauthier

("Germain"). Under the terms of the Agreement, Les Placements was to lend Wiraco

C$350,000 and the appellant ("Hong") gave Les Placements a guarantee to ensure

the repayment of the loan. Wiraco subsequently defaulted in repaying the loan and Les

Placements commenced proceedings against it and Hong in the Superior Court of the District

of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At the trial, Hong alleged that he never guaranteed a loan

from Les Placements to Wiraco. Instead, he claimed that either the guarantee he executed

related to a personal loan from Germain to Wiraco which was never effected, or that the

arrangement was that Germain was to extend a personal loan to him. The thrust of his

defences was therefore that there was no privity of contract between Hong and Les

Placements. The Canadian Court rejected Hong’s defences and held that in relation to

the loan transaction, Germain was not acting for himself but on behalf of Les Placements,

and that the guarantee was addressed to him as the head of Les Placements. It then held

that both Hong and Wiraco were jointly and severally liable to Les Placements for

C$360,645 plus interest and costs. Dissatisfied with this decision, Hong and Wiraco

appealed to the Court of Appeal in Quebec but their appeal was disallowed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Upon obtaining the judgment in Canada, Les Placements commenced a writ

action in Singapore to enforce the Canadian judgment against Hong under common law. It

then applied for, and received, summary judgment in its favour. Hong appealed, arguing

that the Canadian judgment had been obtained by fraud because Les Placements had

fraudulently failed to disclose to the Canadian court that the guarantee was addressed to

Germain and not Les Placements. As such, the Canadian Judgment was not conclusive and that

this was so, even if the defence of fraud had been investigated into by the Canadian court

and rejected. Furthermore, Hong argued that he was entitled to have the issue of fraud

re-litigated in Singapore even if there was no new material before the court supporting

his allegation of fraud. Finally, Hong asserted that there were, in any case, fresh

material to support his allegation: the sworn statements of two witnesses which were

prepared by Les Placements in the Canadian proceedings but were never produced before the

Canadian court. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) A foreign judgment in personam given by a foreign court of

  competent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as

  the foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. Such a foreign

  judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached

  for any error, whether of fact or of law (see ¶¶ 12 – 14); Goddard v Gray (1890)

  L.R. 6 QB 139 and Ralli v Angullia [1915-23] XV SSLR 33 followed. In respect of such an

  action, an application for summary judgment may be made on the ground that the defendant

  has no defence to the claim; Grant v Eaton (1883) 3 QBD 302. A local court will only

  refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment if it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by

  fraud, or if its enforcement would be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in

  which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice (see ¶ 12). </p>
<p align="justify">(2) There were two distinct views as to how a domestic court should

  treat a foreign judgment where fraud was raised in relation to a foreign judgment, the

  English position as enunciated in Abouloff v Oppenheimer (1882) 10 QBD 295 and the

  Canadian-Australian approach laid down in Jacobs v Beaver (1908) 17 OLR 496 and Keele v

  Findley (1991) 21 NSWLR 44. Under the former approach, so long as fraud was alleged, the

  defendant was entitled to reopen the issue of fraud even though no new evidence was

  produced and even though the fraud might have been, and was, alleged in the foreign

  proceedings. The latter approach allowed the examination of the merits of the foreign

  judgment only if extrinsic fraud was alleged or if the defendant had discovered evidence

  of intrinsic fraud after the foreign judgment was passed. The latter approach is

  consistent with the approach taken by courts when facing an allegation of fraud vis-à-vis

  domestic judgments (see ¶¶ 15 - 26). </p>
<p align="justify">(3) The approach adopted in Abouloff had less to commend itself as it

  would only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount importance that there should

  be finality. That said, the rule against re-opening issues is not absolute. As established

  in the body of law governing the re-litigation of issues already adjudicated upon by

  domestic courts, there are exceptions but these are subject to safeguards. There is no

  logical reason why a different rule should apply in relation to a foreign judgment (see ¶

  27). It is also vitally important that no court of one jurisdiction should pass judgment

  on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of another jurisdiction. This is the

  doctrine of comity. After all, two tribunals, both acting conscientiously and diligently,

  could very well come to a different conclusion on the same facts. There is no question of

  which is more correct. To seek to make such an evaluation would be an invidious exercise

  and could lead to the undesirable consequence of encouraging judicial chauvanism. (see ¶

  28).</p>
<p align="justify">(4) On the other hand, the approach taken by the Canadian-Australian

  cases and Ralli v Angullia is preferable since it is more in line with the principles of

  conflict of laws and treats foreign judgments in the same way as domestic judgments. It is

  consonant with the doctrine of comity of nations. It avoids any appearance that this court

  is sitting in an appellate capacity over a final decision of a foreign court. Applying

  this approach, where an allegation of fraud had been considered and adjudicated upon by a

  competent foreign court, the foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud

  only where fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the

  defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a

  difference in the eventual result of the case (see ¶30).</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Hong had objected to the admission of the two sworn statements in

  the Canadian proceedings and now sought to rely on them to show that the Canadian judgment

  was obtained by fraud. He knew of the existence of the statements and of what the two

  persons stated therein. There was therefore no new evidence of fraud (see ¶ 32). In any

  case, even if the statements were admitted in the Canadian proceedings, they would not

  have made a difference to the court’s verdict since they did not really indicate that

  there was any evidence of fraud. On the contrary, Hong’s actions led to an

  irrefutable inference that there was no fraud and that he had in fact agreed to guarantee

  the loan from Les Placements to Wiraco.</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    This was an appeal by the defendant (Hong) against a

decision of the High Court granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs (Les Placements) on

the latter’s claim based on a judgment obtained in Canada. Hong argued that, having

raised the point that the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud, that should suffice to

preclude the judgment from being enforced in Singapore, and that the action should be

allowed to go on for trial to enable Hong to establish the alleged fraud. We were not

persuaded by Hong’s contention and dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">2.    The facts giving rise to the action were largely as follows. Les

Placements was a company incorporated in Canada. On or about 25 April 1995, it entered

into a loan agreement (‘the Loan Agreement’) with Wiraco Trading Pte Ltd

(‘Wiraco’), a company incorporated in Singapore, whereby Les Placements agreed

to lend Wiraco a sum of C$350,000. At the time of the loan, the President of Les

Placements was one Mr Germain Gauthier (‘Germain’) and his son, Pierre Gauthier

(‘Pierre’), was a shareholder and the managing director of Wiraco. Hong’s

wife was also a director of Wiraco. As a part of the loan arrangement, Hong gave a

guarantee to Les Placement to ensure the repayment of the loan extended by Les Placements

to Wiraco.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Under clause 12.1 of the Loan Agreement it was provided that the

courts of the province of Quebec as well as the Supreme Court of Canada shall have the

exclusive jurisdiction with respect to all disputes relating thereto.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    On the due date, Wiraco defaulted in repaying the loan. Despite

demands, both Wiraco and Hong failed to fulfil their repayment obligations. Thus, Les

Placements commenced proceedings against Wiraco and Hong in the Superior Court of the

District of Montreal, Quebec, Canada pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    Hong disputed the jurisdiction of the Canadian Court and sought a

stay on the ground of forum non conveniens. That challenge was rejected. The action went

on for trial and Hong alleged that he never guaranteed a loan from Les Placements to

Wiraco. Instead, he claimed that the guarantee he executed related to a personal loan from

Germain to Wiraco which was never effected. In the alternative, Hong contended that the

arrangement was that Germain was to extend a personal loan to him and that the guarantee

was for Germain’s benefit and not Les Placements. These defences were raised with a

view to having the claim dismissed on the ground that there was no privity of contract

between Hong and Les Placements.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    The Canadian Court held that in relation to the loan transaction

Germain was not acting for himself but on behalf of his company, Les Placements, and that

the guarantee was addressed to him as the head of Les Placements. The defences raised were

therefore rejected and both Hong and Wiraco were held to be jointly and severally liable

to Les Placements for C$360,645.00, plus interest and costs. Dissatisfied with this

decision, Hong and Wiraco appealed to the Court of Appeal in Quebec but the appeal was

disallowed.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    As Canada was not a country gazetted under either the Reciprocal

Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264) (‘RECJA’) or the Reciprocal

Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 295) ("REFJA"), Les Placements had to

commence a Writ action in Singapore to enforce the Canadian judgment against Hong under

common law. Thus, the present proceeding. No enforcement action was taken by Les Placement

against Wiraco because the latter was in liquidation. </p>
<p xmlns="">8.    Following the institution of the action in Singapore, an

application was made to obtain summary judgment, which led to the statement of claim being

amended and re-amended and a fresh application for summary judgment made. On 4 May 2001

the Senior Assistant Registrar granted unconditional leave to defend to Hong. On further

appeal to the High Court, Les Placements successfully obtained a summary judgment from

Choo Han Teck JC. Being dissatisfied, Hong appealed to this court.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    Before Choo JC, counsel for Hong made the following arguments in

so far as they were germane to this appeal. First, Les Placements was not entitled to

summary judgment on the strength of the Canadian judgment unless the ‘underlying

basis’ of the foreign judgment is pleaded and tried in the Singapore courts. Second,

the Canadian judgment was improperly obtained because Les Placements had fraudulently

failed to disclose to the Canadian court that the guarantee of 20 March 1995 was addressed

to Germain Gautier and not Les Placements. On both points, Hong failed. The court held

that it was an established principle that a judgment obtained from a competent foreign

jurisdiction, which was final and conclusive on the merits, was also generally conclusive

in Singapore between the same parties.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Appeal</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">10.    Before us, Hong reiterated the point about the Canadian judgment

being obtained by fraud. He submitted that, where fraud was raised, the foreign judgment

could no longer be conclusive and this was so even if the defence of fraud had been

investigated into by the foreign court and rejected. Furthermore, he was entitled to have

the issue of fraud re-litigated in Singapore even if there was no new material. However he

conceded that leave to defend would be refused, if it was obvious that the allegation of

fraud was frivolous, citing <i>Codd v Delap</i> [1905] 92 LT 510. He argued that the court

below should not have followed the decision in <i>Ralli v Angullia </i>[1915-23] XV SSLR 33.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    Hong further asserted that there were fresh materials to support

the allegation of fraud: the sworn statements of two witnesses (Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok

Lee) which were prepared by Les Placements in the Canadian proceedings but were never

produced before the Canadian court.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Principles governing foreign judgments</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">12.    Quite apart from the arrangements under the RECJA or the REFJA,

it is settled law that a foreign judgment <i>in personam</i> given by a foreign court of

competent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as

the foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. The foreign

judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached

for any error, whether of fact or of law: <i>Goddard v Gray</i> (1890) L.R. 6 QB 139. In

respect of such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made on the ground

that the defendant has no defence to the claim: <i>Grant v Eaton</i> (1883) 3 QBD 302. The

local court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment if it is shown that the

plaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its enforcement would be contrary to public policy

or if the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice:

see ¶¶ 1008-1010 of Vol 8(1) of <i>Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4<sup>th</sup> Edn

(Re-issue)</i>. </p>
<p xmlns="">13.    In a much earlier case, <i>Vanquelin v Bouard</i> 15 C.B.N.S 341

which was an action in England on a French judgment, Erle CJ, said:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"It has been well settled that defences which might have been

  raised in the foreign court cannot be brought forward here for the purpose of setting

  aside the judgment."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">14.    The rule established in <i>Goddard v Gray</i> was followed in the

local case, <i>Ralli v Angullia,</i> supra, a 1917 decision of the Court of Appeal of the

Straits Settlements (the predecessor of this Court). One of the issues determined by the

court there was that a foreign judgment was conclusive as to any matter adjudicated upon

and could not be impeached for any error of fact or law in an action based on it, apart

from special grounds. A defence which might have been raised in the foreign court and was

not raised could not be raised in the forum of enforcement. Woodward J, who delivered the

leading judgment, even suggested that the foreign judgment created a new and independent

obligation distinct from the original cause of action. But he recognised that the exact

nature of the obligation still remained unsettled and, in his words, "it may be that

there is no merger, because the original cause of action still subsists, but the

obligation created by the judgment is nevertheless a new one." </p>
<p xmlns="">15.    However, there is a line of authorities starting with <i>Abouloff

v Oppenheimer</i> (1882) 10 QBD 295 which seemed to say that so long as fraud is alleged

the defendant is thereby entitled to reopen the issue of fraud. This decision considerably

extended the fraud exception to the conclusive rule enunciated in <i>Goddard v Gray</i>.

In <i>Abouloff</i>, the Court of Appeal held that a foreign judgment could be impeached

for fraud even though no new evidence was produced and even though the fraud might have

been, and was, alleged in the foreign proceedings. The Court sought to justify its

approach allowing re-opening of the fraud issue by stating that the foreign court would

not have itself approved of being misled and permit a judgment so obtained to remain.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    In the later case <i>Vadala v Lawes</i> (1890) 25 QBD 310, while

the Court of Appeal recognised the problems posed as a result of the decision in <i>Abouloff</i>,

it nevertheless refused to depart from it. Lindley LJ observed (at 316-7) "if the

fraud upon the foreign court consists in the fact that the plaintiff has induced that

court by fraud to come to a wrong conclusion, you can re-open the whole case even though

you will have in this court to go into the very fact which were investigated and which

were in issue in the foreign court."</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    It was again reaffirmed in the recent case <i>Jet Holdings Inc v

Patel</i> [1989] 2 All ER 648, where Staughton LJ stated:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"It is to my mind plain that the foreign court’s decision on

  its own jurisdiction is neither conclusive nor relevant. If the foreign court has no

  jurisdiction in the eyes of English law, any conclusion it may have reached as to its own

  jurisdiction is of no value. To put it bluntly, if not vulgarly, the foreign court cannot

  haul itself up by its own bootstraps. Logically, the same reasoning must apply where

  enforcement is resisted on the ground of fraud. … If the rule is that a foreign

  judgment obtained by fraud is not enforceable, it cannot matter that in the view of the

  foreign court there was no fraud. But this doctrine makes a great inroad into the

  objective, which is generally desirable, of enforcing foreign judgments where in the eyes

  of English law the foreign court has jurisdiction. The defendant may have been served in

  the foreign country, entered an appearance, given evidence, been disbelieved and had

  judgment entered against him. If he asserts that the plaintiff’s claim and evidence

  were fraudulent that issue must be tried all over again in enforcement proceedings. The

  lesson for the plaintiff is that he should in the first place bring the action where he

  expects to be able to enforce a judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">The doctrine has encountered criticism from academic writers: see <i>Dicey

  and Morris</i> p. 469, footnote 66. A possible view which is taken by some is that the

  fraud relied on must be extraneous or collateral to the dispute which the foreign court

  determines. But in my judgment <i>it is a hundred years too late for this court to take

  that view</i>. The decisions in <i>Abouloff v Oppenheimer &amp; Co</i> (1882) 10 QBD 295,

  [1881-5] All Er Rep 307 and <i>Vadala v Lawes</i> (1890) 25 QBD 310, [1886-90] All ER Rep

  853 show that a foreign judgment cannot be enforced if it was obtained by fraud, even

  though the allegation of fraud was investigated and rejected by the foreign court."

  [Emphasis added].</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">18.    In <i>Syal v Heyward</i> [1948] 2 KB 443 the Court of Appeal,

applying <i>Abouloff</i>, held it to be immaterial that the facts relied upon to establish

a prima facie case of fraud were known to the party relying on them at all material times

and could thus have been raised by way of defence in the foreign proceedings.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    We must, however, point out that the approach adopted in <i>Abouloff</i>

is completely inconsistent with that adopted by the English court vis-à-vis its own

domestic judgments. This is elucidated clearly in the following passage from <i>Dicey

&amp; Morris on Conflict of Laws (13<sup>th</sup> Edn)</i> at pp 518-9:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"A party against whom an English judgment has been given may bring

  an independent action to set aside the judgment on the ground that it was obtained by

  fraud; but this is subject to very stringent safeguards, which have been found necessary

  because otherwise there would be no end to litigation and no solemnity in judgments. The

  most important of these safeguards is that the second action will be summarily dismissed

  unless the claimant can produce evidence newly discovered since the trial, which evidence

  could not have been produced at the trial with reasonable diligence, and which is so

  material that its production at the trial would probably have affected the result, and

  (when the fraud consists of perjury) so strong that it would reasonably be expected to be

  decisive at the rehearing and if unanswered must have that result. But it does not matter

  whether the fraud is extrinsic, e.g., consists in bribing witnesses, or intrinsic, e.g.,

  consists in giving or procuring of perjured or forged evidence."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">20.    In contrast, the Canadian courts declined to follow <i>Abouloff</i>.

In <i>Jacobs v Beaver</i> (1908) 17 OLR 496, Garrow JA of the Ontario Court of Appeal

offered the following critique of <i>Abouloff</i> and <i>Valada</i> (at p.505):- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"It can be matter of little wonder that there should be a

  hesitation to accept as law all the dicta contained in the judgment in <i>Abouloff v

  Oppenheimer</i>, where the consequences so well pointed out by Hargaty, C.J. in <i>Woodruff

  v McLennan</i>, are or may be to practically abrogate the whole doctrine of <i>res

  judicata </i>both as to native and foreign judgments. A doctrine so useful and so well

  established, resting not alone upon a consideration of the private convenience of

  litigants, but upon the broader foundation of public policy, should, one would think,

  require more for its abrogation than the mere dicta of one or even more Judges, here or

  elsewhere, however eminent.</p>
<i><p align="justify">Abouloff v Oppenheimer</p></i> was followed in <i>Vadala v Lawes</i>, 25

  QBD 310. But the judgment rests not upon the actual decision in the former case, but upon

  the dicta to which I have referred. Early in the judgment of Lindley, LJ, appears this

  statement, p. 316: "There are two rules relating to these matters which have to be

  borne in mind, and the joint operation of which gives rise to the difficulty. First of all

  there is the rule, which is perfectly well established and well known, that a party to an

  action can impeach the judgment for fraud. Whether it is the judgment of an English Court

  or of a foreign Court does not matter, using general language, there is a general

  proposition unconditional and undisputed. Another general proposition which, speaking in

  equally general language, is perfectly well settled, is that when you bring an action on a

  foreign judgment you cannot go into the merits which have been tried in the foreign Court,

  but you have to combine these two rules and apply them in the case where you cannot go

  into the alleged fraud without going into the merits. Which rule is to prevail? That point

  appears to have been one of great difficulty before the case of <i>Abouloff v Oppenheimer</i>

  ... But until the <i>Abouloff</i> case the difficulty of combining the two rules and

  saying what ought to be done, where you could not enter into the question of fraud to

  prove it without re-opening the merits, had never come forward for explicit decision. <i>That

  point was raised directly</i> in the case of <i>Abouloff v Oppenheimer</i>, and it was

  decided. I cannot fritter away that judgment," etc.

  <p align="justify">With the greatest deference, it seems to me that this statement is open

  to two serious objections: (1) it in no way takes account of or defines <i>the nature</i>

  of the fraud which can be successfully opposed to a judgment, whether native or foreign,

  for it is admitted the rule is the same, and (2) the point was not explicitly raised in <i>Abouloff

  v Oppenheimer</i>, where the facts were all admitted by the demurrer.</p>
<p align="justify">The combination of the two rules, with which no one quarrels, is made

  easy and without the reproach of any thing like hairsplitting, if my first objection is

  answered, as I think it should be, in the line of authorities which no one can question,

  namely, that the fraud relied on must be something collateral or extraneous, and not

  merely the fraud which is imputed from alleged false statements made at the trial, which

  were met by counter-statements by the other side, and the whole adjudicated upon by the

  Court and so passed on into the limbo of estoppel by the judgment. This estoppel cannot,

  in my opinion, be disturbed except upon the allegation and proof of new and material

  facts, or newly discovered and material facts which were not before the former Court and

  from which are to be deduced the new proposition that the former judgment was obtained by

  fraud. The burden of that issue is upon the defendant, and until he at least gives <i>prima

  facie</i> evidence in support of it; the estoppel stands."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">21.    What Garron JA advocated was that a court should only look into

the merits of a foreign judgment if extrinsic fraud was alleged or if the defendant had

discovered evidence of intrinsic fraud after the foreign judgment was passed. And what

would constitute extrinsic fraud was elaborated in the earlier Ontario Court of Appeal

decision in <i>Woodruff v McLennan</i> (1887) 14 OAR 242 as being:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"the defendant had never been served with process, that the suit

  had been undefended without defendant’s default, that the defendant had been

  fraudulently persuaded by plaintiff to let judgment go by default … or some fraud to

  defendant’s prejudice committed or allowed in the proceedings of the other

  court."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">22.    The approach advocated by Garrow JA was followed by the courts of

several other provinces in Canada, e.g., Nova Scotia in <i>Manolopoulos v Pnaiffe</i>

[1930] 2 DLR 169; Alberta in <i>Union of India v Bumber Development Corp</i> [1995] 7 W.W.R 80; and British Columbia in <i>Roglass Consultants Inc v Kennedy Lock &amp; Willet

Inc</i> (1984) 65 BCLR 393.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    In Australia, the courts there also seem to be moving away from <i>Abouloff</i>.

The leading case would appear to be <i>Keele v Findley</i> (1991) 21 NSWLR 444 where the

NSW Commercial Division preferred the Canadian approach. Rogers CJ (NSW) held that fraud

was a defence to an action on a foreign judgment only if there had been a new discovery of

material evidence which would establish fraud and make it reasonably probable that the

opposite result would have been reached. He felt that the current English position came

about because the courts had failed to take proper account of the developments in the law

relating to domestic judgments.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    However, notwithstanding these Canadian and Australian

authorities, the English Court of Appeal reaffirmed the ruling in <i>Abouloff</i> in <i>Owens

Bank Ltd v Bracco</i> [1991] 4 AER 833 and held that, as far as fraud was concerned, the

enforcement of a foreign judgment was not the same as the enforcement of an English

judgment in that there was no requirement of any fresh evidence before an English court

could try the issue of fraud. This Court of Appeal decision was affirmed by the House of

Lords where Lord Bridge, with whom the other Law Lords concurred, stated that if the law

were in need of reform, it was for the legislature, not the judiciary, to effect it. While

<i>Bracco</i> involved enforcement under the Administration of Justice Act 1920, the House

felt that the word "fraud" in the Act should be given the same sense as in

common law.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    Interestingly, in this regard, there is a Court of Appeal case

which sought to limit the scope of the <i>Abouloff</i> line of cases: <i>House of Spring

Gardens Ltd v Waite</i> [1991] 1 QB 241. <i>Waite</i> concerned two Irish judgments where

in the original judgment (given in 1983 and on which enforcement was sought), the issue of

fraud was canvassed and decided upon and the same issue of fraud was also examined in a

separate and second action in Ireland (in 1987). The Court held that it was the judgment

in the second action which created the estoppel. In seeking to distinguish the situation

there from the other cases, Stuart-Smith LJ stated:- 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In none of these cases was the question, whether the judgment

  sued upon here was obtained by fraud, litigated in a separate and second action in the

  foreign jurisdiction."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">26.    In the alternative, the court in <i>Waite</i> felt that it would

amount to an abuse of process to allow the defendant to re-litigate the issue. But the

court also noted that the result would have been different and the question of whether

there had been fraud re-examined if it had been possible to impeach the 1987 judgment on

the basis that the judgment had itself been obtained by fraud or to produce new evidence

of fraud in relation to the earlier judgment.</p>

Our approach</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">27.    There were, therefore, before us, two distinct views as to how a

domestic court should treat a foreign judgment where fraud is raised in relation to that

foreign judgment. One is that enunciated in <i>Abouloff</i> and the other advocated by the

Canadian-Australian cases which sought to limit the circumstances under which a domestic

court may re-open an issue already determined by a foreign judgment including an

allegation of fraud. In our judgment the approach adopted in <i>Abouloff</i> has less to

commend itself as it would only encourage endless litigation. It is of paramount

importance that there should be finality. Every losing party understandably would like to

litigate the issue over again with the hope that a different tribunal would look at the

fact situation differently. But that can never be a good reason for allowing a losing

party to re-open issues. To liberally allow a party to do so would be to permit that party

to have a second bite at the cherry, an eventuality which is generally abhorred by all

civilized systems of law. Of course, we are conscious that the rule against re-opening

issues is not absolute. There are exceptions but they are subject to safeguards. In

England, an issue already adjudicated upon by the domestic courts would not, as a rule, be

allowed to be re-litigated. There is no logical reason why a different rule should apply

in relation to a foreign judgment.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    It is also vitally important that no court of one jurisdiction

should pass judgment on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of another

jurisdiction. This is the doctrine of comity. After all, two tribunals, both acting

conscientiously and diligently, could very well come to a different conclusion on the same

facts. There is no question of which is being more correct. To seek to make such an

evaluation would be an invidious exercise and could lead to the undesirable consequence

which we have mentioned before of encouraging judicial chauvanism. It must be borne in

mind that the enforcement forum is not an appellate tribunal vis-à-vis the foreign

judgment. </p>
<p xmlns="">29.    We note here that in <i>Owens Bank Ltd v Etoile Commerciale SA </i>[1995] 1 WLR 44, Lord Templemen, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council observed that it

did not "regard the decision in <i>Abouloff</i> … with enthusiasm." In <i>Etoile

Commerciale</i> the Privy Council adopted the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <i>Waite</i>

rather than that in <i>Abouloff</i>.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    In our judgment, the approach taken by the Canadian-Australian

cases and <i>Ralli v Angullia</i> is more in line with principles of conflict of laws and

treats foreign judgments in the same way as domestic judgments. It is consonant with the

doctrine of comity of nations. It avoids any appearance that this court is sitting in an

appellate capacity over a final decision of a foreign court. We, therefore, ruled that

where an allegation of fraud had been considered and adjudicated upon by a competent

foreign court, the foreign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where

fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant

would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a

difference in the eventual result of the case. There is no necessity for us to offer any

views on the jurisprudential question whether a foreign judgment created a new and

independent obligation distinct from that of the underlying or original cause of action,

raised by Woodward J in <i>Ralli v Angullia</i>.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    This common law principle of according finality to a foreign

judgment was at one time thought to be based on the doctrine of comity. English judges

then believed that the law of nations required the courts of one country to assist those

of any other and they feared that if foreign judgments were not enforced in England,

English judgments would not be enforced abroad: <i>Roach v Garvan</i> (1748) 1 Ves Sen 157

at 159. However, this theory seems to have given way to what is known as the doctrine of

obligations, namely, that the foreign judgment imposes a duty or obligation on the

defendant to pay the judgment sum which the courts in the enforcement country are bound to

enforce: <i>Schibsby v Westenholz</i> (1870) LR 6QB 155 at 159. Whatever may be the

correct legal foundation, or for that matter it could be a combination of both, the

cardinal principle is that no one court should sit in judgment over the final decision of

a competent court of another jurisdiction. A party, litigating in a foreign court, must

diligently muster all the evidence and raise all pertinent issues in that forum. He should

not have any expectation that any carelessness or omission on his part could nevertheless

be made good in the forum of enforcement.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Fresh evidence of fraud</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">32.    As stated before, the fresh evidence alleged by Hong were the two

sworn statements of Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok Lee. According to Les Placements it was Hong

who objected to the admissibility of the two sworn statements and prevented them from

being admitted in the Canadian proceedings. Yet in the proceedings here, he sought to rely

on them to show that the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud. He should not be allowed

to blow hot and cold. He knew of the existence of the statements and of what the two

persons stated therein. It was too late for Hong to change his mind now. There was,

therefore, no new evidence.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    That should dispose of this appeal. But we would go further and

say that even if the two statements were admitted in the Canadian proceedings, it would

not have made a difference to the court’s verdict. In their statements, both Chew Kia

Lee and Yeo Seok Lee stated that the loan of C$350,000 was from Germain to Wiraco. But one

critical uncontrovertible piece of evidence before the Canadian court was that the sum of

C$350,000 was transferred from Les Placements to Wiraco. It might well be that Pierre told

Chew that the money was from Germain without distinguishing Pierre’s father’s

company from his father. Similarly, when Yeo heard Hong suggesting that Pierre borrow

money from Germain, Hong did not distinguish Pierre from Wiraco. It was never suggested

that Pierre himself wanted to borrow from his father. It was probably understood by all

that Wiraco was borrowing from Les Placements. In conversations, such a manner of

reference is often present. Quite clearly, the evidence of Chew Kia Lee and Yeo Seok Lee

would not prove anything to the contrary. More importantly, why did Hong sign the Loan

Agreement if he had not intended to guarantee the loan from Les Placements to Wiraco? It

is true that the Loan Agreement was in French. Les Placements claimed that it was orally

interpreted to Hong. While Hong disputed this, he did not explain why he, a former

principal of Price Waterhouse and therefore a person experienced in business, would have

signed a document he did not understand. At the very least, he would have seen from the

Loan Agreement that the agreement was between Les Placements and Wiraco. In any case, he

had also provided no reason for signing the Extension Agreement. The irrefutable inference

was that there was no fraud and Hong in fact agreed to guarantee the loan from Les

Placements to Wiraco. His claim that there was fraud was without merit.</p>
