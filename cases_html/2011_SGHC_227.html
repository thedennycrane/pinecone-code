<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Assessment of Damages against the Defendant,
                    Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd, was pursuant to Lai Siu Chiu J’s
                    decision on liability given on 5 June 2009. Interlocutory Judgment was duly
                    entered in favour of the plaintiff, Yip Holdings Pte Ltd, on its claim with
                    costs, and damages were directed to be assessed by the Registrar with costs of
                    the assessment reserved to the Registrar (see <em>Yip Holdings
                        Pte Ltd v Asia Link Marine Industries Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 136 (“<em>Yip Holdings v Asia
                        Link</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts giving rise to these proceedings may
                    be briefly stated as follows. The plaintiff in Suit No 399 of 2008 claimed
                    damages for breach of contract in relation to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, damage caused to the plaintiff’s American Hoist 9280
                    crane (“the Crane”) that was kept at the defendant’s
                    premises pursuant to an oral agreement made in 1999 (see <em>Yip
                        Holdings v Asia Link</em> at [107] for the terms). The defendant
                    admitted that on 17 February 2007, the plaintiff had requested access to
                    the Crane in order to facilitate its removal, and that the defendant had
                    instructed the Crane to be moved to another yard belonging to Haruki Machinery
                    Pte Ltd (“Haruki”). Lai J found that the Crane was unilaterally
                    moved from the defendant’s premises to another location on 18 April 2007,
                    that the plaintiff had no prior knowledge of the defendant’s instructions
                    to Haruki, and that the defendant did not inform the plaintiff that the Crane
                    had been moved to another location until 7 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Haruki had demobilised and dismantled the Crane
                    purportedly to carry out repairs to the Crane at No 48 Tuas Avenue 9, Singapore
                    (“Haruki’s yard”). From what had been stated, the
                    dismantling of the Crane involved taking out various parts of the Crane.
                    However, repairs were never carried out. Instead, the defendant left the Crane
                    in the open in its dismantled state at Haruki’s yard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s managing director and
                    major shareholder who testified at the trial was Yip Fook Chong also known as
                    Ronald Yip (“Yip”). The defendant’s director and shareholder
                    who testified on behalf of the defendant was Lim Seong Ong also known as Kenny
                    Lim (“Lim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of Lai Siu Chiu J</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I refer to the trial judge’s finding of
                    facts and legal conclusions on the liability issue in <em>Yip
                        Holdings v Asia Link</em>. The paragraphs that are relevant to the
                    assessment of recoverable damages are set out hereunder:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102    I found Lim’s explanation as to why he
                            refused Yip permission for [Triple Gem International Pte Ltd
                            (“Triple Gem”)] to move the [Crane] out from the yard
                            utterly incredible. As it was the plaintiff and not the defendant which
                            owned the [Crane], it was of no concern to the defendant whether the
                            removal from the yard was done by a qualified or unqualified crane
                            contractor. It would be the plaintiff and not the defendant who would
                            bear the consequences should it be found that the moving needed to be
                            done by an approved contractor on MOM’s list.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104    As the plaintiff rightly pointed out in its
                            closing submissions [at para 11(b)], Yip responded as expeditiously as
                            possible when Lim demanded that the [Crane] be removed by 2 January
                            2007. On 17 February 2007, the plaintiff was ready to move the
                            [Crane] to the premises of Triple Gem but was denied access to the yard
                            by Lim. Lim failed to respond to Yip’s letter dated
                            17 February 2007 in [30]. After his unilateral move of the [Crane]
                            on 18 April 2007, Lim still did not inform Yip/the plaintiff of the move
                            until 7 May 2007. It is my view that the only reason Lim was
                            prompted to respond was due to his receipt of the letter dated
                            3 May 2007 from the plaintiff’s solicitors in [33] which was
                            carbon-copied to Jurong Police station, after Yip had lodged a police
                            report on Lim’s attempt to move the [Crane] out of Haruki’s
                            yard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105    What made the defendant’s/Lim’s
                            conduct even more reprehensible was the fact that Lim had engaged Haruki
                            who were not a qualified contractor for the make of the [Crane], to
                            dismantle and disassemble [Crane]. Judging by subsequent events, Haruki
                            not only damaged the [Crane] in the process but seemed incapable of
                            assembling and/or restoring the [Crane] to its original
                        state.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    Lim acted to all intents and purposes as if he was
                            the owner of the [Crane] to the extent that he denied Yip access to the
                            [Crane] while it was in the yard. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">109    ...I accepted the plaintiff’s submission
                            that the defendant breached the oral agreement when it unilaterally
                            moved the [Crane] out of the yard without the prior knowledge or consent
                            of the plaintiff and against the plaintiff’s express request to
                            have the move carried out by its appointed contractor, Triple
                            Gem.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110    It would not even be necessary to consider the
                            plaintiff’s submissions on the necessary terms to be implied into
                            the oral agreement as Lim himself had admitted (at N/E 169-170) that he
                            needed to inform the owner should any equipment stored in the yard be
                            relocated to another area and, when questioned by the court, he agreed
                            that he would be liable should any damage result from such a move (see
                            [93] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">111    Consequently, the [Crane] having been damaged when
                            it was moved and/or after it was moved, from the yard to Haruki’s
                            yard on the instructions of Lim, the defendant was liable for the damage
                            caused thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">113    There can be little
                            doubt that the present deplorable condition of the [Crane] was entirely
                            attributable to Haruki’s dismantling and disassembling of the
                            [Crane]. In the words of Spencer (at N/E 98) the condition of the
                            [Crane] was near scrap value. Spencer’s view was confirmed by none
                            other than the defendant’s own witness Razak (at para 8.03 of his
                            report) when he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The [Crane] had deteriorated to such a state it might not be
                            economical to repair to bring it back to original working
                            condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The undisputed facts as narrated by Lai J
                    in <em>Yip Holdings v Asia Link</em> are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the
                            defendant on 28 May 2007 to say the latter had breached its
                            obligations to safeguard the [Crane]. Despite the plaintiff’s
                            various efforts to recover the [Crane], the defendant refused to respond
                            to the plaintiff’s request to repair and reassemble the crane into
                            working condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    At the same time as the plaintiff/its solicitors
                            were corresponding with the defendant, the plaintiff requested Haruki to
                            give a list of replacements to put the [Crane] into fully operational
                            condition. The plaintiff was anxious to rebuild the [Crane] as soon as
                            possible so that it could rent it out or sell it off as at that time,
                            the construction industry was booming in both Asia and the Middle East
                            with a corresponding high demand for big heavy cranes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Haruki did give the plaintiff an estimate but it
                            failed to take any steps to rebuild the [Crane] leaving the
                            [Crane’s] components exposed to the elements. Notwithstanding
                            Haruki’s inaction, Yip let the market know that the plaintiff had
                            a 150 ton lifting capacity crane which was available for rent or
                            sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    Between 7 May 2007 and 7 December 2007, the
                            plaintiff received inquiries from three interested parties either to buy
                            or to rent the crane. One offer was from an Indian party (at
                            US$400,000), another from Malaysia (also at US$400,000) and the third
                            offer was from Haruki itself whose offer was $300,000 on an “as
                            is where is” basis. The first two interested parties required the
                            [Crane] to be rebuilt to its fully operational condition. Unfortunately,
                            the plaintiff was unable to accept either the first or second offers
                            (Yip rejected Haruki’s offer) because of Haruki’s inaction
                            on the repair works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    Subsequently, Haruki renewed its offer to the
                            plaintiff after the Malaysian buyer withdrew its offer. On 7 December
                            2008, the plaintiff’s solicitors received an offer from
                            Haruki’s solicitors of $300,000 for the [Crane]. The offer
                            required the plaintiff as well as Yip to given an indemnity. Yip
                            rejected the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Assistant Registrar’s Order of 15 September 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s Notice of Assessment of
                    Damages, namely, NA 18 of 2008/W (“NA 18”) was listed for hearing
                    before an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) over several tranches. The
                    AR’s decision on the quantum of damages recoverable was given on
                    15 September 2010 (“the Order of 15 September 2010”). In
                    particular, the AR awarded:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Damage to the Crane at
                        US$285,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Loss
                        of chance of rental at US$48,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Cost of torque converter at US$6,000;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Outstanding
                        amount on the Manitowoc crane at S$65,715.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The AR also awarded interest at 5.33% per annum
                    from the date of the Writ of Summons to the date of assessment with costs of the
                    assessment fixed at S$53,000 excluding disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Both parties were dissatisfied with the quantum
                    of damages assessed by the AR and Notices of Appeal to Judge in Chambers were
                    filed. RA No 389 of 2010/J (“RA 389”) was filed by the Defendant
                    and the scope of the appeal related to items (a) and (b) of the AR’s Order
                    of 15 September 2010 (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). RA
                    No 391 of 2010/E (“RA 391”) was filed by the plaintiff, and the
                    appeal also related to items (a) and (b). In short, both parties did not appeal
                    against items (c) and (d) of the Order of 15 September 2010. At the
                    conclusion of the hearing, I made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant to pay the plaintiff
                        the sum of US$395,000 (equivalent to S$516,265) being the value of the Crane
                        after deducting the sum of US$5,000. The defendant is to take over the
                        plaintiff’s proprietary interest in the Crane “as is, where
                        is”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     No
                        damages for loss of rental;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     No damages for loss of chance to rent out the Crane;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     Each party
                        to bear its own costs of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I informed counsel at the hearing on
                    20 April 2011 that I would use the AR’s exchange rate of US$1 =
                        S$1.307.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> For
                    the plaintiff’s loss of the Crane being the value of the Crane, the amount
                    of damages awarded in US Dollars was US$395,000 after deducting US$5,000. I was
                    informed by Ms Jacob that in Singapore dollars, the quantum of damages
                    would be S$516,265 (US$395,000 x S$1.307).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Given the scope of the defendant’s
                    appeal, I will only be publishing the reasons for my decision to award the sum
                    of US$395,000 as damages to the plaintiff for the destruction of its
                    Crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal principles for assessment in this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     To recap, the breaches were that the defendant
                    had refused to allow the plaintiff to take away the Crane between
                    17 February and 30 March 2007, and thereafter the defendant failed to,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, safeguard the Crane in
                    Haruki’s yard. In April 2007, without the consent and authorisation of the
                    plaintiff, the defendant unilaterally gave instructions to Haruki (acting on
                    behalf of the defendant) to dismantle and move the crane to the latter’s
                    yard which instructions were acted upon by Haruki. In the process of the move,
                    the Crane, in its dismantled state, was damaged on 18 April 2007. The Crane
                    was not reassembled and its condition deteriorated over time as it was left in
                    the open at Haruki’s yard with its components exposed to the elements.
                    Under these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to <em>restitution</em> in <em>integrum</em>. As Andrew
                    Burrows in <em>Remedies for Torts and Breach of
                        Contract</em> (Oxford University Press, 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Ed, 2004) (“<em>Remedies for Torts and Breach of
                        Contract</em>”) observed (at 232):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether for torts or breach of contract, the general compensatory aims
                        dictate that the claimant should be put into as good a position as if its
                        property had not been damaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the context of the present case, how this
                    general compensatory principle is to be applied will depend on whether the
                    chattel was damaged or destroyed. In the case of damage to property, the amount
                    by which the value of the chattel is diminished is usually equated with the cost
                    of repair. Alternatively, if the damaged chattel is owned for use, the measure
                    of damages would be the cost of replacement of a similar chattel and loss of
                    use. However, where the chattel has been destroyed or is a constructive total
                    loss in the sense that it would be uneconomic to repair, the <em>prima facie</em> measure of damages is the value of the chattel at
                    the time and place of destruction, plus any other consequential losses (see
                        <em>The Liesbosch</em> [1933] AC 449 at 464, per Lord
                    Wright and <em>Butterworth’s Common Law Series, The Law of
                        Damages</em>, (LexisNexis, 2010, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed)
                        (“<em>Butterworth’s Law of
                    Damages</em>”) Chapter 14, paras 14.01 and 14.02).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as the
                    party seeking to establish its entitlement to damages. As for the degree of
                    proof required in respect of the loss claimed, I refer to and adopt the apt
                    words of Andrew Grubb in <em>The Law of Torts</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed at para 6.5) where the author,
                    rightly, observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is not possible to say more than that the claimant must prove his
                        damage with as much degree of particularity as is required in the
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The impossibility of laying down any
                    definitive rule as to what may constitute adequate proof of damage means that a
                    court has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to the proof of damage. This
                    approach was fully explained by Andrew Phang JA in <em>Robertson
                        Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 623 (“<em>Robertson
                    Quay</em>”). The decision at [27] –
                    [28] and [30] –
                    [31] is particularly instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    ... [I]t is
                            fundamental and trite that a plaintiff claiming damages must prove his
                            damage. ... The process of proving damage is an intensely factual one
                            ... . In the circumstances, it is impossible to lay down any <em>general</em> rules or principles as to what
                            constitutes adequate proof of damages since the <em>particular</em> factual circumstances can take, literally, a
                            myriad of forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The law,
                            however, does not demand that the plaintiff prove with complete
                            certainty the exact amount of damage that he has suffered. Thus, the
                            learned author of <em>McGregor on Damages</em>
                            continues as follows (at para 8-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the
                            fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage
                            is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As
                            Vaughan Williams L.J. put it in Chaplin v Hicks [[1911] 2 KB 786], the
                            leading case on the issue of certainty: “The fact that damages
                            cannot be assessed with certainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the
                            necessity of paying damages.” Indeed if absolute certainty were
                            required as to the precise amount of loss that the claimant had
                            suffered, no damages would be recovered at all in the great number of
                            cases. This is particularly true since so much of damages claimed are in
                            respect of prospective, and therefore necessarily contingent, loss.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    Accordingly, a court
                            has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to the proof of damage.
                            Different occasions may call for different evidence with regard to
                            certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the case and the
                            nature of the damages claimed. ... The correct approach that a court
                            should adopt is perhaps best summarised by Devlin J in the English High
                            Court decision of <em>Biggin &amp; Co Ld v Permanite,
                                Ld</em> [1951] 1 KB 422 (“<em>Biggin</em>”), where he held (at 438)
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to
                            have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    To summarise, a plaintiff cannot simply make a
                            claim for damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence
                            of the loss it has suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in
                            principle to recover damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has
                            attempted its level best to prove its loss <em>and</em> the evidence is cogent, the court should allow it to
                            recover the damages claimed.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff had in its Statement of Claim
                    claimed damages comprising of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cost of
                        repairs/replacement;</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Before the AR, the plaintiff’s former lawyers argued that the
                    defendant should pay US$500,000 as it was the cost of cure, <em>ie</em>, the cost of repairs or the replacement cost. Before me,
                    counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Susan Jacob (“Ms Jacob”),
                    who was assisted by Mr Glenn Knight, explained that the plaintiff accepted
                    the AR’s assessment of the value of the Crane at US$400,000, but she
                    argued that, in awarding damages to the plaintiff, the AR was wrong to have
                    deducted the scrap value of the Crane (<em>ie</em>,
                    US$100,000) from its pre-accident value of US$400,000. Put another way, the
                    plaintiff’s case at the appeal before me is that the defendant is liable
                    to pay for the full pre-accident value of the Crane, and it is for the defendant
                    to take over the Crane “as is, where is”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant’s arguments toggled
                    between two different positions. This was because the defendant did not take a
                    firm position as to whether its case was that the Crane was damaged or that it
                    was destroyed. The first contention was that the cost of repair should be
                    US$15,000, and in the alternative, the plaintiff was entitled to only the
                    replacement cost of a similar crane. The second contention was that if the Crane
                    was beyond repair, counsel for the defendant, Mr Walter Ferix
                    (“Mr Ferix”) accepted that the <em>prima
                        facie</em> measure of damages was the value of the chattel at the time
                    and place of destruction. However, he argued that as there was no available
                    market for the Crane, the plaintiff was only entitled to its current scrap value
                    and no more. Finally and in the alternative, the value of the Crane in 2007 was
                    S$150,000 based on the fair market value of comparable cranes with similar
                    characteristics as the Crane. Therefore, the AR was wrong to have assessed the
                    value of the Crane in 2007 at US$400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For expediency, I propose to discuss some of
                    the defendant’s arguments here since they are short points and hence
                    easily dealt with. First, the contention that there was no available market for
                    this Crane and, as such, the value of the Crane undamaged was the same as the
                    value of the Crane damaged, <em>ie</em>, its scrap value.
                    Mr Ferix argued that it would be impossible to find a 40-year old 150 ton
                    crawler crane in Singapore because the age of obsolescence of cranes in
                    Singapore was 30 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> By reason of that norm, the Crane was
                    obsolete and consequently, there would be no available market for such cranes in
                    Singapore. Therefore, the value of the Crane would be its scrap value. Not only
                    was the legal basis for his contention suspect (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>-<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> below),
                    Mr Ferix appeared to have disregarded the evidence of the defendant’s
                    own expert’s valuation of the Crane which was supposedly based on the
                    comparable values of cranes with similar characteristics as the Crane (see
                        <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>-<a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Second, Mr Ferix argued that the
                    plaintiff had neither used the Crane for many years nor attempted to sell or
                    rent the Crane. Developing his argument, Mr Ferix submitted that it would
                    be akin to the plaintiff receiving a windfall if the latter was awarded as
                    damages the value of the used Crane. Mr Ferix’s point was a
                    nonstarter. The law in this area is quite clear and it is set out succinctly in
                        “<em>Butterworth’s Law of
                    Damages</em>” at para 14.03:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Damages are awarded to a goods owner for loss or damage to the goods
                        themselves, rather than for pecuniary loss as such. Put another way, an
                        owner can generally be awarded the above measure of damages for destruction
                        or injury, whether or not he is actually impoverished as a result. For
                        example, if a car is destroyed, it is nothing to the point that the owner
                        did not in fact drive it, or that he might have given it away in the
                        future.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation of Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Earlier before the AR, the defendant argued
                    that no damages should be awarded for the damage to the Crane because the
                    plaintiff had failed to mitigate its losses. The AR summarised the
                    defendant’s arguments on mitigation and her decision was as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Damage to crane</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When he was represented by his previous solicitors, the Defendant’s
                        position was that the crane was already damaged prior to its being moved
                        from the Defendant’s yard to Haruki’s yard. His present counsel
                        now informs the court that having perused Lai J’s judgment, the
                        Defendant now accepts that a finding had been made that the crane was not
                        damaged prior to its removal. However, the Defendant now submits that the
                        damage occurred after it was moved to Haruki’s yard and hence, because
                        the Plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses thereafter, no damages
                        should be awarded on this head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PW2 [Yip] has testified that DW1 [Lim] and Haruki Lim had prevented him
                        from accessing the crane during the material time (<em>ie</em> around the time of breach, and after). As I prefer
                        PW2’s testimony over DW1’s, I accept PW2’s evidence on
                        this. Accordingly, D/C’s submission on this point is not sustained.
                        Even if the damage to the crane was not caused by the act of dismantling the
                        crane improperly, if DW1 prevented PW2 from accessing the crane, PW2
                        obviously will not be in any position to mitigate his losses. However, on
                        this point, I accept PW2’s evidence that the damage to the crane was
                        caused by the act of dismantling the crane improperly, and this was done by
                        Haruki on the Defendant’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before me, Mr Ferix repeated the same
                    arguments that were canvassed at the hearing of NA 18. I found difficulty with
                    Mr Ferix’s submissions that the plaintiff chose to “go after
                    the defendant for damages instead of reassembling the crane and selling/renting
                    out the Crane”. It was alleged that (a) the Crane and been removed to
                    Haruki’s yard on or about 18 April 2007, (b) the plaintiff was aware
                    of that fact on the same day or shortly thereafter, (c) the plaintiff,
                    initially, could have reassembled the Crane at a cost of US$15,000 but wilfully
                    chose not to do so, and (d) the plaintiff could have sold the Crane to Haruki
                    soon after 18 April 2007, but chose not to do so. In relation to the cost of
                    cure at US$15,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, the
                    submission was that Yip could have taken action soon after 18 April 2007, and
                    the subsequent deterioration in the condition of the Crane was not recoverable
                    from the defendant. I also found difficulty with Mr Ferix’s statement
                    that the “damage to the [Crane] was done only after it was allowed to
                    waste away at Haruki’s yard by the [plaintiff]”. It was alleged
                    that the plaintiff did not attempt to reassemble the Crane but chose to allow
                    the Crane’s component parts to lay exposed to the elements thereby causing
                    the Crane to waste away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Two points may be made. First, it seemed to me
                    that the defendant was re-arguing the liability issue when the trial judge had
                    expressly ruled against the defendant in <em>Yip Holdings v Asia
                        Link</em> at [111] (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Those findings should be read with [61],
                    [113] and especially Lai J’s further observations at [93]-[94] of
                        <em>Yip Holdings v Asia Link</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">93    Although he had initially prevaricated when first
                            questioned by counsel for the plaintiff, Lim eventually agreed when
                            pressed by the court (at N/E 172) that if the [Crane] was damaged while
                            it was being moved within the yard, he was liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94    In relation to moving the [Crane] to Haruki’s
                            yard without the plaintiff’s consent, Lim further admitted that as
                            a result of his instructions, Haruki practically took out all the parts
                            of the [Crane] which were then left in the open at Haruki’s yard.
                            He accepted that he was responsible for the present state of disrepair
                            of the crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Second and more importantly, mitigation of
                    damages as a defence must be properly pleaded and proved. Mr Ferix’s
                    contention that the plaintiff’s loss was due to its failure to mitigate
                    was raised at the hearing of NA 18. The AR should not have permitted and
                    entertained the arguments because there was no plea of mitigation of damages in
                    its Defence. The state of the defendant’s pleadings contravened the
                    established procedural rule that an assertion that the plaintiff had failed to
                    mitigate its loss must be pleaded and proved by the defendant relying on it (see
                        <em>Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 at [71] following <em>Geest plc v Lansiquot</em> [2002] 1 WLR 3111 at
                        [16]; and recently <em>The “Rainbow Star”</em> [2011]
                    3 SLR 1 at [56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There is no gainsaying the importance of a
                    specific plea of mitigation of damages as a defence following the restatement of
                    the principles of mitigation by the Court of Appeal in <em>The
                        Asia Star</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1154. For present purposes,
                    V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the court), <em>inter alia</em>, observed at [24]: (a) mitigation of damages involves an inquiry as to the
                    reasonableness of the innocent party’s action or inaction after the
                    breach, and (b) ordinarily it is the defendant’s burden of proving that
                    the innocent party had failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss, and
                    that the burden is not one that is easily discharged. In his overview of the law
                    relating to mitigation of damages, Rajah JA pointed out at [31] that whilst the standard of
                    reasonableness is said to be an objective one, it also takes into account
                    subjective circumstances such as the aggrieved party’s financial position.
                    Accordingly, the reasonableness inquiry falls short of being purely an objective
                    one. Furthermore, since the question of mitigation is a question of fact, and
                    the circumstances in which the plaintiff was placed by the breach dictated its
                    action or inaction, they would be matters of materiality that must be pleaded
                    with as much particularity as would be required in the
                circumstance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Significantly, two applications were taken out
                    by the defendant late, long after RA 389 and RA 399 were filed. The
                    defendant’s first application was related to mitigation of damages.
                    Summons No 86 of 2011 (“SUM 86”) filed on 10 January 2011 was
                    for leave to adduce further evidence by filing the Affidavits of
                    Evidence-in-Chief of two persons from Haruki, namely, Lim Choon Bock and Samy
                    Nathan, the defendant’s director and manager respectively. Interestingly,
                    the defendant wanted to show through the two witnesses from Haruki that once the
                    Crane was moved to Haruki’s yard, the defendant had nothing to do with the
                    Crane, that it was a matter between Haruki and the plaintiff, that Haruki did
                    not stop the plaintiff from accessing the Crane, and finally, that the condition
                    of the Crane was not as bad as it was made out to be by the plaintiff. The
                    application was dismissed by me on 31 January 2011. The defendant had not
                    appealed against the dismissal of SUM 86. I was of the view that SUM 86 was made
                    too late in the day, and above all, it was a veiled attempt to re-visit and
                    re-litigate the liability issue which it could no longer do so. Neither could
                    the defendant adduce evidence on failure to mitigate when mitigation was not
                    pleaded in its Defence. Previously, Lai J had (a) commented on the glaring
                    absence of Haruki’s representative as a witness in the liability trial
                    despite the pivotal role of Haruki’s director, Lim Choon Bock, who dealt
                    with the defendant’s Lim, and (b) recorded in the judgment the
                    defendant’s acknowledgement that it was responsible for the state of
                    disrepair of the Crane whilst it remained at Haruki’s yard (see <em>Yip Holdings v Asia Link</em> at [72] and
                [94]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant must have realised that its
                    pleadings were deficient for the latter on 28 January 2011 applied
                        <em>vide</em> Summons No 431 of 2011(“SUM
                    431”) for leave to amend the Defence to plead that the plaintiff had
                    failed to mitigate its loss. No particulars of the failure of the plaintiff to
                    mitigate were provided. It was telling that Mr Ferix withdrew SUM 431 on
                    14 February 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the premises, those parts of the
                    defendant’s submissions that traversed the issues of liability and
                    mitigation of damages were not considered by me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussions and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I now turn to the Assessment of Damages with
                    the relevant legal principles in mind (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>-<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                    above). In this particular case, the defendant refused to allow the plaintiff to
                    move the Crane in February and March 2007 and the Crane was later dismantled.
                    Due to the damage sustained by the Crane on 18 April 2007, the delay
                    associated with the non-repair of the Crane, the neglect and abuse of the Crane,
                    the plaintiff was permanently deprived of the Crane. Put another way, this
                    damage to property is analogous to the pecuniary loss consequent on a breach of
                    contract where the damaged property is said to correspond to a deprivation of
                    the contractual benefit which, in this case was to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, safeguard the Crane (see <em>Remedies for
                        Torts and Breach of Contract</em> at p 232).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     By way of background and clarification, the
                    defendant at the hearing of NA 18 had initially adopted the position that the
                    Crane was not in a working condition when it was kept at the defendant’s
                    premises. However, midway through the hearing, the defendant changed its
                    position, and Mr Ferix accepted that Lai J had made a finding of fact
                    that the Crane was in a working condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    Consequently, an application was made for leave to file an affidavit from an
                    expert witness, Mr Leng Kwang Chiang (“Mr Leng”) to
                    testify on the value of the Crane in 2007 based on the value of a working crane
                    of the type of crane in question.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Mr Leng filed his Affidavit
                    of Evidence-in-Chief on 16 June 2010. A supplementary affidavit was filed
                    on 21 July 2010 to correct typographical errors in Mr Leng’s
                    earlier affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The evidence adduced at the hearing of NA 18
                    pertained to the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     repair of the Crane would be
                        completely uneconomical as it would cost about US$500,000;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     the value of
                        the Crane as determined by the respective experts called by the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will consider the evidence in
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Crane was a constructive total loss</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Ms Jacob submitted that the cost of
                    repair would be US$500,000, and that what was left of the damaged Crane was its
                    scrap metal value of US$100,000. I was reminded that, at the trial on liability,
                    Lai J at [113] of Yip Holdings v Asia Link had found the Crane to be in a
                    deplorable condition and that it was near scrap value. The trial judge accepted
                    the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert witness, Mr Spencer Kenneth
                    Harold Spencer (“Mr Spencer”) that the Crane had been
                    neglected and abused. Lai J at [61]
                    noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Spencer opined that the [Crane] had been neglected and abused. He
                        surmised that the parts had been taken off by hacking and that they were not
                        professionally removed by experienced engineers. Many of the major parts had
                        been dismantled and dumped on the ground with some parts beyond repair while
                        others had rusted and would need to be replaced. There was little evidence
                        of maintenance work and the condition of the [Crane] was such that it was
                        near scrap value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The trial judge also noted the evidence of the
                    defendant’s own witness, Mr Abdul Razak, a marine engineer, who
                    agreed with Mr Spencer’s view on the state of deterioration of the
                    Crane and opined that it might be uneconomic to repair to reinstate it to
                    previous working condition (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Mr Spencer had estimated the total cost of repair to be about US$500,000
                    excluding the other costs of lifting equipment such as a forklift, a small crane
                    and an 85 ton crawler crane for the rebuilding and reassembly of the Crane (see
                        <em>Yip Holdings v Asia Link</em> at
                [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before me, Mr Ferix confirmed that the
                    condition of the Crane was not an issue at the hearing of NA 18 as it was
                    already decided by Lai J. Before the AR, the defendant did not adduce
                    evidence of the cost of repair of the Crane in its damaged state.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the other hand, the plaintiff called
                    Mr Ian Drysdale Banks (“Mr Banks”) as its expert
                    witness. Mr Banks testified on 9 April 2010. He had inspected the Crane
                    on-site and seen its condition before writing his report. Mr Banks opined
                    that it was commercially not viable to repair the Crane for it would cost the
                    sum of US$500,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The cost of repairs
                    in the sum of US$500,000 did not take into consideration the cost of replacing
                    the main boom which was found to be in an unusable condition. The condition of
                    the various component parts of the Crane was described in detail and the report
                    contained his recommendations on whether they were serviceable or had to be
                    replaced. Mr Banks assessed the Crane’s scrap value to be
                    US$100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The AR accepted that it was uneconomical to
                    repair the Crane. She proceeded to assess damages based on the value of the
                    Crane at the time and place of destruction. I agreed with the AR that the Crane
                    was a constructive total loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Value of the Crane: pre-breach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Crane was manufactured in 1967. It was an
                    old and second-hand crane that was no longer in production as its manufacturers
                    were no longer in business. The market was unable to supply any close replica or
                    suitable replacement of what had been lost. Damages were awarded for the loss of
                    the Crane. In other words, the loss was <em>prima
                        facie</em> the value of the Crane. A question for consideration is how
                    is the value of the Crane to be assessed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     One way of putting a monetary figure on the
                    value of the chattel is to use “market value”. Market value is
                    looked upon as the fairest way to objectively assess the value of a chattel
                    destroyed at the place and the time of the wrong. The function of an available
                    market as the basis upon which to determine compensation in damages in a case
                    involving negligent damage to goods was explained by Coleman J in <em>Derby Resources AG and another v Blue Corinth Marine Co
                        Ltd</em> [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 410 (“<em>Derby Resources</em>”). Colman J’s explanation
                    (which is of general application) states (at 416):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relevance of an available market in this exercise is thus simply to
                        provide evidence of the monetary value of the goods, both in their sound
                        condition and in their damaged condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in cases where the chattel can be replaced in the market,
                    evidence to assess compensation to the owner for the destroyed or lost chattel
                    is easily available. It is not disputed that expert evidence may be given of the
                    market value of the chattel as it was at the time and place of destruction (see
                        <em>The Harmonides</em> [1903] P 1 at p
                    5-6).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, if the market value cannot be
                    determined or will be inadequate because of the special or unique nature of the
                    chattel, the value of the chattel must still be ascertained, and the court has
                    to do the best it can on the available evidence. This is because the exercise
                    required to quantify the damages would involve the same objective and principle:
                    the value of the chattel at the time and place of destruction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I now come to what evidence the court can take
                    into consideration if there is no meaningful market value. The commentary in
                    para 14.11, <em>Butterworth’s Law of Damages</em> is
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [W]here there is otherwise no meaningful market value, the court must
                        attempt as best it can to value what was lost, or rather to determine what
                        it was worth to the claimant. For these purposes the admissible evidence
                        ranges widely. Courts have taken into account original cost less
                        depreciation, evidence of earnings (in the case of a chattel such as a
                        ship), insurance appraisals, bona fide offers, sales of similar chattels or
                        agreed resale prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Another suggestion that is instructive is
                    gathered from Coleman J’s observations in <em>Derby
                        Resources</em> (at 416 – 417):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There may be cases where the probative value of market prices at different
                        place or at different dates is weak but where the monetary value of the
                        goods indicated by that evidence can be corroborated by other evidence from
                        the place of delivery at the time of delivery with the result that on the
                        whole of the evidence the court can reach a conclusion. It is, however,
                        important to keep in mind that the purpose of the exercise is to ascertain
                        the objective monetary value of the goods, not their utility to the receiver
                        in the circumstances peculiar to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally as stated, the value of the Crane is
                    assessed at the place and time of the wrong. This is the general rule that
                    damages for tort or breach of contract are assessed as at the date of the
                    breach. It is recognised in the cases that such an inquiry may be factually
                    difficult, and should not be applied mechanistically in circumstances where
                    assessment at another date may more accurately reflect the compensatory
                    principle (see <em>Dodd Properties (Kent) Ltd v Canterbury City
                        Council</em> [1980] 1 WLR 433). Thus, events occurring
                    between the date of damage and the date of trial may fall to be taken into
                    account (see Scrutton LJ in <em>The Kingsway</em>
                    [1918] P 344 at 362).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, the AR held that it was
                    “fair to assess the value of damage to the crane by taking ... the value
                    of the crane as at the date of breach (February/March 2007)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In my view, what the AR meant to say was that she
                    would determine the Crane’s pre-breach or pre-accident value, and she
                    rightly identified the period to be in “February/March
                    2007”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I now come to the evidence of the expert
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff’s expert witness,
                    Mr Banks, was the Managing Director and co-owner of Mobile Crane Asia Pte
                    Ltd. The defendant’s expert witness, Mr Leng Kwang Chiang
                    (“Mr Leng”), was the Director of Valuations, Asia of
                    GoIndustry DoveBid Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Banks stated at paragraph 4 of his
                    Affidavit that he has had extensive experience working in the crane business
                    industry having worked over 30 years, holding various roles in engineering,
                    sales and senior management, in three of the largest companies in the industry,
                    namely Grove Crane, Krupp and Demag Cranes, which was acquired by Terex Cranes
                    in 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In preparing his report, Mr Banks read
                    and considered Mr Spencer’s affidavit evidence filed for the trial on
                    liability. He also gathered the condition of the Crane from the evidence given
                    by Yip and Mr Spencer at the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Mr Banks
                    also spoke to Yip. On 15 February 2007, Yip inspected the Crane with one
                    Chan Yeng Sum of Triple Gem with the view of estimating the labour and equipment
                    cost of moving the Crane out of the defendant’s premises. Photographs of
                    the Crane were taken at the time. Mr Banks also inspected the Crane on-site
                    before writing his report. He put forward a figure of US$400,000, in part based
                    on his understanding that the Crane was refurbished in 1997, and that its value
                    at that time was US$550,000 and it was financed to this amount. He had not seen
                    evidence to cast doubt in his mind that the Crane was not refurbished in 1997.
                    In re-examination, Mr Banks elaborated that these types of cranes were
                    built to last, and the older ones were built to enable refurbishing to be done,
                    unlike the modern ones. Maintenance, working conditions and climatic conditions
                    would play a part in the working life span of the cranes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Based on his knowledge of the market in 2007,
                    the figure of US$400,000 was what the Crane could be sold to his client in 2007,
                    and on the assumption that the Crane was in a working condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Mr Banks also explained that second-hand
                    cranes were in demand between 2007 and 2009 because of a world-wide
                    shortage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In cross-examination, Mr Banks was asked
                    a second time how he had arrived at the figure of US$400,000:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And your final sentence is that you estimate the
                            next value of the crane in February 2007 is in the region of US$400,000.
                            Can you explain how you arrived at this figure?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">From my knowledge of the market at the time. This
                            is how I make my living.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And this was based on the assumption that the crane
                            was in good working condition.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the other hand, Mr Leng was of the
                    view that the Fair Market Value of the Crane in 2007 would be
                        S$150,000.00.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Fair Market Value was defined in
                    Mr Leng’s appraisal report as:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A professional opinion of the estimated most probable price expressed in
                        terms of currency to be realised for property in an exchange between a
                        willing buyer and a willing seller, with equity to both, neither being under
                        compulsion to buy or sell, and both parties fully aware of all relevant
                        facts, as of the effective date of this appraisal report. Both the buyer and
                        the seller acknowledge that the assets must be dismantled and removed at the
                        buyer’s expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Leng’s valuation was on a
                    “Desktop” basis (meaning that a physical inspection of the crane
                    was not made). He considered that the closest guide to the Crane’s value
                    was to be found in certain comparables which he had put together in a table. The
                    table was annexed to his appraisal report. As stated earlier, the defendant was
                    no longer disputing Lai J’s finding that the Crane was in a working
                    condition when it was handed over to the defendant,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and as such, Mr Leng’s
                    evidence was based on comparable cranes in a working condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Yip had testified that the Crane was meant for
                    the offshore industry which was the plaintiff’s main business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He explained that the Crane was not
                    “a standard production”. It had to be specially ordered for the
                    offshore industry, and was thus unique. He said: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The special features are: the boom is ordered specially with a “92
                        inch”, high-lift boom. 92-inch refers to the diagonal measurement,
                        the length of the boom. Whereas a standard boom for a 150-ton crawler crane
                        is only 77 inches. The cords of the base unit has a 5 inch diameter, the
                        outer section is reduced to 3.5 inches. In comparison to the standard boom,
                        the outer cord is 3 and a-half inches, if I remember correctly. This 92-inch
                        boom actually was designed as part of one model higher of the American
                        hoist, the crane identified as 9310. This 9310 is rated at 225-tons, as
                        opposed to 150. The tracks of the standard-sized crawler crane is 44-inches,
                        whereas on my 9280, it is equipped with a 50-inch track. Again this track is
                        taken from 9310. The chassis of the 9280 also have an option available, to
                        extend the track by about 2 and a half feet wider. All these options are
                        needed for offshore operation because the crane will be mounted on a barge
                        in the open sea, where it is subjected to marine environment, waves action
                        etc. I have perused the Notes of Evidence of in respect of PW1’s
                        testimony for the AD given on 9 April 2010- he testified that under ISO
                        standards, the crane capacity is automatically reduced or downgraded by 40%,
                        in the marine environment. With these features identified, then the crane is
                        suitable for working in the environment. The wider track gives you
                        stability... .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Yip’s reference to Mr Banks’
                    evidence on the downgrading of the Crane for off-shore operations was further
                    explained in cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But for offshore operations, for a marine environment, we select features
                        to compensate the downgrading of the ISO features of the lifting capacity by
                        40%. To overcome that, we select components from a bigger crane to
                        compensate, and they came up with a new number only for this crane, 9280. So
                        it’s more like a special built model.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Yip also gave evidence before the AR that
                    there had been approaches to buy the Crane in 2007. I was mindful that the same
                    evidence was previously noted to be undisputed by Lai J in [38] of her decision (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). One interested party was Skyboom from
                    India, and the other was See Yong &amp; Sons from Malaysia. Yip referred to his
                    Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief filed for the liability trial where he had
                    recounted that between May and December 2007, one Ashni Suchdev of Skyboom was
                    prepared to buy the Crane at US$400,000 if it was in a fully operational
                        condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Yip’s offer to
                    Mr See Fann of See Yong &amp; Sons was to sell the Crane, rebuilt by
                    Haruki, at US$400,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> There was Haruki’s offer to buy
                    the Crane “as is, where is” for S$330,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In my view, the expert’s opinion of
                    value in the present case had to operate on the basis of experience and judgment
                    as opposed to having material on the basis of which to offer analytical
                    approaches. I accepted the AR’s reasons for preferring the opinion of
                    Mr Banks. Mr Banks had extensive knowledge, expertise and experience
                    in the heavy crane industry for over 30 years where he had held various roles in
                    engineering, sales and senior management in three of the largest companies in
                    the industry. The Crane in question was built by the American Hoist Company. The
                    American Hoist Company was acquired by Terex Cranes, of which Mobile Crane Asia
                    Pte Ltd was the official agent. In this sense, Mr Banks had particular
                    knowledge and experience of cranes manufactured by American Hoist
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In contrast, Mr Leng’s experience
                    as a licensed appraiser and valuer was more broad-based and general.
                    Mr Leng possesses a certificate in ship building and engineering from Ngee
                    Ann Polytechnic. During his career as an appraiser and valuer, he had valued
                    cranes of different makes. In his report under the heading “Use of the
                    Appraisal”, he wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The AR noted that Mr Leng had told the
                    court that he made his assessment based on internet information and general

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Actually, the boom was from 2005. It is the truth,

                            to me by people in the business.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     From the answers above, it is evident that
                    Mr Leng was lacking in terms of experience, expertise or knowledge of
                    American crawler cranes. Furthermore, I noted from the table and the printouts
                    attached to his report that the comparable cranes he had identified as having
                    similar characteristics as the Crane were located in various states in America.
                    Significantly, his valuation of S$150,000 was based on a sale “as is,
                    where is” to be removed at the expense of the buyer<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> and that valuation
                    would not assist the court as the appropriate measure of damages would have to
                    include the notional cost of transportation to Singapore. More importantly, the
                    cranes listed in the table prepared by Mr Leng were for use on land rather
                    than of the type used offshore in a marine environment with the special features
                    identified by Yip in his testimony (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>-<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Leng was informed by the defendant
                    that the length of the boom was 100 feet and based on that advice, Mr Leng
                    commented that this length was impractical in the sense of its proportion and
                        utility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> When told that the Crane’s shorter
                    boom was not for lifting but for offshore dredging purposes, he agreed with
                    counsel’s statement. However, he claimed without explanation that the
                    Crane could be used offshore as well as onshore and that it was not a dedicated
                    offshore crane.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In the end, he conceded that the Crane
                    would have to be converted to be used for onshore operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Later, when pressed by counsel for the
                    plaintiff, Mr Leng accepted that if the Crane had the special features Yip
                    talked about, the features would be considered as enhancements, and that his
                    valuation would be different in the sense that the value would be dependent on
                    the level of enhancement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     From the overall evidence,
                    Mr Leng’s evidence lacked probative value. In contrast, Mr Banks
                    provided more cogent and convincing evidence. Besides, the monetary value of the
                    Crane could be corroborated by the offer Yip received from Ashni Suchdev of
                    Skyboom who was prepared to buy the Crane at US$400,000 if it was in a fully
                    operational condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The figure of US$400,000 represented a
                    reasonably conservative figure for what its value would have been if the
                    defendant had not acted in breach of contract. It was accepted that in February
                    2007, an engine of the Crane had to be repaired<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and that it
                    would cost US$5,000 to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Against the figure of
                    US$400,000, a sum of US$5,000 had to be deducted. Notably, the next sum of
                    US$15,000 was the cost to reassemble the Crane. It was an expenditure that arose
                    because the defendant had wrongly caused the Crane to be dismantled. I agreed
                    with Ms Jacob that the AR was wrong to have deducted this sum from the
                    value of the Crane. Finally, I concluded that the defendant should take over the
                    Crane “as is, where is” since the award of US$395,000 was for
                    damages in full. Accordingly, there should be no deduction of the scrap value of
                    US$100,000 from the figure of US$400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Given that each side was partially successful
                    in respect of its own appeal, I ordered that each side is to bear its own
                    costs.</p>
