The underlying claim relates to various agreements under which Redeemable Convertible Preference Shares (“RCPS”) were issued by the plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was not entitled to exercise its rights under the said agreements to redeem the RCPS.  The central question in the appeal was whether it was plain and obvious that the plaintiff’s claim was unsustainable in law or fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the appeal and delivered some brief oral remarks in doing so.

In the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”), it was pleaded that there was no Default Event entitling the defendant to redeem the 93,320 RCPS.

The alleged efforts on the plaintiff’s part to redeem the defendant’s RCPS appeared to be directed toward a redemption of the RCPS, and not toward the achievement of an Exit Event which, as defined in the SSHAs, did not include redemption. The plaintiff’s claim is legally unsustainable as even if it succeeds in showing that the defendant failed to cooperate to achieve redemption, it would not succeed in showing that the defendant was in breach of an alleged duty to cooperate to achieve an Exit Event.

There was no mention of such an agreement in the pleadings. The correspondence between the parties showed that the discussion was centred on the possibility of redemption pursuant to Clause 2.4(f) (of the 2016 SSHA) rather than separately from it. There was also a distinct lack of clarity and certainty as to the nature and terms of this separate agreement, which the plaintiff claimed existed. Further, it was not clear why any alleged agreement had to be framed in terms of the amendment or expansion of an “Exit Event” as defined in the SSHAs, as opposed to a separate or collateral agreement between the parties.

The court could not imply such a term as the parties did contemplate the issue of which parties would have to work towards procuring an Exit Event, as seen at Clause 7.3(a) of the SSHAs.

In addition to the second issue, these arguments included whether the defendant had allegedly breached the implied duty to cooperate, whether the defendant was estopped from maintaining that the only means of exit from its investment in the plaintiff was through the five defined Exit Events, and whether amendment of the plaintiff’s pleadings could remedy any defects insofar as the pleadings did not contain any specific averment as to the existence of an agreement in or around June 2017 and any specific averment that the defendant was estopped by its conduct from denying that redemption of the RCPS would amount to an Exit Event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendant’s primary argument was that it was entitled to exercise its express right of redemption of its RCPS as no Exit Event had been completed by 31 December 2018. Separately, the defendant argued in the alternative that the plaintiff had breached material terms of the SSHAs and that it was therefore entitled to exercise its right of redemption. The AR had found that it was not plain and obvious that the plaintiff had breached material terms to trigger the defendant’s right of redemption given that the phrase “material term” was not defined in the SSHAs and its meaning was disputed between the parties (see [14(f)] above). Notwithstanding this, if the plaintiff were to fail on the first issue, it was immaterial whether the defendant could rely on the argument of breach of material terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The key question on appeal was whether the plaintiff’s claim was unsustainable in law or in fact such that it should be struck out. In this regard, I address in turn the following issues that arose on appeal:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there was an agreement reached in 2017 that redemption of the RCPS would be a sixth Exit Event;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the defendant was under an implied duty to cooperate with the plaintiff to achieve redemption of the RCPS by 31 December 2018;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if there were such an implied duty, whether the defendant had breached its duty; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the plaintiff had breached material terms of the SSHAs such that the defendant was entitled to exercise its right of redemption of its RCPS. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there was an agreement that redemption of the RCPS would be a sixth Exit Event</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff submitted that there was an oral agreement in or around June 2017 between the parties that the defendant’s RCPS would be redeemed by the plaintiff pursuant to a sixth Exit Event (“the June 2017 agreement”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Before the AR, the plaintiff took the position that the pleadings were clear and sufficient, notwithstanding that in the SOC, both the existence of the June 2017 agreement and estoppel by the defendant’s conduct were not expressly pleaded. On appeal, the plaintiff focused on the June 2017 agreement as a bulwark of its argument that the parties had in effect agreed to vary the SSHAs to allow for a sixth Exit Event. As such, the defendant was not entitled to invoke its right of redemption pursuant to Clause 2.4(f) of the 2016 SSHA and Clause 2.4(g) of the 2014 SSHA, both of which are contingent on the occurrence of a “Default Event” as defined in Clause 1.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The argument of a sixth Exit Event was canvassed before the AR in the plaintiff’s written submissions below. The plaintiff did not dispute that it was not pleaded but submitted that there was evidence in support of the argument that an agreement was reached in June 2017. The plaintiff continued to adopt this position on appeal given that the AR had found that the June 2017 agreement was a material fact which was not pleaded, and also that on the available evidence, the plaintiff’s efforts to redeem the RCPS had nothing to do with the procurement of an Exit Event as defined in paragraph 11(b) of the SOC and Clause 1.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s claim that the parties had reached an agreement that redemption of the defendant’s RCPS would constitute an Exit Event was unsustainable. There was no explicit agreement between the parties that redemption would be an Exit Event, and no resolution was passed to amend the definition of “Exit Event” in the SSHAs. Any such alleged agreement was also not pleaded. Further, there was no evidence that the parties had reached such an agreement based on the contemporaneous email correspondence. Even though the plaintiff claimed that a binding agreement had been reached, it was unable to articulate the terms of the agreement, or how the defendant would receive the proceeds of redemption. Finally, the parties had attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate a pre-redemption agreement. This reinforced the fact that no agreement had been concluded between them.  Since the plaintiff’s claim was factually unsustainable, amendments made to the pleadings would not change the outcome of the application.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Examining the parties’ conduct post-June 2017 as reflected in the documentary evidence before me, it is apparent that Mr Lee made a proposal for redemption of the RCPS which the defendant did not reject offhand but had attempted to explore with the plaintiff. As the AR had observed, however, there was nothing from the relevant correspondence between the parties to show that the defendant had <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to Mr Lee’s proposal for the defendant’s exit by way of redemption of the RCPS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my assessment, the best case that the plaintiff could put forth was that there was <span class="font-italic">some</span> in-principle understanding in or around mid-2017 that redemption <span class="font-italic">options</span> were to be explored. Parties thus entered into discussions on that basis. However, this fell short of an <span class="font-italic">agreement</span> to Mr Lee’s proposal, let alone any agreement that redemption of the RCPS would be a sixth Exit Event. In any case, there was no evidence that the redemption option(s) being explored would necessarily be tied to the 31 December 2018 deadline alongside the five expressly defined Exit Events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The plaintiff pointed to the EGM minutes (see [7] above), but this merely recorded that Mr Lee would table a <span class="font-italic">proposal</span> to enable the defendant to exit from its investment.

</div> This could not possibly establish that there was an agreement between the parties. The defendant also pointed out that subsequent to this EGM, email correspondence between the parties in August 2017 showed that till then, the plaintiff had not in fact tabled any such proposal to the defendant.

Such a position appears to differ from paragraph 20 of Mr Lee’s affidavit where he relied on the defendant’s lack of objection as the basis of the alleged agreement, stating that the defendant “did not object to [his] proposal and parties proceeded on the basis that the redemption of the [d]efendant’s RCPS would be a way for the [d]efendant to exit from its investment in the [p]laintiff”.

</div> On appeal, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendant’s lack of objection to continuing negotiations was further evidence in support of its position that a verbal agreement had been concluded between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In respect of the parties’ exchange of correspondence from which a verbal agreement could allegedly be inferred, the plaintiff pointed to emails sent from Mr Lee to Mr Lou and Mr Tan dated 14 June 2018 and 20 June 2018. In the email dated 14 June 2018, Mr Lee wrote that the defendant had been “verbally agreeing to redeem since last year”, and in the 20 June 2018 email, that the defendant was “willing to redeem with capital + interest”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, reading the emails in context, it was clear to me that no agreement had in fact been reached between the parties for redemption to take place. The 20 June 2018 email states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I had just finished a discussion with RCC about following back the last year method where we proceed to do all the fundraising activities first <span class="font-italic">before OWW commit to sign to redeem</span>. However RCC and me eventually disagreed this way and below are the reasons:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. <span class="font-italic">As per discussed over the phone,</span> <span class="font-italic">OWW is willing to redeem with capital + interest following the SHA</span>, hence by putting a commitment now is the same thing, and this will definitely ease our fund raising and then win-win for both parties.

But to us is a big difference, coz [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] with the confirm intention and amount, this will definitely ease and speed up the fundraising …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]The 20 June 2018 email makes it clear that the defendant had not in fact made any commitment yet to redemption of the RCPS. Correspondingly, the plaintiff was requesting the defendant to provide such a commitment so that it would be easier to raise funds. The suggestion that paragraph 2 of the email was evidence of an agreement was misplaced. At best, on Mr Lee’s own terms as contained in paragraph 2 of his email, this was merely an indication of the defendant’s possible willingness for its RCPS to be redeemed “following the SHA”. Otherwise, there would have been no need for Mr Lee to “hope” that the defendant would “help by giving [the plaintiff] a commitment to confirm to redeem before [the plaintiff] start[s] fund raising”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Assuming that the defendant’s alleged verbal agreement was purportedly communicated through Mr Lou by his emails with the plaintiff, the more critical issue was that none of Mr Lou’s emails contained any suggestion that such an agreement existed to the effect that redemption constituted a sixth Exit Event. Instead, the language in all of Mr Lou’s emails was unambiguous. Mr Lou consistently reiterated the need for the plaintiff to have sufficient redemption funds. He spoke of redemption, issuance of redemption notices and avoidance of redemption shortfalls. None of these references was relevant to Exit Events, and more importantly, Mr Lou expressly linked them to Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the 2016 and 2014 SSHAs respectively, which deal with the defendant’s right of redemption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff pointed to further email correspondence which allegedly showed that the defendant did not object to redemption as a sixth Exit Event. The plaintiff referred to an email sent from Mr Lee to Mr Lou and Mr Tan, updating them about the fundraising process and negotiating the price to be paid for redeeming the RCPS. It was argued that in Mr Lou’s reply dated 5 September 2017, he did not object to the RCPS being redeemed on the basis of redemption as an Exit Event.

</div> However, this email itself unequivocally showed that Mr Lou had contemplated any redemption of the defendant’s RCPS to be governed by the conditions set out in Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the respective SSHAs pertaining to redemption, in particular the redemption price. The email states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Pursuant to Clause 2.4(g)(ii) of the [2014 SSHA] and Clause 2.4(f)(ii) of the [2016 SSHA]</span>, the Redemption Amount has to be the aggregate subscription price plus interest of 10.0% per annum compounded annually…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pls also note that, pursuant to Clause 7.1(c) of [the 2016 SSHA], the Founder (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Mr Lee) unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to pay any <span class="font-italic">outstanding Redemption Shortfall</span> not paid by the Company within ten (10) days of the Investor’s written demand. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In their email exchanges, Ms Yang and Mr Lee both mentioned the topic of redemption and issuance of a redemption notice.

</div> I was not persuaded by Mr Lee’s attempt to explain away the mention of a redemption notice in Ms Yang’s email dated 5 October 2017. The words are plain and obvious, and it was disingenuous to suggest that they were intended to mean something else. Further, in Mr Lee’s reply to Mr Lou, he proposed negotiating the timeline set out in Clause 2.4(f)(iii). Mr Lee himself had asked the defendant to “go ahead and send the redemption notice”. It is clear that parties were consistently on the same page in relation to referring to a redemption notice <span class="font-italic">under the SSHAs</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I note that the plaintiff on appeal had proposed amendments to the SOC, and that in these amendments, it had pleaded that the “parties agreed that the ‘Exit Event’ would include a redemption of the [d]efendant’s RCPS and this redemption would be in accordance with Clause 2.4(g) of the [2014 SSHA] (save for Clause 2.4(g)(i)) and Clause 2.4(f) of the [2016 SSHA] (save for Clause 2.4(f)(i))”.

</div> In my view, this was an afterthought to account for the parties’ references to Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) in their contemporaneous correspondence and to link them to a sixth Exit Event that had been allegedly agreed upon. On the plaintiff’s own case, the parties had agreed to redemption in accordance with Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the respective SSHAs, but Mr Lee was attempting to negotiate to reduce the redemption price.

Both parties had referenced Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) and had negotiated for early redemption on terms separate from any Exit Event. Even if the plaintiff and/or Mr Lee had understood early redemption to be an Exit Event in accordance with Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the respective SSHAs, there was certainly no agreement from Mr Lou and/or the defendant that redemption would constitute an Exit Event. Mr Lou had repeatedly insisted on following the pricing terms as provided for in Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the respective SSHAs and made no mention of any Exit Event in his emails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The plaintiff further argued that Mr Lee explicitly referred to the December deadline in an email to Mr Lou and Mr Tan on 6 June 2018.

The parties may have been negotiating for the defendant’s early exit from its investment, and Mr Lee appears to have sought to strike a bargain on terms more favourable to the plaintiff than Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) would allow, and for the SSHAs to thereafter be dissolved. It would therefore be logical for the parties to have considered any early redemption to take place before 31 December 2018. As stated above at [38], even if Mr Lee viewed redemption as an Exit Event, it would merely have been his unilateral view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiff also referred to an unsigned shareholders’ resolution where there was a reference to redemption of the defendant’s RCPS pursuant to Clause 7.3(a) of the SSHAs. However, this document again had to be viewed in context. Mr Lee stated in his affidavit that this draft shareholders’ resolution along with other documents were prepared in the process of negotiating a pre-redemption agreement with the defendant between July to August 2018. The pre-redemption agreement “[set] out the [p]laintiff’s proposal to pay the sum of S$300,000 in exchange for the [d]efendant’s cooperation with the fundraising process”.

</div>
</div> As further explained at [43] below, the fact that a pre-redemption agreement was drafted and eventually aborted showed that the parties did not have an agreement at that point in relation to how the defendant’s RCPS were to be redeemed by the plaintiff, much less that redemption would constitute a sixth Exit Event. Since negotiations in relation to the pre-redemption agreement fell through, the shareholders’ resolution was never signed by the parties. In any event, this resolution was only drafted pursuant to discussions in July to August 2018, which would not support the plaintiff’s case that an oral agreement was reached in June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The plaintiff’s position was that the documents and email correspondence between the parties had made it “very clear” that there was an agreement between the parties that the defendant’s RCPS would be redeemed pursuant to a sixth Exit Event.

</div> However, for the reasons I have given, these documents and emails did not assist the plaintiff in proving the existence of a verbal agreement in or around June 2017 whereby the defendant had agreed to redemption of the RCPS as a sixth Exit Event, or that any agreement was reached for redemption to take place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As the AR opined, the lack of clarity and certainty in terms was also relevant in determining that no agreement was reached between the parties. I concurred. A crucial agreed term would be the redemption price, given that the plaintiff disputed the defendant’s position that it should be pegged to what was set out in Clause 2.4(g)(ii) of the 2014 SSHA and Clause 2.4(f)(ii) of the 2016 SSHA.

</div> There was also no cogent reason why negotiations towards possible redemption options could not have been the subject of a separate or collateral agreement, but must have been encompassed under an additional Exit Event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The fact that a pre-redemption agreement was negotiated in 2018 but ultimately not concluded was also a relevant consideration. This fortified my view that the defendant was attempting to explore with the plaintiff possible redemption options but there had been no agreement on the basic modalities. Meanwhile, the 31 December 2018 deadline for an Exit Event drew near. The plaintiff sought to argue that the “aim of the pre-redemption agreement” was to secure the defendant’s compliance with its implied duty to cooperate, and that redemption itself had already been agreed upon.

</div> However, this position was untenable. In the pre-redemption agreement, the plaintiff offered the defendant a $300,000 non-refundable deposit in exchange for the defendant’s cooperation with the plaintiff for any matter relating to fundraising arrangements, including the signing and execution of relevant documents such as the relevant shareholders’ and directors’ resolutions.

</div> That the pre-redemption agreement eventually was not signed further suggested that there was no agreement between the parties as to how the defendant’s RCPS were to be redeemed. In any event, the draft of the pre-redemption agreement did not state that redemption would constitute an Exit Event.

</div> Here, the defendant’s cooperation was necessary for an Exit Event to be procured, as it deals with the defendant’s property rights as the holder of the RCPS, and its written approval would be expressly required for the completion of an Exit Event.

</div> According to the plaintiff’s interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>, <span class="font-italic">McCarrick v Liverpool Corporation </span>[1947] AC 219 and academic texts, the duty to cooperate is a term to be implied in law.

</div> Finally, the plaintiff argued that Clause 7.3 of the SSHAs, which states that the plaintiff and Mr Lee shall use their best endeavours to procure an Exit Event, did not preclude an implied duty on the part of the defendant to cooperate to achieve an Exit Event. As such, there was no inconsistency between its proposed implied term and the SSHAs.

</div> In relation to the plaintiff’s defined category of contracts in which such a term should be implied, the defendant submitted that since the court would need to make a factual finding as to whether there was an obligation that could not be effectually done unless both parties cooperated, such a duty should be a term implied in fact.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As I had ruled in favour of the defendant on the first issue, it was not strictly necessary to deal with the second issue and the remaining arguments canvassed by the plaintiff. Nevertheless, for completeness, I set out my reasons for agreeing with the AR that there was no implied duty to cooperate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Clause 7.3(a) contains a “best endeavours” provision which places the burden on the plaintiff and the Founder (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Lee) to exercise best endeavours to procure or achieve the completion of an Exit Event. There is no provision imposing any similar burden on the defendant. As held in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>at [94]–[95], the court would only consider implying a term into a contract where the parties did not contemplate an issue and had failed to make provision for it, thus leaving a gap. It was clear on the face of the SSHAs that parties had contemplated the issue of who had the duty to procure the Exit Event. There was therefore no gap left by the parties and the AR justifiably found no basis on which the courts would imply a term in fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I agreed with the defendant that <span class="font-italic">Mackay</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon </span>and <span class="font-italic">Evergreat </span>could be distinguished. In <span class="font-italic">Mackay</span>, Lord Blackburn stated at 263 that where “it appears that both parties have agreed that something shall be done, which cannot effectually be done unless both concur in doing it”, there was an implied duty that parties would do all that is necessary for the doing of that thing. The facts of <span class="font-italic">Mackay </span>are such that parties had entered into a sale and purchase contract for a digging machine, subject to a condition precedent that the seller demonstrate to the buyer via a test that the machine was functioning adequately. The court held that there was an implied duty that the buyer was to cooperate in enabling a fair test to be done (at 264). In <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>, the court similarly held at [143] that “[i]f two parties enter into a contract subject to a condition precedent which can be satisfied only if both parties cooperate, a term may readily be implied that both parties are under an obligation to cooperate in order to facilitate the fulfillment of that condition”. On the facts, parties had reached an oral agreement to compromise their disputes, with the approval of the Attorney-General as a condition precedent (at [9]). The court implied into the agreement a duty to cooperate to procure the approval of the Attorney-General (at [145]). In <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>, parties jointly submitted a Consent Order which stated that its dispute would be submitted to an independent assessor for assessment. The court held that the plaintiff had an obligation to cooperate with the defendant to facilitate the assessment process (at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In these three cases, the parties had entered into agreements which either contained a condition precedent, or a term that the parties would presumptively agree to cooperate on for the contract to be effectual. However, that was patently not how the SSHAs were structured. On the face of the SSHAs, the parties did not even agree that an Exit Event or redemption of the defendant’s RCPS had to take place. If an Exit Event did not take place, Clauses 2.4(f) and 2.4(g) of the respective SSHAs would then apply such that the RCPS could be redeemed. In that scenario, the clear terms of the SSHAs are that the defendant has the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> right and entitlement to unilaterally require the redemption of the RCPS and the plaintiff could not demand that the defendant seek redemption. Clause 2.4(f) provides that the defendant “may, but is not obliged” to issue a redemption notice. There is therefore no basis on which to imply a duty on the defendant to cooperate to facilitate the redemption of its RCPS to achieve a sixth Exit Event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The context of the SSHAs as well as the conduct of the parties also made it amply clear that there was no implied duty to cooperate. As mentioned above at [43], the parties were in negotiations for a pre-redemption agreement in or around July 2018, which the plaintiff claimed was to obtain the cooperation of the defendant for redemption to proceed. The plaintiff’s offer of an advance payment of $300,000 “in exchange” for the defendant’s full cooperation in the plaintiff’s fundraising efforts

If a duty to cooperate did exist in law, such an offer to “incentivise” the defendant towards cooperation, which was allegedly made pursuant to Mr Lee having obtained legal advice, would have been completely unnecessary. In any event, it cannot be that the defendant was under any legal duty to help the plaintiff raise funds to redeem its own shares, much less that the defendant should be bound to cooperate by acceding to Mr Lee’s attempts to negotiate for a lower redemption amount. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Moreover, it was untenable for the plaintiff to suggest that the defendant should be compelled by law to cooperate when the plaintiff was the party initiating a possible early redemption of the RCPS. As Clause 1.1 of the SSHAs makes clear, the defendant must be prepared to give its <span class="font-italic">written approval</span> to any of the five defined Exit Events. One of the five events included a sale of the defendant’s entire shareholding to a third party <span class="font-italic">at a price acceptable to </span><span class="font-italic">the defendant</span>. It was not entirely clear to me why the plaintiff had highlighted the “sale by the [defendant]” option under Clause 1.1 in his affidavit,

</div> and then sought to characterise redemption of the RCPS as a sixth Exit Event, but it is beyond dispute that there was no written approval from the defendant or any agreed price which was acceptable to the defendant.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The issue of whether a duty to cooperate is a term to be implied in fact or in law was not directly engaged in the present case. The distinction between terms implied in fact and in law has been elucidated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518. Implying a term in law involved broader policy considerations and once implied, such a term would also be implied in all future contracts of that particular type (at [38] and [46]). I did not think it was entirely accurate for the defendant to advance the proposition that a term would be one implied in fact if the court had to undertake a factual assessment to determine whether the contract was of a particular type. However, I did not find it necessary to examine this issue further as there was no scope for the implication of such a duty here. Implying a duty to cooperate on the defendant to procure an Exit Event would be inconsistent with the structure of the SSHAs. As explained at [52]–[54] above, the SSHAs would not have fallen into the category of contracts proposed by the plaintiff for which a duty to cooperate should be implied in law, since there had been no agreement between the parties to either procure an Exit Event or achieve redemption.  Further, insofar as this purported “Exit Event” envisioned by the plaintiff was redemption, it would be inconsistent with the express terms of the SSHAs to imply a duty to cooperate on the defendant to facilitate redemption of its RCPS.  The SSHAs expressly gave the defendant discretion to decide whether and when its RCPS would be redeemed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendant had breached an implied duty to cooperate </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiff argued that the defendant had breached the implied duty to cooperate with the plaintiff to procure an Exit Event. As a result of this breach, an Exit Event could not be completed by 31 December 2018. Despite numerous emails sent to the defendant from 2017 to 2018, it had refused to provide the plaintiff with a written confirmation of its intention to exit from its investment, and the price it would be willing to accept for the redemption of its RCPS.

</div> Referencing Mr Lee’s email dated 30 December 2018 (see [9] above), the plaintiff submitted that the email showed that the defendant’s non-cooperation led to difficulties in securing a deal with potential investors. Despite the defendant’s refusal to cooperate for over a year, the plaintiff had finally managed to locate an investor, as communicated in the email of 30 December 2018. It was therefore “desperate to get a written commitment so that [it could] conclude this deal with this potential investor”. The plaintiff asserted that even though it had told the defendant that it could “go ahead to issue a redemption notice”, it had merely been “compelled” to do so, in order to “at the very least get some kind of written confirmation to facilitate the fundraising”, as the defendant was not cooperating in the redemption process.

First, the cooperation sought by the plaintiff did not fall within the scope of any implied duty to cooperate. Whilst the plaintiff claimed that the defendant refused to provide a written confirmation, under the SSHAs, the plaintiff and Mr Lee could not demand that the defendant accept an Exit Event or dictate the terms of the redemption of the defendant’s RCPS. They also could not demand that the defendant prejudice its own interests by giving a confirmation that the RCPS would be redeemed before the plaintiff had secured an investor or confirmed the redemption price. The SSHAs provided that it was within the defendant’s discretion to decide whether to approve an Exit Event or to require the plaintiff to redeem its RCPS after the relevant cut-off dates.

The defendant argued that it could only be disentitled from asserting a contractual right or claiming a contractual benefit if this right or benefit was accrued as a direct result of its prior breach of contract. However, its right under Clause 2.4 was not a “direct result” of any such alleged breach. It retained the discretion under the SSHAs to approve or reject an Exit Event whether or not it had cooperated with the plaintiff, and its right to demand that the plaintiff redeem its RCPS under Clause 2.4 would arise as long as an Exit Event was not achieved by the cut-off date.

There were no grounds to suggest that the defendant had sought to obstruct or impede the plaintiff’s efforts to secure potential investors. A duty to cooperate extended only to doing what was reasonable in the circumstances (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Hoon </span>at [149]). It was not unreasonable for the defendant to withhold providing written confirmation of intended redemption since there was no agreed redemption sum or evidence of adequate redemption funds forthcoming from the plaintiff. By the plaintiff’s own account, the plaintiff had one and a half years from June 2017 to see to the necessary funding arrangements which would be prerequisites to a firm agreement being reached with the defendant. It was only on 30 December 2018 that the plaintiff informed the defendant that it had “finally” managed to secure an indication of interest from an investor and purported to offer the defendant a “smooth exit”.

</div> As a shareholder’s voting right was fundamental, these clauses had to be material terms. Clause 10.1(dd) had been breached as Mr Lou had been removed as an authorised bank signatory without the defendant’s approval, and Clause 10.1(e) had been breached as the plaintiff and Mr Lee had increased the directors’ salaries and allowances paid to Mr Lee and his wife Ms Loi (who was also a director of the plaintiff) without prior shareholder approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Clause 7.4 provided that the plaintiff and Mr Lee had an obligation to procure and supply to the defendant financial documents within stipulated time periods. The defendant submitted that this clause was a material term as Clause 19.1 provided that “time shall be of the essence … as regards any dates and periods mentioned”. This clause had been breached as the plaintiff frequently failed to meet the deadlines for information submission stipulated under Clause 7.4. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The plaintiff took the position that these clauses were not material terms. According to the plaintiff, a “material term” is to be interpreted as a “condition” within the meaning of the condition/warranty approach set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 413. According to the plaintiff, Clauses 10.1(e), 10.1(dd) and 7.4(a) to (d) were not intended to be material terms. It argued that the defendant, a venture capital fund, would not have intended to participate in the day-to-day management of the plaintiff and its sole interest was to earn returns on its investments. Accordingly, “material” terms would be those that would undermine the value of the defendant’s shareholding if breached.

</div> It also offered various defences to the defendant’s claim, including waiver or estoppel, and that the defendant had failed to issue a notice of breach in respect of certain alleged breaches.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The phrase “material term” in Clause 1.1 of the SSHAs was not defined in the SSHAs. I agreed with the AR that additional evidence would need to be adduced as to what the parties had intended to be construed as material terms. In interpreting a contract, the court is to “determine and give effect to the intention of the parties, objectively ascertained” (<span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 885 at [30], referencing <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029). While the defendant had made various assertions as to whether the relevant clauses were fundamental or important terms in the SSHAs, the court would have to ascertain which terms should be deemed “material” such that a breach would amount to a Default Event, entitling the defendant to exit from its investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I did not think that the defendant’s position was so incontrovertibly made out that it would be dispositive of the main issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it had a right to demand that the plaintiff redeem its RCPS. As such, the plaintiff’s claim would not have been struck out on this basis without more. However, as noted at [17] above, whether the defendant could rely on the plaintiff’s alleged breaches of material terms is immaterial since I had found that the plaintiff failed on the first issue, which formed the core of its arguments on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For the reasons I have set out above, the appeal was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for costs of the appeal, the defendant submitted that a sum of $10,000 would be appropriate, with an additional $1,090 for disbursements. The plaintiff submitted that a sum of $5,000 inclusive of disbursements would be appropriate, on the basis that there were no additional affidavits filed and the submissions and authorities were substantially similar to those canvassed at the hearing below.

Considering the submissions on costs by both parties as well as the costs guidelines set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, I ordered costs of the appeal to the defendant, to be fixed at $9,000 inclusive of disbursements.
