The court would “readily grant anti-suit injunctions to restrain such proceedings” commenced in breach of exclusive jurisdiction clauses: <span class="font-italic">Vinmar Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1271 (“<span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>”) at [115]. If there is no exclusive jurisdiction clause, however, then the other four factors must be considered carefully – apart from showing that Singapore is the natural forum, “it must be only in the clearest of circumstances that the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive before an injunction can be granted and justified”: <span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew v Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 148 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Yew</span>”) at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 This distinction was summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd</span> [2019] 1 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>”). Although this case was not cited by the parties, the principles within were not in dispute. After citing the factors listed at [19] above, the Court of Appeal stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> 67     <span class="font-weight-bold">Although the factors are to be considered in the round, a breach of an agreement has been regarded as a separate basis on which an anti-suit injunction may be granted; one that is distinct from vexatious or oppressive conduct</span>: <span class="font-italic">UBS AG v Telesto Investments Ltd</span> [2011] 4 SLR 503 (“<span class="font-italic">Telesto Investments</span>”) at [111]; <span class="font-italic">BC Andaman Co Ltd v Xie Ning Yun</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1232 (“<span class="font-italic">BC Andaman</span>”) at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</span> [2018] SGHC 90 at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Fentiman</span> at para 16.39.

There will be no need to adduce additional evidence of unconscionable conduct in such cases. Crucially, however, this approach is subject to an important caveat: there is no requirement for the court to feel any diffidence in granting an anti-suit injunction, “<span class="font-italic">provided that it is sought promptly and before the foreign proceedings are too far advanced</span>” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA (The “Angelic Grace”)</span> [1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87 (“<span class="font-italic">The Angelic Grace</span>”) at 96. In the same vein, Lord Bingham in <span class="font-italic">Donohue</span> at [24] had also held that “a party may lose his claim to equitable relief by dilatoriness or other unconscionable conduct”. The issue of delay and how it relates to comity are key to the determination of this appeal and we turn now to it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 VKC highlighted that this is not a case where there are parallel proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction and in Singapore. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew</span> distinguished such a situation from a situation where there are concurrent proceedings in two jurisdictions, and held that in the former scenario: “as long as the party who commenced the foreign proceedings was entitled to do so, whether or not the foreign courts recognise this, then our courts should be extremely cautious in granting an injunction” (at [23]). However, this must be read in line with the authorities relating to exclusive jurisdiction clauses, such that a party who commences the foreign proceedings in breach of such an agreement cannot be considered as “entitled to do so” in the words of the Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the present case, VKC did not dispute that the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over her.

</div> While she has not raised any alleged injustice as a separate argument, I note that she has addressed it together with the question of vexation and oppression, and, in any case, all the factors could not be separated but had to be considered in the round: <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>at [67]. Taking the parties’ positions and arguments, these were the issues for my determination:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Indonesian Proceedings were brought in breach of the Settlement Agreement: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether the Administrators could rely on cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether the Indonesian Proceedings fell within the scope of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Singapore was the natural forum;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the Indonesian Proceedings were vexatious or oppressive to the Administrators; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the grant of the anti-suit injunction would cause any injustice to VKC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I held that the Administrators could rely on cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement and the Indonesian Proceedings fell within the terms of that exclusive jurisdiction clause. I further held that Singapore was the natural forum and that the Indonesian Proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive if allowed to continue. I therefore exercised my discretion to grant the anti-suit injunction in terms of prayer 2 of SUM 96. I turn now to explain these conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The primary contention made by the Administrators was that the Indonesian Proceedings had been brought in breach of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement, which read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore. The Parties agree that in respect of all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its existence, validity, breach and enforcement, shall be first submitted to mediation at the Singapore International Mediation Centre and the mediator shall be Mr [xxx] <span class="font-italic">S.C.</span> The Parties further agree that only if the Parties have in good faith carried out the mediation and they have not been able to resolve their dispute, controversy, claim and/or disagreement, then, and in that event only, the Parties shall commence legal proceedings in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The “Parties” as defined by the Settlement Agreement refers to the 15 respondents, and does not include the Administrators. It was not disputed that the Administrators were not, as such, parties to the Settlement Agreement. There were therefore two issues to be resolved. First, whether the Administrators could rely on cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement? Second, if they could, did the Indonesian Proceedings fall within the scope of cl 19? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Can the Administrators rely on cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Administrators relied on the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed) (“CRTA”) to argue that they were entitled to enforce cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. The material portions of s 2 of the CRTA read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (referred to in this Act as a third party) may, in his own right, enforce a term of the contract if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the contract expressly provides that he may; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) <span class="font-italic">subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-italic">Subsection (1)(b) shall not apply if, on a proper </span><span class="font-italic">construction of the contract, it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) <span class="font-italic">The third party shall be expressly identified in the contract by name</span>, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) This section shall not confer a right on a third party to enforce a term of the contract otherwise than subject to and in accordance with any other relevant terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) <span class="font-italic">For the purpose of exercising his right to enforce a term of the contract, there shall be available to the third party any remedy that would have been available to him in an action for breach of contract if he had been party to the contract (and the rules relating to damages, injunctions, specific performance and other remedy shall apply accordingly) and such remedy shall not be refused on the ground that, as against the promisor, the third party is a volunteer</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is clear that the Settlement Agreement did not expressly provide that the Administrators may enforce cl 19. The Administrators, therefore, had to rely on s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CRTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29  The approach to be taken in applying s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CRTA can be derived from the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">CLAAS Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng Boon Ching</span> [2010] 2 SLR 386:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The court first considers whether s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is satisfied. While “[t]here is no requirement that benefiting the third party must be the predominant purpose or intent behind the term”, “it must be <span class="font-italic">a</span> purpose of the parties” [emphasis in original]: at [28].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must be read with s 2(2). The burden of proof lies on the party invoking s 2(2) to show “on a proper construction of the contract, that the parties did not intend the term concerned to be enforceable by the third party”: at [29]. In that regard, “[t]he mere absence in the contract of an express statement that the third party is to have the right to enforce the term is not a bar to his entitlement under s 2(1) to do so. Neither is such absence an indication of a contrary intention”: at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Before turning to the facts of this case, I pause here to note that the present case does not involve some of the more thorny issues relating to third-party enforcement of exclusive jurisdiction clauses. The High Court has previously noted that “the boundaries of the effect of exclusive forum clauses (whether exclusive jurisdiction or arbitration clauses) on third parties are being tested” in many cases and constitutes a complex area of law: <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang 1401 Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd</span> [2020] SGHC 20 (“<span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang</span>”) at [82]. However, in many of the cases discussed in <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang</span>, and which constitute or are related to what has been called the <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span> line of cases (after the decision in <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium Shipping Ltd v Sea Consortium Pte Ltd</span> [2001] EWHC 540 (Admlty) (“<span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span>”)), the statutory provisions relating to the enforcement of contractual terms by third parties were not referred to. This is likely because the commercial contracts in question expressly excluded the application of statutes similar to the CRTA (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Dell Emerging Markets (EMEA) Limited and another v IB Maroc.</span><span class="font-italic">Com SA</span> [2017] EWHC 2397 (Comm) at [13]), or because the contracts in question fell within the provisions which exclude the application of such statutes from certain classes of contracts (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, contracts for the carriage of goods by sea, which <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was concerned with), or perhaps because they were governed by laws that did not include such statutory provisions. Put another way, these cases involved attempts by third parties to rely on exclusive jurisdiction or arbitration clauses in the absence of a statute that provided for such enforcement. It also follows that whatever reservations expressed by the High Court about the applicability of <span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang</span> and the <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span> principle to actions in tort brought in foreign proceedings did not apply in the present case (except to the extent of the question of whether such tort claims would fall within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction clause), since those concerns arose specifically in relation to the <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span> line of cases. The only questions here were whether s 2 of the CRTA applied to cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement, and whether the Indonesian Proceedings fell within cl 19. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In order to answer whether cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement purported to confer a benefit on the Administrators, it is important to consider the Settlement Agreement as a whole. I turn to set out some of the key terms in the Settlement Agreement that deal with or concern the Administrators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Clause 1 of the Settlement Agreement expressly mentioned the Administrators by name and provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Parties agree that [VJZ] and [VKA] … (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">New Administrators</span>”) shall be the administrators/executors of the Estate in all jurisdictions, including but not limited to Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong SAR, and the People’s Republic of China. To this end, Parties shall do all things necessary, including the lodgement of the necessary applications, the withdrawal and/or discontinuance of proceedings in Indonesia and/or the drawing up of the relevant public declarations before the Notary, to appoint and recognise the New Administrators as the administrators and/or executors of the Estate. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Notably, the agreement between the respondents that the Administrators were to be administrators in all of those jurisdictions came with the attendant obligation to “do all things necessary … to appoint or recognise” them in their roles in each of these jurisdictions. For completeness, I note that by way of cl 1, s 2(3) of the CRTA was satisfied since the Administrators were expressly identified in the Settlement Agreement by name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Clause 2 then provided a number of steps that “shall be taken” for the administration of the Estate, including the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Administrators “shall take all necessary steps” to pay to Family [A] a sum agreed within a reasonable period of time from the date of the appointment as administrators of the Estate (subject to a maximum period of four years). Family [A] would accept that the sum paid “constitutes and/or is a complete and exhaustive quantification and representation of their full entitlement to the Estate”. The other beneficiaries may contribute to the sum to be paid to Family [A], and they agreed not to receive any sums from the Estate until Family [A] had received payment in full. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the interim, the Administrators were to make distributions to Family [A] every six months, and were to provide their reasons to them if they are unable to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Clause 3 dealt with the steps to be taken after the payment to Family [A] was made under cl 2. In particular, it dealt with the situation where the Administrators contemplated sale of any assets in the Estate, requiring them to give a right of first refusal over any asset to the respondents. Under cl 3.a., the respondents were granted ten days once the Administrators presented the offer to decide whether to negotiate an agreement to purchase the asset. Clause 3.b. then provided that the respondent who wished to do so would send a written notice within the ten-day period, following which that party and the Administrators would commence good faith negotiations for up to 30 days after the notice is given. Under cl 3.c., if no notice was given, or no legally binding contract was entered into, then the Administrators would be free to enter into an agreement with a third party for the sale of the assets on terms that should be more favourable than the terms offered by that respondent to the Administrators. Clauses 3.d. to 3.f. went on to make provision for the situation where one of the respondents wished to purchase a certain asset from the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Clause 4 provided that the costs of the First Trustee (see [3] above) and the Administrators would be borne by the Estate, except that Family [A] shall not be responsible for any of the costs, and these costs should not be deducted from the sum owed to Family [A] under cl 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Clause 5 then went on to describe a number of acts as “material breach[es]” which would entitle the respondents to treat the Settlement Agreement as null and void (subject to any rectification of the default within 30 days of receiving notice of the default), meaning that the Administrators shall be “entitled to administer the whole of the Estate at their sole discretion in accordance with their prevailing duties under law”. Four of these, in particular, are worth noting:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. Any failure to adhere to Clause 1 and/or to support the appointment of the [Administrators] as the administrators and/or executors of the Estate in any jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. Any challenge to the appointment of the [Administrators] as the administrators and/or executors of the Estate in any jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c. Any failure to provide full and frank disclosure and/or otherwise assist the [Administrators] with a view to ascertaining, valuing, and/or distributing the assets of the Estate in accordance with Clause 2 above; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">d. Any failure to adhere to the directions of the [Administrators] to step down from any and all positions in relevant companies within the Estate and/or relinquish control of such companies …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Clause 7 provided that the Settlement Agreement would constitute full and final settlement of “all disputes, claims, matters and issues of any kind or nature whatsoever … which have arisen from or in connection with the Will and/or the Estate”. The remaining clauses dealt with various other matters that did not concern the Administrators. After those provisions came the exclusive jurisdiction clause in cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I begin my analysis with the wording of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement, which I reproduce here again for convenience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore. The Parties agree that in respect of all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its existence, validity, breach and enforcement, shall be first submitted to mediation at the Singapore International Mediation Centre and the mediator shall be Mr [xxx] <span class="font-italic">S.C.</span> The Parties further agree that only if the Parties have in good faith carried out the mediation and they have not been able to resolve their dispute, controversy, claim and/or disagreement, then, and in that event only, the Parties shall commence legal proceedings in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 There are two aspects to this clause. The first is expressed in the first sentence, under which the “Parties … submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore”. The second is expressed in the next few sentences, which required that the “Parties” first submit any relevant dispute, <span class="font-italic">etc </span>to mediation, and only if the mediation has been carried out in good faith and the dispute, <span class="font-italic">etc </span>has not yet been resolved, can legal proceedings in Singapore be commenced. The immediate question in relation to the first sentence is this: <span class="font-italic">what</span> have the respondents agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts? In context, it must refer to “all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its existence, validity, breach and enforcement”. On the face of the provision, this could mean that the respondents have agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts <span class="font-italic">either</span> (a) only those matters which only concern the respondents, <span class="font-italic">or</span> (b) <span class="font-italic">any such matters, </span>even where the dispute is with the Administrators, such that no proceedings can be brought against the Administrators in relation to such matters outside of Singapore. If the latter was true, then, cl 19 would purport to confer a benefit onto the Administrators as a third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In this regard, I disagreed with VKC that the plain and ordinary meaning of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement could not bear an interpretation that would purport to benefit the Administrators. She had argued that a plain reading of cl 19 shows that it only applies to the parties to the Settlement Agreement, since there was no reference to the Administrators specifically, or any administrator generally, in cl 19.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, this was not conclusive. The fact that it was the parties to the Settlement Agreement who agreed to submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts was not disputed. The question is <span class="font-italic">what</span> they have submitted to the Singapore courts for determination. VKC’s argument must then be that only disputes <span class="font-italic">as between the respondents</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> as parties to the Settlement Agreement), are submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. But this is not expressly stated in cl 19. While this was certainly a possible interpretation of cl 19, the same could be said about the interpretation that the parties to the Settlement Agreement have also agreed to submit disputes involving the Administrators to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The plain and ordinary meaning of cl 19 did not conclude the analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  In deciding between the two possible interpretations, I then considered the Settlement Agreement as a whole. In my judgment, the latter interpretation, that the respondents have submitted all matters relating to the Settlement Agreement, including matters concerning the Administrators, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, was the correct one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The content of the Settlement Agreement showed that the Administrators were a key part of the functioning of the settlement. Indeed, the vast majority of the substantive clauses dealing with the actual terms and operation of the settlement concerned the Administrators. This was not surprising in this context, since the Estate cannot be dealt with except by administrators duly appointed. Hence, both from the text and context of the Settlement Agreement, it was clear that the respondents, as parties to the Settlement Agreement, clearly envisaged that the Administrators would be the ones putting the Settlement Agreement into effect. Without their participation, none of the substantive provisions in the Settlement Agreement could be implemented. The starting point for all this was the agreement that the Administrators will administer the Estate <span class="font-italic">and </span>that the respondents will do the necessary to effect their appointment, not just in Singapore, but in all jurisdictions: cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement. Clauses 2 and 3, which formed the core of the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the settlement, were clearly drafted with the intention of providing guidance to the Administrators on how they were to then administer the Estate upon appointment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The centrality of the Administrators’ role in the operation of the Settlement Agreement can also be seen in cl 5, which sets out a list of acts that would be treated as material breaches of the Settlement Agreement. If notice of such default was given, and if the default was not remedied or cured within a certain time period, then the respondents were entitled to treat the Settlement Agreement as null and void. The Administrators would thereafter administer the Estate without the Settlement Agreement, and in accordance with the law. The list of acts was primarily concerned with the cooperation with the Administrators: see [36] above. This clause, in my view, showed very clearly that the parties to the Settlement Agreement envisaged that cooperation with the Administrators and facilitation of their work would be a fundamental part of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is convenient for me to deal here with VKC’s argument that the Administrators had consistently maintained in OSP 3 that they were not parties to the Settlement Agreement and were not bound to follow the Settlement Agreement.

</div> As a matter of fact and the history of this case, I did not think this argument was correct. At the outset, the Administrators were the ones who had brought the initial application in OSP 3 for them to be entitled to administer the Estate according to the Settlement Agreement in question. It is certainly true that the Administrators had consistently taken the position that they were not <span class="font-italic">bound</span> as contracting parties, since they were clearly not parties to the Settlement Agreement. But this was simply a fact – they could not have taken any other position. Yet, the Administrators expressed their intention to abide by terms of the Settlement Agreement by seeking prayer 1 in OSP 3. They required an order from court because (1) their initial appointment in 2018 by the High Court Family Division was not on the basis of the Settlement Agreement (which was entered into after their appointments), and (2) abiding by the Settlement Agreement would mean deviating from the terms of the Will. There were also details concerning the sale of assets that they wished to obtain clarifications about. Nothing about the history of this case suggests that the Administrators were, in the words of VKC, “approbating and reprobating”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any case, the question of the effects of contracts on third parties has always distinguished between the <span class="font-italic">obligations</span> under the contract and the <span class="font-italic">benefits</span> under a contract. The CRTA makes clear under s 2 that it is only the <span class="font-italic">benefits</span> that the third party can seek, whereas no provision is made for the enforcement of <span class="font-italic">obligations</span> against third parties. Further, s 2(5) of the CRTA provides expressly that a third party is not prevented from enforcing a term under s 2 just because it is a volunteer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> just because it has not provided any consideration. VKC’s arguments, therefore, are not convincing since the questions of obligation and benefit are to be treated distinctly. The question under s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CRTA is simply whether the term that the third party seeks to enforce purports to confer a benefit on that third party.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having identified the centrality of the Administrators’ role in the Settlement Agreement, it is clear the agreement contemplated that disputes between the Administrators and the respondents or some of them might arise. This was so particularly in relation to cll 2 and 3. While the <span class="font-italic">primary</span> purpose of the Settlement Agreement was to settle the various claims against the Estate, arising out of the conflict between Family [A] and Family [B] primarily, it is easy to see how the conflict would spill over to the Administrators as well because of how the operation of the settlement was inextricably tied up with the Administrators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This was the context in which I interpreted cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. Given the history of conflict and the various legal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, I found that cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement was intended by all parties to channel any future disputes to Singapore for resolution. This would resolve the difficulties of maintaining and defending multiple suits in different jurisdictions, and would also afford the opportunity for a more coherent approach to the Estate, which comprised assets in various countries. The parties agreed for Singapore to be, in the words of the Administrators, the “centre of gravity” for the administration of the Estate thereafter.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The conflicts among the respondents could not be neatly divided from the conflicts that might involve the Administrators. This followed from my conclusions on the centrality of the Administrators to the operation of the settlement. Every substantive decision by the Administrators would inevitably affect the operation of the settlement, and each act of any of the respondents in relation to the Estate would also necessarily affect the Administrators who were in charge of administering the Estate and implementing the settlement. This was a situation where the respondents, as parties to the agreement, had, in that sense, bound themselves up with a third party, the Administrators, <span class="font-italic">whom they expected would then give effect to the Settlement </span><span class="font-italic">Agreement</span>. Indeed, if the Administrators chose not to follow the Settlement Agreement, then all would come to nought. In that situation, conflicts between the respondents would inevitably touch on the Administrators, and conflicts would also arise between the respondents and the Administrators themselves. To take a simple example: if one set of respondents was unhappy with the manner in which the Administrators sold one of the assets to a particular respondent under cl 3 of the Settlement Agreement, the conflict would involve not just that particular respondent, but would necessarily touch upon the Administrators’ acts. Given the structure of the Settlement Agreement, there could be no neat division between the two. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Therefore, when the parties to the Settlement Agreement agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts for “all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement”, I interpreted this to also refer to such matters which concerned the Administrators as well, such that the parties have bound themselves not to proceed against the Administrators in any other jurisdiction for matters falling within cl 19. To continue the example above, if the disgruntled respondents commenced an action against the Administrators for selling that asset, say, in Indonesia, this would clearly undermine the intention of the parties for disputes to be resolved in Singapore, especially because there would be the risk of fragmentation since the <span class="font-italic">particular</span> <span class="font-italic">respondent</span> who purchased the asset could only be proceeded against in Singapore by virtue of cl 19. The parties, for the sake of selecting a single jurisdiction within which to resolve all the matters relating to the Estate, must have intended also to bind themselves not to bring any claims or proceedings in relation to any disputes against the <span class="font-italic">Administrators</span>. Any other conclusion, in my view, would undermine the entire structure of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I turn then to whether, despite cl 19 purporting to confer a benefit on the Administrators, there was any ground for concluding that “on a proper construction of the contract, it appeared that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party”: s 2(2) of the CRTA. As the Court of Appeal recognised, s 2(2) of the CRTA seeks to “distinguish between intended and incidental beneficiaries to a contract, with the latter beneficiaries not being entitled to sue under the contract”: <span class="font-italic">CLAAS</span> ([29] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [29]. In my judgment, it was clear that the Administrators were not just “incidental” beneficiaries to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. I did not believe that VKC has discharged the burden of showing that the construction of the contract shows that the parties did not intend for the term to be enforced by the Administrators – I have addressed the two primary contentions raised at [40] and [44] above, and I further note here that the absence of any reference to the Administrators in cl 19 itself was not fatal: <span class="font-italic">CLAAS</span> at [37]. To the contrary, I found that cl 19 was a key part of an agreement which clearly envisaged a central role for the Administrators in a potentially contentious administration of the Estate. Therefore, I found that s 2(2) of the CRTA did not apply to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On the basis of the arguments above, I found that the Administrators could enforce cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement by virtue of s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CRTA, which gave them the right to enforce the exclusive jurisdiction clause by way of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an injunction: s 2(5) of the CRTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I pause to note that I did not make any decision on whether the <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span> line of cases applied in the present case (see [30] above), although the cases were cited to me. In my view, it was not necessary to consider the principle approved in<span class="font-italic"> Hai Jiang</span> ([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [81] given the application of the CRTA. In any case, I recognised that the High Court had expressed doubts over whether the <span class="font-italic">Sea Premium</span> principle would apply to a tortious claim in another jurisdiction when the plaintiff in the foreign proceedings was not relying on the contract which contained the exclusive jurisdiction clause, and where there was no risk of fragmentation since no contractual claim was also being brought elsewhere (<span class="font-italic">Hai Jiang</span> at [84]). However, I make no further comment since it was not necessary for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Does the present case fall within the terms of the exclusive jurisdiction clause?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The next issue of construction was whether the Indonesian Proceedings fell within the scope of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. The parties to the Settlement Agreement had agreed to submit to the Singapore courts “all disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to its existence, validity, breach and enforcement”. Since I had already found that cl 19 included such disputes in relation to the Administrators as well, the question was whether the subject-matter of the Indonesian Proceedings would fall within cl 19. VKC argued that it did not, claiming that cl 19 would not extend to the “reckless behaviour” of the Administrators which constituted a civil wrong that has no connection to the Settlement Agreement.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The parties had agreed to enter into this Settlement Agreement, presumably because they considered it to be in their interests to have the settlement so that they could obtain what they wanted from the Estate. Part of that settlement was to agree to submit all the “disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements arising out of or in connection with this Agreement” to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. There was no reason to take a narrow view in interpreting cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement, since clearly one of the benefits of cl 19 in the context of the settlement was to prevent multi-jurisdictional disputes from continuing. It would defeat that purpose to take a narrow view of this provision, for example, to refer only to claims made under the Settlement Agreement <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, since that would make too much depend on the exact contours of each claim that an enterprising party could get around. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This was supported also by the specific facts surrounding the Settlement Agreement. As the recital to the agreement stated, at the time when the respondents entered into mediation, there were proceedings afoot in Singapore and Indonesia. Further, under cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement, it was clearly envisaged that the Estate might comprise assets in multiple jurisdictions, with specific reference to Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and China. This was an Estate that was multi-jurisdictional, and it made eminent sense for the parties to agree to channel all disputes to a single jurisdiction for resolution. This supported a generous interpretation of cl 19, as I found that it could not have been the parties’ intentions to allow multiple proceedings in multiple jurisdictions to be brought simply on the basis of minor distinctions in the nature of the legal actions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It was also telling that cl 19 did not make reference to specific legal proceedings or legal claims, but only referred broadly to “disputes, controversies, claims or disagreements”. These were the <span class="font-italic">facts underlying</span> legal proceedings, not the legal proceedings themselves, and the clause did not specify the exact type of legal claim would fall outside its scope. The focus, therefore, should be on the facts underlying the foreign proceedings, rather than the legal characteristics of the action itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the light of this context, I held that the dispute in the Indonesian Proceedings should be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore courts as cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement applied. I had previously held that a dispute with the Administrators would fall within the scope of cl 19 (see [49] above). As for the nature of the dispute itself, I found that this was a “dispute … arising out of or in connection with this Agreement”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, the Notices were published in June 2019, when the Settlement Agreement had already been entered into, and after OSP 3 had been filed in the Singapore court. I accepted that the Administrators’ actions in Indonesia, which were concurrent with the application in OSP 3, and after actions were taken in May 2019 to publish similar notices in Singapore, showed that they were seeking, as far as they were able to, implement the Settlement Agreement. Put another way, if the Settlement Agreement had not existed and the respondents had not agreed that the Administrators would be the administrators of the Estate in Indonesia, I doubted that the Administrators would have taken any steps in Indonesia. The acts of the Administrators, therefore, arose out of, or in connection with the Settlement Agreement, and any dispute concerning those acts would similarly be so related to the agreement as to fall within cl 19.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Second, even though they were not administrators in Indonesia yet, c1 1 of the Settlement Agreement provided that the respondents were to take the necessary steps to secure the Administrators’ appointment in Indonesia. In that regard, any complaints that the respondents would have against the Administrators’ actions prior to their appointment as administrators in Indonesia would necessarily involve the background of the respondents’ agreement to facilitate and effect those appointments. As the Administrators noted, they felt that the Notices were required because the respondents had not been cooperative in facilitating their appointments in Indonesia.

</div> While I do not make a finding on this either way, it was clear to me that these allegations pertaining to the respondents’ obligations under cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement were inextricably related to the Administrators’ decision to publish the Notices. The dispute, therefore, was certainly “in connection with” the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Third, in terms of the damage allegedly caused by the Administrators’ actions, this must be understood in terms of VKC’s entitlements under the Settlement Agreement and the Will.

</div> However, VKC is also a member of Family [A], which was entitled to the payment of the lump sum under cl 2 of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was agreed to be in full and final settlement of all the disputes that the respondents had against each other in relation to the Estate and/or Will (<span class="font-italic">per </span>cl 7), which meant that Family [A] (and all its members) were to wait for the payment under cl 2.a., which sum they agreed “constitutes and/or is a complete and exhaustive quantification and representation of their full entitlement to the Estate” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> cl 2.b.). In that sense, VKC’s entitlement under the Will at the time was simply her share in the payment due to Family [A] under the Settlement Agreement. Any “damage” allegedly caused would appear to have been to her entitlement under the <span class="font-italic">Settlement Agreement</span>, which means that the dispute clearly fell within cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. In substance, her complaint was that the Administrators’ actions had jeopardised the payment that was due to her and the rest of Family [A], since, under the Settlement Agreement, <span class="font-italic">that</span> was to be their entitlement to the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Given the above features of the Indonesian Proceedings, I found that the dispute giving rise to the said action clearly fell within cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. It followed that VKC’s act in bringing the Indonesian Proceedings was in breach of cl 19, which the Administrators were entitled to enforce. As a result, it would generally follow that the anti-suit injunction should be granted, in the absence of strong reasons not to: <span class="font-italic">Sun</span><span class="font-italic"> Travels</span> ([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [68]. For completeness, I note that VKC did not allege that there was “dilatoriness or other unconscionable conduct” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Bingham’s leading judgment in <span class="font-italic">Donohue v Armco Inc</span> [2002] 1 All ER 749 (“<span class="font-italic">Donohue</span>”) at [24]) that would have prevented the Administrators from seeking equitable relief.

The burden generally lies on the party seeking the anti-suit injunction to show that Singapore is the more appropriate forum for the dispute: <span class="font-italic">Trane</span> at [33]. However, in my view, the burden would shift where there is an exclusive jurisdiction clause and an anti-suit injunction is sought. Where there is such a clause, it would appear that the burden would be on the party who is resisting the anti-suit injunction <span class="font-italic">despite</span> the contractual agreement to show a <span class="font-italic">strong reason</span> for the court not to grant the relief.

</div> I found the state of the evidence on Indonesian law in this case to be insufficient for me to make a finding either way. I proceeded on the assumption that the Indonesian courts could hear the Indonesian Proceedings.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shape of the litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I was of the view that the shape of the litigation pointed to Singapore being the more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, there were already on-going proceedings in Singapore concerning the Administrators’ role in relation to the Estate in OSP 3. While not strictly speaking <span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span>, since OSP 3 did not concern the torts alleged in the Indonesian Proceedings, I was of the opinion that the Indonesian Proceedings could not be considered apart from OSP 3. As the Administrators were not parties to the Settlement Agreement, ORC 253 in OSP 3 was the means by which they were able to and became compelled to implement the Settlement Agreement (as far as they were able to). Relevant to the present dispute was the subject-matter of prayer 1 in SUM 96, <span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the indemnity that was ordered in ORC 253. The indemnity was relevant because the actions of the Administrators were, in my view, done as part of their appointment in Singapore and their obligation to implement the Settlement Agreement. In fact, matters like the Indonesian Proceedings were exactly why something like the indemnity in ORC 253 was called for. Although the tort was allegedly committed in Indonesia, even if liability were established there, the Administrators would seek an indemnity from the Estate (as was done in this case), and that application would have to be made in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Second, although the Indonesian Proceedings involved only the Administrators and VKC, if what VKC alleged was true – that the Administrators’ acts had reduced the value of the Estate available for distribution to the beneficiaries – then <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the respondents would also have been affected by the tort. If that were the case, then the most appropriate step would have been for <span class="font-italic">all the respondents</span> to be joined to the Indonesian Proceedings. Similarly, and related to the first point above, if the Administrators sought an indemnity for the Indonesian Proceedings, the other respondents would also have to be joined. Furthermore, the Administrators had good ground for asserting that they had published the Notices after being prompted to take further actions in Indonesia to preserve the Estate by Family [B], as indicated in a letter sent by their solicitors to the Administrators’ solicitors dated 24 May 2019.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Any joinder, however, would then run into the problem of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the other respondents, since it is clear that they have agreed for any disputes arising from or in connection with the Settlement Agreement to be submitted for mediation in Singapore first, following which they would then be confined to bringing legal proceedings in Singapore. A bifurcated action of sorts where only the Administrators were proceeded against in Indonesia, while the respondents were then proceeded against by the Administrators in Singapore, made little sense. In fact, given that all the respondents have already been part of proceedings in Singapore, and they have agreed to cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement, the dispute between VKC and the Administrators can be viewed as ancillary to the overall administration of the Estate, which had its centre of gravity in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Third, VKC’s claims in the Indonesian Proceedings necessarily touched on the Settlement Agreement because her argument was that her entitlement was affected by the Notices being published in Indonesia. The issue of the scope of her entitlement would require an examination of the Will and the Settlement Agreement, and how they interacted (see [60] above), even if just to say that the entitlement under the Will continues despite the Settlement Agreement. At the same time, any finding of the Indonesian courts on the scope of the entitlements under the Will or Settlement Agreement may give rise to a risk of fragmentation since the other respondents have not been (and arguably cannot be, by virtue of cl 19) joined to the Indonesian Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Relatedly, the Administrators would claim, as they have, that they were acting with a view towards their eventual appointment as administrators in Indonesia by virtue of cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement. Insofar as any lack of cooperation was evident from VKC or any other respondent, that would necessarily have an impact on the operation of the Settlement Agreement by virtue of cl 5, since one of the “material breach[es]” listed is the failure to  “support the appointment of the [Administrators] as the administrators and/or executors of the Estate in <span class="font-italic">any </span>jurisdiction” [emphasis added]. As that would affect the interests of all of the other respondents, including other members of Family [A], it would be more appropriate for all of the respondents to be involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Hence, the overall shape of the litigation showed that the dispute between VKC and the Administrators in Indonesia could not be neatly separated from issues pertaining to ORC 253 in Singapore, the Settlement Agreement, and the interests of all the other respondents in the proceedings and the Estate. In this case, given that the Indonesian Proceedings were based effectively on the acts of the Administrators in relation <span class="font-italic">to the Estate</span>, even if they were not strictly speaking the appointed administrators in Indonesia, I found that the overall shape of the litigation pointed strongly in favour of Singapore being the more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Connections to relevant events and transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Similarly, while the Notices were published in Indonesia, I found that the relevant events and transaction had a closer connection to Singapore than to Indonesia. First, as I have already noted above at [58], the Administrators published the Notices in Indonesia <span class="font-italic">because</span> of the Settlement Agreement, especially cl 1, and in the context of their concurrent application in Singapore in OSP 3 to have the Settlement Agreement formally recognised as governing a large part of their obligations as administrators. This suggested that the <span class="font-italic">entire factual background</span> of the Notices was derived from the prior proceedings in Singapore and the Settlement Agreement. Without that Settlement Agreement, the Administrators simply would not have published the Notices at all. Second, the proper interpretation of the Notices, and the state of mind of the Administrators in relation to their acts, could not be understood apart from the Settlement Agreement and the on-going proceedings in Singapore. In that sense, the reasons for publishing the Notices primarily centred on what was happening in Singapore. Balanced against this was the fact that, in my view, the only relevant event in Indonesia was the publication of the Notices. No affidavit evidence has been given of any facts subsequent to the publication of the Notices that would be of relevance to the dispute.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 While I recognised that as a general principle, in a tortious claim, the place where the alleged tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum, this is not conclusive  and is “only one of the factors, albeit a significant factor, to be taken into account in the overall analysis”: <span class="font-italic">Trane</span> at [42], citing <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”) at [40]. In my judgment, the nature of the tort and the context in which the tort was alleged to have been committed, together with the other factors identified above in relation to the shape of the litigation, point away from Indonesia as the natural forum, even if it was the place where the alleged tort occurred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 VKC placed significant weight on the fact that the applicable law in relation to the tortious claim would be Indonesian law, being the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. The Administrators did not deny that Indonesian law would govern that action.

</div>
</div> While this was a significant factor in favour of Indonesia as the more appropriate forum, I was of the view that there were particular elements of this case that reduced the weight to be given to this factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 While the alleged tort was governed by Indonesian law, it would be necessary to interpret the Settlement Agreement in order for the court to arrive at a proper understanding of VKC’s interest in the Estate, since that agreement purported to provide for the entitlements of all members of Family [A] by way of cl 2 and the payment of the agreed sum. In that regard, the questions relating to the Settlement Agreement would be governed by Singapore law, as provided for in cl 18 of the Settlement Agreement. Similarly, in relation to the Administrators’ explanation for their actions, this could not be understood apart from the effect of cl 1 and the on-going proceedings in Singapore, which were governed by Singapore law. As a matter of principle, as summarised in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2017) at para 75.093, citing <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span> at [85]: “It is common for more than one legal issue to arise in a dispute, and the weight of this factor may be reduced or even cancelled if different issues are governed by different laws.” In my view, this principle applied in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It was also, in my view, relevant that the parties had already foreseen that Indonesia might be a forum in which legal proceedings could be brought. As noted above, the Settlement Agreement was entered into by the respondents when legal proceedings in Indonesia were on-going, and the Settlement Agreement was intended, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to bring to an end those proceedings. In doing so, it also provided for exclusive jurisdiction in Singapore under cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement. The parties had <span class="font-italic">already</span> known that some disputes might be governed by Indonesian law, and it was envisaged that steps may be taken in Indonesia to implement the settlement (per cll 1, 2 and 3 of the Settlement Agreement) but they nevertheless decided to submit all those disputes relating to the Settlement Agreement (which governed their entitlements to the Estate) to the Singapore courts. Therefore, I did not give significant weight to the applicable law since I did not consider it appropriate to enable VKC to avoid the bargain made under the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal connections of parties and witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I did not find this factor to be significant in the present case. Neither the Administrators nor VKC pointed to any particular witnesses in either Singapore or Indonesia that would be needed for the dispute to be tried. The key facts relating to the alleged tort were largely uncontested, and it was not clear from the affidavits what further witnesses would be required. As for the parties themselves, I recognised that the Administrators are based in Singapore while VKC appears to be living in Indonesia.

</div>
</div> I therefore found this to be a neutral factor in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on natural forum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my judgment, the most material factors in this case were the overall shape of the litigation, and the connection of the events and transactions to Singapore. These two factors clearly indicated that the Indonesian Proceedings were, in substance, concerned with the administration of the Estate, which was centred in Singapore. The Administrators’ acts in Indonesia, which were done with a view towards their eventual appointment as administrators in that jurisdiction pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, could not be understood or assessed except in relation to the on-going proceedings in Singapore and the Settlement Agreement, both as a matter of the applicable background, and in terms of the remedies that the Administrators would seek against the Estate and/or the respondents. The resolution of the dispute over the publication of the Notices would necessarily involve an interpretation and assessment of the Settlement Agreement, which was governed by Singapore law, and which would affect the interests of all the other respondents. At the same time, the other respondents could not be joined to the Indonesian Proceedings because of cl 19 of the Settlement Agreement unless that was waived by the other respondents. There was a real risk of fragmentation in the interpretation and application of the Settlement Agreement. Thus, while the Administrators conceded that the applicable law to the tortious claim was Indonesian law, and while the place the tort occurred is given significant weight in the assessment of the natural forum, I concluded that in this case, the various factors identified above clearly pointed to Singapore as the more appropriate forum.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Under the authority of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>([63] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which dealt with stays of proceedings, after considering which forum is the more appropriate one, the court should also consider whether justice requires that a stay be refused. I deal with the issue of justice as part of the broader analysis of whether to grant the anti-suit injunction at [87]-–[89] below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Vexation or oppression</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 When it comes to an anti-suit injunction based on an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the strict test of vexation and oppression does not apply, and it is not necessary to prove such unconscionable conduct before an injunction is granted: <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [68]. In the following, I discuss whether the Indonesian Proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the Administrators as it formed a further reason as to why I was inclined to grant the injunction, and also showed why there was no strong reason against granting the injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Trane</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) summarised the applicable principles as follows (at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would observe that the courts have held that there is vexation or oppression in situations such as the following: where a party is subjected to oppressive procedures in the foreign court; bad faith in the institution of the foreign proceedings; commencing the foreign proceedings for no good reason; commencing proceedings that are bound to fail; and extreme inconvenience caused by the foreign proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Dicey on The Conflict of Laws</span> ([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 12-073). These situations can also be suitably described by the word <span class="font-italic">unconscionable</span>. In this respect, the following <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> of Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Evergreen International SA</span> ([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is helpful (at [41]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question for consideration is whether the conduct of the defendants in continuing with the Belgium proceedings is vexatious or oppressive and is hence unconscionable. Lord Hobhouse in <span class="font-italic">Turner v Grovit</span> [2002] 1 WLR 107 at 117 explained that the power to make the restraining order is dependent upon there being wrongful (‘unconscionable’) conduct of the party to be restrained of which the applicant is entitled to complain and has a legitimate interest in seeking to prevent. He said that the word ‘unconscionable’ is derived from English equity law. Injunctive relief is based on equity. The words ‘vexatious’ or ‘oppressive’ have been used in relation to the conduct of the party to be restrained. They are derived from ‘the basic principle of justice’. As the complaint is that unconscionable, vexatious or oppressive conduct lies in the pursuit of proceedings in Belgium, an assessment or evaluation of the conduct complained of and the nature of the plaintiffs’ rights or interests that are being infringed or threatened is needed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The central fact that rendered the continuation of the Indonesian Proceedings vexatious and oppressive was, in my judgment, the attempt by VKC to get around the Settlement Agreement. More than just the fact that VKC had agreed to an exclusive jurisdiction clause which she was now attempting to resile from, it appeared to me that in bringing the action against the Administrators, VKC was undermining the substantive settlement arrived at in the Settlement Agreement. As I have already noted, VKC’s approach to the proceedings in Indonesia has been to rely on her entitlement under the Will, claiming damages against the Administrators for that entitlement. However, there was no mention of the <span class="font-italic">Settlement Agreement </span>in the letter sent to the Administrators by VKC’s lawyers or in any of the documents exhibited.

</div>
</div> I found this to be unsatisfactory. This raised significant doubts in my mind as to the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of VKC in bringing the Indonesian Proceedings, since it appeared that she was seeking to enforce, indirectly, her entitlement under the Will rather than the agreed share that Family [A] would receive under the Settlement Agreement. Further, her failure to join the rest of the respondents in the Indonesian Proceedings was another indication that the proceedings would be vexatious and oppressive to the Administrators. There was the issue of the indemnity and liability (since Family [B] had invited the Administrators to take further steps in Indonesia

</div>
</div>), and also the risk that the positions of the other respondents, especially Family [B] and the unrepresented beneficiaries, might be affected by whatever interpretation VKC proposed to the Indonesian courts. This would be true of both the Will and the Settlement Agreement, since in order to arrive at a conclusion as to VKC’s entitlement to the Estate, both instruments would need to be considered. That would then have worrying implications for the Administrators if they later, under cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement, were properly appointed as administrators in Indonesia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 This placed them in an invidious position. If the Indonesian Proceedings continued, and the court in Indonesia arrived at an interpretation of the Will and Settlement Agreement that was only binding between them and VKC (assuming the rules of issue estoppel applied in the same way), that would render their work in Indonesia and Singapore more difficult <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the other respondents. Any actions they took to conform to the findings of the Indonesian court in relation to the Will and Settlement Agreement could then expose them to liability to, or at least complaints from, the other respondents, resulting in further costs and delays in the administration of the Estate. Given that a significant part of the Deceased’s Estate was in Indonesian assets, this would have been an extremely inconvenient and unjust position. This is further compounded by the fact that (as I observed above at [69]) cl 19 would prevent VKC from joining the other respondents in the Indonesian Proceedings. What VKC was doing in Indonesia threatened to undermine the coherence of the settlement, albeit indirectly through an action in tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I recognised the force of some of the Administrators’ arguments that the claim in the Indonesian Proceedings lacked any merit at all. However, I also recognised, as VKC argued, that the appropriate response could be to apply to the Indonesian courts to strike out the claim: see also <span class="font-italic">Trane</span> at [48], and that the lack of merit alleged would not <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> lead to a finding that the continuation of proceedings would be vexatious and oppressive. Hence, I decided to place greater weight on the factors identified above in coming to my conclusion. In any case, I also considered that on the basis of the evidence before me, I could not come to a firm conclusion on the merits of the Indonesian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the reasons above, I found that it would be unconscionable for VKC to maintain the Indonesian Proceedings in the light of the Settlement Agreement that she was a party to, and that the continuation of the proceedings would be vexatious and oppressive to the Administrators who were seeking to implement the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Injustice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 While the injustice that might be caused to VKC was not raised as a separate argument, VKC claimed, in passing, that she would not be able to seek a remedy for the alleged tort in Singapore, and hence, ordering the anti-suit injunction would be unjust as it would deprive her of any remedy for the wrong allegedly caused.
