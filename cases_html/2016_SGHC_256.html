The plaintiff estimated that between October 2015 and April 2016, US$9.4m had been diverted to TNI Ltd and away from the plaintiff.

The Applicants’ grounds for contending that Vietnam was the natural forum were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Most of the facts in relation to the allegedly fraudulent transfer of shares occurred in Vietnam; the alleged conspiracy was formed in Vietnam. Breaches of the Supply Agreement and the stealing of company seals and business registration certificates occurred in Vietnam.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Most of the witnesses who had to testify were located in Vietnam and they were not compellable to testify in a Singapore court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  There was a multiplicity of proceedings such that there was a risk of conflicting judgments. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The proper law in relation to the various torts and the Supply Agreement was Vietnamese law since it bore the closest and most real connection with the alleged agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The plaintiff, on the other hand, resisted the stay on the following grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Vietnam has no jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim in conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The domicile of the parties pointed to Singapore as the more appropriate forum. The first defendant was a Singapore company. Thao was at all material times managing the affairs of the first defendant. Tuyet and Van were employees of the first defendant. Further, Tuyet was a permanent resident of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The non-party witnesses were all located in Singapore and thus the compellability of witnesses was not a relevant factor in determining whether Vietnam was a more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The substance of the tort of conspiracy occurred in Singapore. The conspiracy began with Thao taking control of the first defendant and then continued with Thao inducing the first defendant to breach the Supply Agreement. These acts happened in Singapore making it the place of the tort.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The divorce proceedings between Vu and Thao were wholly separate and distinct from the Suit. The other proceedings were commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the Applicants’ application for a stay, and thus an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The plaintiff would not be able to enforce a judgment obtained in Vietnam even if the Vietnamese court declared that the purported transfer of the shares in the first defendant was fraudulently procured. Any judgment would not be for a sum of money but a mere declaration that the purported transfer was invalid. Such a judgment could not be enforced in Singapore because Vietnam was not party to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265, 2001 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Principles for granting a stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The principles for granting a stay of proceedings on the basis of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> are well established. At the first of two stages, the critical question is whether there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore: see <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank v Dresdner</span>”) at [26]. Put another way, the inquiry is which forum has the most <span class="font-italic">real and substantial connection</span> with the dispute. Generally, the court will consider the following non-exhaustive factors: (a) personal connections, (b) connections to events and transactions, (c) governing law, (d) other proceedings and (e) shape of the litigation: see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO </span><span class="font-italic">Minerals</span>”) at [42]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 If there is another available forum that is more appropriate than Singapore, the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test requires the court to consider whether justice nevertheless requires that a stay should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be granted. This stage is only engaged if in the first stage of the inquiry, the court ascertains that there is indeed a more appropriate forum than Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stage 1 of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold">: </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Was Vietnam a more appropriate forum?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assets, events and transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Here, the personal connections of the parties to the dispute weighed in favour of Vietnam. All the parties, with the exception of the first defendant, were either Vietnamese nationals or Vietnamese entities. The plaintiff pointed to the fact that Tuyet was a Singapore permanent resident, but this was not of much significance given her Vietnamese nationality and the personal links of all the other defendants to Vietnam.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I turn now to the assets, events and transactions from which the dispute was said to have arisen out of. The plaintiff’s case was that it owned the first defendant arising from an acquisition, now disputed by Thao,that occurred in Vietnam and was governed by Vietnamese law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Thao, Tuyet and/or Tu, it was contended, entered into a conspiracy to cause loss to the plaintiff. This began with Thao’s allegedly fraudulent acquisition of 7,520,800 shares in the first defendant from the plaintiff. It was not disputed that a blank share transfer form was drawn up in Singapore and sent to Tu who was in Vietnam. Tu was alleged to have wrongfully affixed the plaintiff’s seal on the blank transfer form before arranging for it to be sent back in a sealed envelope to Thao in Singapore. Thao’s evidence, which was supported by Tuyet, who signed the share transfer form as a witness, was that Vu’s signature was already on the share transfer form when the sealed envelope was opened. The Applicants thus submitted that any forgery must have occurred in Vietnam. The plaintiff disputed this claiming that the forgery occurred in Singapore. In my view, it could not be determined with reasonable certainty, based on affidavit evidence alone, <span class="font-italic">where</span> the alleged forgery occurred. Nor was the place of forgery fundamental to the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff’s case was that the conspiracy to cause loss to the plaintiff continued, with TN Instant Coffee and TNI Ltd (both Vietnamese companies) joining in as co-conspirators to induce the first defendant to breach the Supply Agreement. It was clear that the Supply Agreement had more connections to Vietnam as compared to Singapore. The alleged terms of the Supply Agreement, was that the plaintiff, acting through a <span class="font-italic">Vietnamese</span> branch, SCF, would directly ship from <span class="font-italic">Vietnam</span> processed instant coffee products under the G7 brand to international clients. All records of shipments would be kept by the plaintiff in Vietnam. Payments from Guangxi and Dongxing were made to the plaintiff in Vietnam through SCF. Other clients made payment to the first defendant who would retain part of those monies as profit and remit the rest to the plaintiff in Vietnam. In addition, the first defendant was required to provide the plaintiff with certain documents to allow it to qualify for a tax refund in Vietnam. Further, the sales contracts with the international clients provided as a means of dispute resolution for arbitration by the Foreign Trade and Arbitration Committee at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Ho Chi Minh City.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This showed that even the sales contracts with international clients that the first defendant (which was the only significant link that the dispute had with Singapore) had entered into were more closely connected to <span class="font-italic">Vietnam</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff averred that the conspiracy to induce the breach of the Supply Agreement flowed from the initial conspiracy to deprive the plaintiff of the shares, and concomitantly, control, of the first defendant. Thao and the co-conspirators were said to have caused TN Instant Coffee to replace SCF in Vietnam as the shipper of processed instant coffee products. Then there was the matter of the diversion of proceeds paid by Guangxi and Dongxing to TNI Ltd when they were supposed to be paid to the plaintiff. This also occurred in Vietnam. The first defendant also stopped providing the required documents to the plaintiff preventing it from obtaining the tax refund in Vietnam.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Finally, the plaintiff contended that Van joined the conspiracy and together with Thao, Tu and two unidentified men, broke into the plaintiff’s premises in <span class="font-italic">Vietnam</span> to steal business registration certificates, seals and seal specimen registration certificates of the plaintiff (including those of its various subsidiaries and associated companies). Thao then used these seals to disrupt the business of TN Instant Coffee, indirectly disrupting the plaintiff’s business, by closing factories in <span class="font-italic">Vietnam</span> and prohibiting key employees from entering the premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Considering all of the above, I found that there was a preponderance of connecting factors, in terms of the assets, events and transactions related to the dispute, to Vietnam. The only significant factor that connected the dispute to Singapore was the fact that the first defendant was a Singapore company, and its shares were assets in Singapore. Other than this, all the other significant events occurred in, or were at least connected with, Vietnam. Similarly most, if not all, of the material transactions were more closely connected to Vietnam. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Choice of law and the place of the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The main cause of action in this suit is the tort of conspiracy. The choice of law rule that Singapore courts apply for torts is the double actionability rule: the tort must be actionable under both the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori </span>and the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> loci delicti</span> (see <span class="font-italic">JIO </span><span class="font-italic">Minerals</span> at [88], <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw </span><span class="font-italic">Investments</span>”) at [53]. In this case, the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence as to whether the defendants’ actions constituted a tort in Vietnam, because they were of the view that the place of the tort was Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2013] 1 SLR 1254 at [77], the High Court applied the following factors in determining the place of tort for a claim in conspiracy: (a) the identity, importance and location of the conspirators; (b) the place(s) of any agreement or combination; (c) the nature and place(s) of the concerted action; (d) the nature and place(s) of any unlawful act or means; and (d) the plaintiff’s location and the place(s) where he or it suffered loss. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It followed from my analysis of the personal connections and location of the parties, the various events and transactions comprising the tort, and the place where the plaintiff suffered damage, that the place of the tort is Vietnam. The connection of the true dispute between the parties to Singapore, apart from the fact that the first defendant, the plaintiff’s conduit for international sales, was a Singapore company, was rather tenuous. The first defendant’s liability under its supply agreement with the plaintiff was as a subsidiary company of the Vietnamese plaintiff. Most of the losses that the plaintiff said it suffered occurred in Vietnam. While the loss of the shares in the first defendant was suffered in Singapore, these were valuable only because their ownership entailed control of the export of the plaintiff’s products; the effect of that loss was felt in Vietnam. The place where the tort occurred is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for determining the claim, unless that place was purely fortuitous (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [39]). In this case, the place of the tort was not purely fortuitous and is Vietnam. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Availability of witnesses, convenience and expense</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 At the outset, I should state that I did not consider the availability of witnesses to be a weighty factor in favour of either party. Witnesses considered in this regard generally referred to non-party witnesses (see <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight International Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar and others</span> [2016] 2 SLR 841 at [96]). Further, in <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank v Dresdner</span>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [69]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In considering the location of witnesses as a factor, the court must bear in mind the issues in the action. Only witnesses whose evidence is potentially material and relevant to the issues in the action should be reckoned. … Moreover, location of witnesses is only really significant in relation to third-party witnesses who are not in the employ of the party as it could give rise to issues of compellability (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> ([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [19]). … We are conscious that in this technologically-advanced age, the convenience of witnesses who may be located in a different jurisdiction should also be considered against the easy availability of video conferencing (see <span class="font-italic">Peters Roger May v </span><span class="font-italic">Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</span> [2006] 2 SLR 381 at [26] and [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Most of the material witnesses to the Suit were either in the employ of Thao or Vu and thus did not give rise to issues of compellability. The Applicants submitted that Le Tan Tai, who was the one who brought the share transfer form from Vietnam to Singapore, and Le Hanh Thi Bich, the secretary of the plaintiff who affixed the plaintiff’s seal on the share transfer form, were not compellable to testify in Singapore. However, from the facts that were before me, it was evident that these two potential witnesses were willing to do the bidding of either Vu or Thao. I thus did not place significant weight on this factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proceedings in Vietnam </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Applicants submitted that I should also have regard to the proceedings that had been commenced in Vietnam. They contended that there was a real risk that Singapore courts and Vietnamese courts could arrive at inconsistent findings of <span class="font-italic">fact</span>. The proceedings which had been commenced in Vietnam were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Divorce proceedings between Vu and Thao.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Arbitration proceedings at the Vietnam International Arbitration Centre (“VIAC Arbitration”): Thao commenced arbitration claiming, in the main, that the transfer of her 520,800 shares in the first defendant under the 2011 Contract was invalid since the requisite licence from the Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Investment (“MPI”) was not obtained. Thao had also commenced civil proceedings in the People’s Court of Ho Chi Minh City seeking to invalidate the transfer for the same reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Civil proceedings in the People’s Court of Ho Chi Minh City. In these proceedings Thao was suing for wrongful dismissal as Permanent Vice General Director of the plaintiff in April 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I will consider the effect of each of these proceedings in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the divorce proceedings, Thao sought division of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, 37,500,000 shares in the plaintiff. The plaintiff submitted that the divorce proceedings were wholly separate from the Suit. It pointed to its expert report on Vietnamese law which stated that property belonging to the plaintiff was separate and distinct from Vu’s personal assets and would thus be excluded from the matrimonial pool of assets. Also, the plaintiff had brought the Suit in its “corporate capacity to recover control of” the first defendant and this was wholly distinct from the divorce proceedings initiated by Thao against Vu, in the latter’s “personal capacity”.

If that was indeed the case, and as pointed out by the Applicant’s Vietnamese law expert,

</div> it was likely that the Vietnamese court hearing the matrimonial dispute would inquire into circumstances surrounding the alleged forgery. There was thus a possible overlap in terms of the factual findings that the Vietnamese and Singapore court would have to make on this particular issue. This overlap might result in both jurisdictions arriving at findings of fact that are inconsistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The VIAC Arbitration (and the related civil proceedings) and civil proceedings for wrongful dismissal were commenced after this suit was started, and the plaintiff submitted that little or no weight should be given to the existence of such proceedings because they were an abuse of process commenced to bolster the argument that there was another more appropriate forum elsewhere. The plaintiff relied on the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">De </span><span class="font-italic">Dampierre v De Dampierre</span> [1988] 1 AC 92 (at 108) where Lord Goff of Chieveley pointed out that while foreign proceedings <span class="font-italic">may</span> be relevant to the inquiry of whether a stay should be granted, they may be of no relevance at all if, for example, one party had commenced the proceedings for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competing jurisdiction or the proceedings had not passed beyond the stage of the initiating process (see also <span class="font-italic">Peters Roger May v </span><span class="font-italic">Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</span> [2006] 2 SLR 281 at [33] and <span class="font-italic">Exxonmobil</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Bombay Dyeing &amp; Manufacturing Co Ltd</span> [2007] SGHC 137 at [18]). In <span class="font-italic">The Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Seltron Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 757 (“<span class="font-italic">The Hooghly Mills</span>”), for example, while the proceedings in India had been filed in June 1993, the writ was only served by the respondent in January 1994, some three months after the writ in Singapore had been issued and served. The High Court opined that the delay in service of the writ indicated that there was no true desire on the part of the respondent to litigate in India (at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On the facts, I noted that the VIAC Arbitration was commenced by Thao slightly belatedly; she had known by 26 November 2015 (the date of the writ) that the plaintiff was claiming for the return of its shares in the first defendant. She only commenced the VIAC Arbitration on 9 June 2016. Further, the facts in relation to the VIAC Arbitration were known to her in 2011. The mere fact, however, that proceedings were commenced belatedly, by itself, could not show that those proceedings were defensive in nature and were commenced just to demonstrate the existence of a competing jurisdiction. In <span class="font-italic">The Hooghly Mills</span>, there was clear evidence before the court that the respondent had not pursued its claim with the expected rigour, as seen from the belated service of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the VIAC Arbitration, and as part of her defence to the present suit, Thao was claiming that the transfer of the first defendant’s shares pursuant to the 2011 Contract was invalid for failure to obtain the requisite licence from the MPI, as required under the terms of the contract. In my view, any findings that had to be made on this particular issue necessitated an inquiry into Vietnamese policy on the effect of the MPI licence. As a result, those specific issues were more suited to determination by a Vietnamese tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thao’s claim for wrongful dismissal, on the other hand, lacked conviction. This was commenced on 27 July 2016, shortly after the filing of SUM 3356. It related to her dismissal in April 2015 before the alleged fraud occurred and was of marginal relevance to the suit at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  Be that as it may, there was a real risk that the Vietnamese and Singapore courts may reach contrasting <span class="font-italic">findings of fact</span><span class="font-italic"> on material issues</span>. <span class="font-italic">In the light of the other factors pointing to Vietnam as the natural forum</span>, it was more just and efficient for all the players to be brought together in that one forum for the adjudication of all their disputes. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Fatt Cheung and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 (see [44]–[46]), the Court of Appeal held that although the causes of action in Singapore and Malaysia were different, the trial courts would have to traverse much the same ground. In the result the High Court’s order for a stay pending outcome of the Malaysian proceedings promoted international comity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on stage 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having considered the factors relevant to stage one of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, I found that the dispute was clearly more closely connected with Vietnam. Vietnam was clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute in the Suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stage 2 of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold">: Whether justice requires that a stay not be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At the second stage, the onus was on the plaintiff to show circumstances which made it just for a stay <span class="font-italic">not </span>to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff’s principal contention at the second stage was that it would be severely prejudiced because the Vietnamese courts did not have territorial jurisdiction over the first defendant. Further, it submitted that any judgment it may obtain in respect of the fraudulent transfer of the first defendant’s shares would not be binding on a Singapore company. The plaintiff would not be able to obtain an enforceable declaration that it was the owner of those shares. Further, the plaintiff pointed to the fact that it sought orders under s 194 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2010 Rev Ed) which concerns the power of the court to rectify the register of members for<span class="font-italic"> </span>companies (see s 196A and 196C of the Companies Act). It argued that it would not be able to obtain such orders in Vietnam.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Applicants’ expert in Vietnamese law disputed the fact that the Vietnamese court only had jurisdiction over entities within the territory of Vietnam. Further, they submitted that there was no juridical disadvantage to have the actions and complaints tried in Vietnam as it was the natural forum to decide all the disputes between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my judgment, the reasons advanced by the plaintiff were not sufficient to justify a refusal of a stay. Nevertheless, as the first defendant is a Singapore company, and it was disputed as to whether the remedy under the Companies Act was necessary, these proceedings could be stayed pending the related proceedings in Vietnam, to leave the plaintiff to return, if necessary, to the Singapore courts to obtain its remedy under s 194 of the Companies Act or to effect the transfer of the first defendant’s shares between the plaintiff and Thao. Such an arrangement was in my view just as it gave effect to the finding that Vietnam was the proper forum for the resolution of the dispute and at the same time allowed the plaintiff recourse in Singapore, if necessary, at the appropriate juncture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I therefore granted a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of proceedings in Vietnam involving the plaintiff, Vu, and any of the defendants in relation to any of the disputes in these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On a related note, the plaintiff had applied for various injunctions. In aid of the proceedings in Vietnam and to protect the interest of the plaintiff in the first defendant, I granted an interim injunction restraining Thao from disposing of her shares in the first defendant until the outcome of proceedings in Vietnam. As explained by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Multi-Code Electronics Industries (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd and another v Toh Chun Toh Gordon and others </span>[2009] 1 SLR 1000 this was pursuant to the Court’s residual jurisdiction under s 4(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) that would allow the stayed Singapore action to be revived and carried forward if it became necessary (at [79]). That decision is not the subject of any appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Costs, considered in the round for both the stay and injunction applications, were awarded to the Applicants in the sum of $15,000 (exclusive of disbursements). </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jimmy Yim SC, Erroll Ian Joseph, Mahesh Rai and Diedre Grace Morgan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the applicants in SUM 3356/2016;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Ying Ying, Lim Yu Jia and Jolyn Khoo (Kelvin Chia Partnership) for the respondent in SUM 3356/2016.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
