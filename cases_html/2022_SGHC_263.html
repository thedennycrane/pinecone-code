A financing deal, by definition, cannot be a genuine sale and purchase that the autonomy principle in LCs for the facilitation of international trade was intended to protect. [Hin Leong’s] Purchase Transaction was no more than a part of the Simultaneous Sale and Buy-Back Transactions that [Glencore] employed to obtain financing from [UniCredit] to optimize [Glencore’s] working capital by taking advantage of the lower interest rate offered by [UniCredit] in commodity transactional financing (through an LC) as compared to the Glencore group treasury interest rate (and banks’ lending rates on clean lines).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 These submissions by UniCredit contradict what it had (in its lead counsel’s statement) agreed was a point of law not in dispute, based on UniCredit’s own wording: “The motive for a transaction is not in itself determinative of whether it is a sham.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 UniCredit’s argument that the Sale Contract is a sham, is premised on Glencore having initiated the transactions for the purposes of obtaining cheaper working capital (and that is why Glencore described the transactions as a “financing deal”

</div>). Glencore’s <span class="font-italic">motive</span> was indeed “financing”, but UniCredit agreed (and rightly so) that motive is not in itself determinative of whether the transactions were a sham. As Glencore formulated the point on motive (at [27] above): “financing” as a motive does not render the transactions a sham “if there was an intention to create legal relations in connection with genuine cargo”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It adds nothing for UniCredit to say (at [28] above) that “[a] financing deal, by definition, cannot be a genuine sale and purchase”. That is just <span class="font-italic">UniCredit’s</span><span class="font-italic"> own definition</span> of what a genuine sale and purchase is – UniCredit’s argument is merely an <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> of the conclusion it wishes to reach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 A <span class="font-italic">genuine</span> sale and purchase is one that is <span class="font-italic">not a sham</span>. A “financing” transaction might or might not be a sham – that depends on whether all parties to the transaction (here, Glencore and Hin Leong) had a common subjective intention that the transaction documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating. In respect of the Sale Contract, those legal rights and obligations would include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Glencore’s obligation to transfer title to the goods to Hin Leong (and Hin Leong’s corresponding right to such transfer of title); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hin Leong’s obligation to pay for the goods (and Glencore’s corresponding right to such payment).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Sale Contract would not be a sham unless there is evidence of a common intention between Glencore and Hin Leong that the <span class="font-italic">purported</span> rights and obligations under the Sale Contract are <span class="font-italic">not real</span> rights and obligations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Glencore and Hin Leong shared a common intention that the purported rights and obligations under the Sale Contract were not to be real rights and obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 UniCredit has not proven, on the evidence, that Glencore and Hin Leong had such a common intention. On the contrary, it appears that the rights and obligations under the Sale Contract were real, and indeed the obligations of title transfer and payment were performed: Glencore transferred title to the goods to Hin Leong, and Hin Leong paid for the goods (by getting UniCredit to issue an LC pursuant to which UniCredit paid Glencore).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Hin Leong could have resold the goods in various ways. Here, it was a <span class="font-italic">simultaneous</span> resale of the goods back to the <span class="font-italic">seller</span>, Glencore. However, Hin Leong could also have:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) sold the goods to a <span class="font-italic">third party</span> (simultaneously or otherwise); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) sold the goods back to Glencore, but at <span class="font-italic">some later point</span> rather than simultaneously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In scenarios (a) and (b) above, the Sale Contract would not be a sham. Hin Leong’s decision to sell the goods to a third party would not involve any common intention between Hin Leong and Glencore relating to the Sale Contract. Nor would any subsequent agreement between Hin Leong and Glencore (for Glencore to buy back the goods) retrospectively make the Sale Contract a sham, if it was not a sham at the time of contracting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 UniCredit’s argument thus reduces to the following: because Hin Leong and Glencore agreed on a <span class="font-italic">simultaneous</span> buyback of the goods by <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span>, the Sale Contract was a sham. Even so, a simultaneous sale-and-buyback arrangement may involve a genuine sale, and a genuine buyback.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Thai Chee Ken and others (Liquidators of Pan-Electric Industries Ltd) v Banque Paribas</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 280 (HC) at [21], [24] and [26]; [1993] 1 SLR(R) 871 (CA) at [9], [12] and [36], the High Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, there was a genuine sale and buyback of shares between Pan Electric (“Pan-El”) and Banque Paribas (“BP”) to raise financing for the former. A key fact was that Pan-El had given negative pledge covenants to other banks that a secured loan would have offended against, making BP’s alternative proposal of a loan on the mortgage of the shares untenable. Parties thus explored and entered into a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> sale and buyback of the shares to avoid affecting the bank’s credit or security position; the transactions were not a lending on security disguised as a sale and buyback.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The <span class="font-italic">structure</span> of the transactions in the present case as a simultaneous sale-and-buyback is thus not determinative of whether the Sale Contract was a sham (as UniCredit contended it was).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 UniCredit argues that Glencore did not intend title in the goods to pass to Hin Leong under the Sale Contract, for Glencore “did not even care to check that contractually, [it] did in fact have title to the Goods that could be passed on [Hin Leong] on 2 December 2019 at 0001 as required under the [Sale Contract].”

Given the confirmation email of 27 November 2019, the fact that Glencore’s Mr Pereira did not delve into the contractual terms does not advance UniCredit’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Far from showing that the transfer of title from Glencore to Hin Leong under the Sale Contract was a sham, the GENUK-Glencore correspondence shows the contrary: the confirmation email of 27 November 2019 shows that Glencore genuinely wanted to have title in time to transfer title to Hin Leong. This is not a case where Glencore had not even purchased the goods for which it was purportedly passing title to Hin Leong, or where Glencore had only agreed to get title from GENUK after the Glencore-Hin Leong transactions had purportedly been performed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 What UniCredit is left with to demonstrate a common intention between Hin Leong and Glencore are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Glencore did not deliver the goods to Hin Leong; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Glencore did not deliver the BLs to Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As far as delivery of the goods is concerned, whether Hin Leong itself wished to take delivery would depend on whether Hin Leong resold the goods (whether to a third party, or back to Glencore). If Hin Leong resold the goods, it might no longer require delivery of the goods to itself; instead, it might want the goods delivered directly to its sub-buyer. This does not make any obligation of delivery in the Sale Contract a sham obligation. Indeed, goods may be resold (possibly more than once) with physical delivery only going to the ultimate buyer, as the English Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain Company Incorporated v HMF Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd and another</span> [1966] 1 QB 650 (“<span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span>”): see [49]–[56] below.

Southernpec failed in that regard (at [111]–[114]): on the evidence, there was no basis to conclude that Goodwood knew or intended the contracts to be shams (at [111]); Goodwood did not know about the whole circle, in particular it did not know about UA/Taigu (at [112]); but even if Goodwood knew that its contracts with SPPL were part of circular chains of trading transactions, there remained insufficient evidence to indicate that Goodwood knew that the fuel oil purportedly transacted was in fact non-existent and that therefore the circular chain of trading transactions was a sham (at [113]); by the whole of its conduct, Goodwood demonstrated that it consistently treated its contracts with SPPL as genuine (at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Southernpec’s appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which was not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong, in particular, that the transactions were not sham ones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Another local case in which circular transactions were not found to be a sham is <span class="font-italic">Crédit</span><span class="font-italic"> Agricole Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Singapore Branch v PPT Energy Trading Co Ltd and another suit</span> [2022] SGHC(I) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Crédit Agricole</span>”). There, a cargo of crude oil was sold by Zenrock to Shandong, Shandong to PPT, and PPT to Zenrock. Zenrock had procured an LC in favour of PPT. The LC issuing bank sought a declaration that PPT was not entitled to payment under the LC for its fraudulent participation in Zenrock’s round-tripping arrangements. The court found that at least two of PPT’s representatives were aware of the round-tripping nature of the transactions (at [113]–[115] and [119]). Nevertheless, the court did not find the circular transactions to be shams (at [120]–[121], [123] and [126]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">120  Despite pleas that the round-tripping transactions were not “<span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>transactions” or were “paper round-tripping transactions” and the<span class="font-italic"> </span>contention that these transactions were “sham” in the sense that they were<span class="font-italic"> </span>not intended to be genuine sale and purchase contracts at the prices set out<span class="font-italic"> </span>therein and for which letters of credit were provided, I could not see that<span class="font-italic"> </span>this was sustainable. <span class="font-italic">For a transaction to be “sham”, it is </span><span class="font-italic">necessary for all the parties to that transaction who have a common subjective intention that the transaction documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations which they give the appearance of creating</span> (<span class="font-italic">Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1967] 2 QB 786 at 802). <span class="font-italic">The motive for a</span><span class="font-italic"> transaction is not in itself determinative of whether it is a sham or not</span>.

Payment of the price was to be made by letter of credit against the provision of the seller’s commercial invoice and original bills of lading and other usual shipping documents, in accordance with TOTSA’s “General Terms and Conditions for F.O.B.

In <span class="font-italic">BWG</span>, X sold cargo to the appellant, the appellant sold the cargo to the respondent, and the respondent sold the cargo back to X. The Court of Appeal agreed with the respondent that this was in fact a disguised loan arrangement (with the appellant injecting funds to kick-start the process for a substantial profit), rather than a series of genuine sale and purchase transactions. The transactions in <span class="font-italic">BWG</span> had the following questionable features (as noted in <span class="font-italic">Goodwood</span> at [107]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the appellant could not explain why it was willing to sell a cargo worth more than US$30m to the respondent without any security and without any history of trading between the parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the only indication of the purported delivery of cargo was an email “update” from the master, which furthermore stated that the discharging of the crude oil had been completed without mentioning the cargo purportedly transacted, or the parties to the transaction; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the notice of readiness tendered was not addressed to the appellant or the respondent, but to two other entities whose involvement was not explained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 There are no such questionable features in the present case.

There, 700,000 shares in Chenab were purportedly issued to Koon Seng as “fully paid”, to raise Chenab’s share capital and thus qualify it for a tender with the Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”). In fact, Koon Seng paid nothing for the shares. The accounting documents reflected a loan from Chenab to a director, to pay for the shares; but Koon Seng did not have a director on the board of Chenab, and such financial assistance would moreover have <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>been a breach of s 76 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) carrying penal liabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Chenab’s counsel said that Koon Seng had “admitted that they are not in a real sense, shareholders of the company because the Plaintiffs are only entitled to 47% share of the profits of the PSA contract … and not any other contracts or profits of the company”; and Koon Seng’s counsel in effect confirmed this, saying that Koon Seng did not buy the shares with cash because it was not interested in the other contracts of Chenab, rather, Koon Seng’s interest was limited to the PSA contract (at [61]). Further, Raj (a majority shareholder and director of Chenab) admitted that Chenab had hoodwinked PSA into thinking that Chenab had $1.5m in paid-up capital, so as to qualify for a tender (at [66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 All these features of <span class="font-italic">Koon Seng</span> are absent from the present case.

This is not an exception to the rule that an actionable misrepresentation must be a statement of fact. That is because, in truth, it is not the broken promise which is the actionable misrepresentation. <span class="font-italic">The actionable misrepresentation is the implicit representation which accompanies every promise: that the promisor genuinely intends to honour his promise.</span> If the promisor has no such intent, the promise is made fraudulently.

All that that means is that this claim cannot succeed simply by the plaintiff showing that the LCA Group has broken its promise. The plaintiff can nevertheless succeed by proving fraud, ie that the LCA Group represented to the plaintiff that it would pay him ‘2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II’ with <span class="font-italic">no intention of keeping the promise</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 UniCredit also cites the commentary in <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 23rd Ed, 2020)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span>”) at [17-11]–[17-12]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] statement as to the future will <span class="font-italic">often</span> imply a statement as to present intention; as Lord Herschell put it, ‘that which is in form a promise <span class="font-italic">may</span> be in another aspect a representation’. Thus a promisor <span class="font-italic">generally</span> represents by implication that he has at the moment of making the promise the intention of fulfilling the obligations that he is undertaking; and if it can be shown that no such intention existed in his mind at that moment, he is guilty of a misrepresentation. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I make two points before stating my conclusion on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 <span class="font-underline">First</span>, there are various types of promises. There are contractual promises, and non-contractual promises. Some non-contractual promises are intended to be acted upon – such as a promise made to induce the promisee to enter into a contract (which was the contention in <span class="font-italic">Uday Mehra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>– see [81] of the judgment). Other non-contractual promises might not be intended to have any legal effect – when parting acquaintances promise to “keep in touch”, they generally do not expect those pleasantries to be grounds for a claim in fraud. Whether there is an implied representation that the promisor intends to do what he promised, will depend on the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 My analysis pertains to contractual promises, like that in this case: that Glencore would locate and surrender the BLs to Hin Leong. A contractual promise is an obligation which the promisor must fulfil, or face the consequences of breach of contract. However, the promisor’s fulfilment of that contractual obligation might not be required in various circumstances, because of supervening illegality, frustration, novation, variation, waiver, and so on. If, as <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> suggests (at [93] above), a promisor generally represents by implication that he intends to fulfil the obligations that he is undertaking, that intention does not go beyond the subsistence of the obligations in question. An implied representation that the promisor intends to fulfil his obligations simply means that he intends to do what he had promised, <span class="font-italic">if circumstances require it</span>. He does not promise to do what he is no longer obliged to, and he does not impliedly represent that he intends to do that either.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I thus consider that <span class="font-italic">if</span> any representation ought to be implied from a contractual promise, it is not that the promisor intends to do what was promised <span class="font-italic">in all circumstances</span>, but that the promisor intends to fulfil his obligation <span class="font-italic">if circumstances require it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span> (discussed at [49]–[56] above) is instructive in this context as well. Sellers LJ said that there may be many cases where the parties do not expect to complete the transaction but instead to trade on differences; Danckwerts LJ said, “normally it was not expected that any delivery of documents would take place until the final export sale”; Diplock LJ said, “it was contemplated by all parties to all four contracts that if all went well those who knew themselves to be intermediate parties, that is, both buyers and sellers, would not insist upon handling the shipping documents but differences in price would be settled in account. The actual property in the goods would never pass to them and the contracts would not be performed according to their terms.” (See also <span class="font-italic">Crédit</span><span class="font-italic"> Agricole</span> at [126], cited at [66] above.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In a case like <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span>, it would not be appropriate to imply a representation that the parties intended to deliver documents or pass property in the goods to intermediate parties in the chain <span class="font-italic">in all circumstances</span>. That is not what they intended. This does not however mean that there was no “obligation to fulfil the contract according to its tenor <span class="font-italic">if circumstances require it</span>” [emphasis added] (as Sellers LJ put it), and on a parity of reasoning, the parties could still have intended to do what was contractually promised <span class="font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">circumstances require it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 <span class="font-underline">Second</span>, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Uday Mehra</span> expressed the proposition in absolute terms, that there is an implicit representation accompanying <span class="font-weight-bold">every</span> promise. <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span>, however, does not put the proposition in absolute terms. <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> says a statement as to present intention “will often” be implied, and that a promisor “generally” represents by implication that he intends to fulfil the obligations undertaken; Lord Herschell is quoted saying that a promise “may” be in another aspect a representation. This recognises that a promise might carry with it an implied representation, or it might not – it will depend on the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Just as a term cannot be implied into a contract if it goes against the actual intentions of the parties (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 at [95]), a representation as to intention cannot be implied from a contractual promise if it goes against the actual intentions of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Whether a representation should be implied from a contractual promise (and if so, what representation) must depend on the circumstances. Diplock LJ held that “the contemplation or expectation or intention … of the parties or either of them as to the way in which it will be performed or left unperformed” does not affect their legal rights and obligations. In a similar vein, what the parties contemplated, expected, or intended, will inform what representations (if any) as to their intentions should be implied from the contractual promises they made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It has been observed that if a promisee “sues upon what is in truth a promise, he must show that this promise forms part of a valid contract.”: Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">Law of Contract (Second Singapore and Malaysian Edition)</span> (Butterworths Asia, 1998), cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng</span> at [21]. Where the promise is part of a valid contract, that contract would govern the parties’ rights and obligations in relation to that contractual promise. That promise may be fulfilled, it may be breached, or the obligation to perform may be discharged or waived. To overlay the contractual framework with implied representations as to intention (which may afford a claim for fraud) has implications (for want of a better word).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The promisee might recover in fraudulent misrepresentation what he might not have in contract – for instance, because of the expiry of a time-bar for contractual claims, contractual defences, or the contractual measure of damages. Adding a potential fraud claim to a contractual framework would not be appropriate where the parties had dealt with each other based on the contract between them, and not based on their respective intentions as to whether to perform that contract. Indeed, they may have carefully prescribed the consequences of potential breaches of contract, not expecting a fraud claim to also subsist alongside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As between Glencore and Hin Leong, I would not imply any representation that Glencore intended to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> all circumstances</span> – that would go against what the parties contemplated, expected, or intended to happen (borrowing the phrase of Diplock LJ’s from <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 683–684). At most, what might be implied – as between Glencore and Hin Leong – is a representation that Glencore intended to fulfil its contractual obligation to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong <span class="font-italic">if</span><span class="font-italic"> circumstances required it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the present case, Hin Leong sold the goods back to Glencore based on a simultaneous transfer of title from Glencore to Hin Leong, and back to Glencore. Glencore assumed a contractual obligation to give the BLs to Hin Leong, but Hin Leong assumed a corresponding obligation to give the BLs back to Glencore. With the sale-and-buyback arrangement, Hin Leong and Glencore did not expect Glencore to have to give Hin Leong the BLs, only for Hin Leong to give them back to Glencore. Hin Leong never asked Glencore for the BLs. Did the circumstances require that Glencore give the BLs to Hin Leong? No.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Should a representation of intention be implied as between seller (beneficiary) and issuing bank?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 UniCredit is one step away from the Sale Contract between Glencore and Hin Leong. What representation (if any) might be implied as between Glencore and Hin Leong would depend on the context between them, but that was a context that UniCredit was not party or privy to. Indeed, it is well-settled that an issuing bank like UniCredit deals in <span class="font-italic">documents</span>, and not the underlying contract between Glencore and Hin Leong, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Sale Contract. That is enshrined in Articles 4a and 5 of UCP 600 which applies to the LC:

Goods were pre-sold if Hin Leong had sold them, otherwise they were unsold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 For pre-sold goods, the Specific Conditions stipulated in relation to repayment, that “[w]here the Commodities are sold on open account the off-taker is to be acceptable to the Bank and payment is to be made directly to the Borrower’s account held with the Bank”. If, however, Hin Leong’s sale of the goods was not on an open account basis, but against an export letter of credit, there was no stipulation that the off-taker (Hin Leong’s sub-buyer, here Glencore) had to be acceptable to UniCredit; what was stipulated instead, was that the export letter of credit was to be acceptable to UniCredit. In the present case, Glencore financed the Buyback Contract by an LC from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (“BBVA”), and so if Hin Leong had told UniCredit that the goods were pre-sold (to Glencore), there was no necessity for Glencore to be an acceptable off-taker in the eyes of UniCredit; instead, the BBVA LC would have to be acceptable to UniCredit.

The collateral was: “[f]ull set of bills of lading issued or endorsed to the order of the Bank or in negotiable form or other title documentation acceptable to the Bank.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 If the goods were unsold while Hin Leong was applying for the LC, but were then sold by Hin Leong after the LC was issued, the Specific Conditions did not require Hin Leong to obtain UniCredit’s consent to that sale. Instead: UniCredit would look to the BLs as collateral; with the LC to be refinanced by an import loan or repaid by other means as agreed by and acceptable to UniCredit. In the present case, UniCredit expected Hin Leong to make repayment from the proceeds of sale of the goods (see [167] below). The problem for UniCredit was that Hin Leong kept telling UniCredit that the goods remained unsold. As I noted above (at [10]), while applying for the LC, Hin Leong represented to UniCredit that the goods were unsold, when it had already entered into the Buyback Contract and so the goods were in fact pre-sold. As late as 28 February 2020, and into early March 2020, Hin Leong still maintained that the goods were unsold, when queried by UniCredit (see [17] above, and [167] below). Hin Leong misrepresented the position to UniCredit, but it does not follow that Glencore thereby did so too.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Because of Hin Leong’s misrepresentation whilst applying for the LC, I accept that UniCredit <span class="font-italic">issued</span> the LC believing that the goods were unsold <span class="font-italic">at that point in time</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 However, this was only UniCredit’s belief as to the state of the goods at the time of the LC’s <span class="font-italic">issuance</span>. Even if the goods were truly unsold (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there was just the Sale Contract, and no Buyback Contract) when the LC was issued, Hin Leong might still have sold the goods thereafter, between the time the LC was issued on 29 November 2019 and the time Glencore sought payment on 2 December 2019. Thus, where UniCredit <span class="font-italic">issued</span> an LC for unsold goods, UniCredit would know that before <span class="font-italic">payment</span> was sought under the LC, those goods may well have been sold. Indeed, after issuing the LC on 29 November 2019, it was only on 28 February 2020 (the date of expiry of the LC), that UniCredit asked Hin Leong whether the goods had been sold (see [17] above). That query itself shows that UniCredit knew it was possible that Hin Leong had sold the goods in the interim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Accordingly, I do not accept that UniCredit still believed that the goods remained unsold up to the time Glencore sought payment on 2 December 2019; UniCredit would have known that Hin Leong might have sold the goods. As between UniCredit and Glencore, it is the time of payment and not the time of issuance that matters: UniCredit attributes the expanded second representation to Glencore’s invoice, which it presented to obtain payment, <span class="font-italic">after</span> the LC had been issued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 If, prior to Glencore seeking payment on 2 December 2019, UniCredit did believe that the goods remained unsold, that would be based on what Hin Leong had said (coupled with UniCredit itself thinking that Hin Leong had not sold the goods in the interim) – it would not be based on any representation by Glencore, for the only representations UniCredit attributes to Glencore are in relation to Glencore’s presentation of its commercial invoice and the LOI on 2 December 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 To elaborate, before Glencore thus entered the picture:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Hin Leong might have misrepresented to UniCredit (while applying for the LC) that the goods were unsold – this is what happened; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hin Leong might have told UniCredit the truth that the goods were pre-sold, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Hin Leong might have told UniCredit about the Buyback Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In scenario (b) above, if Glencore proceeded to present its commercial invoice and LOI to UniCredit as it did, UniCredit would not have viewed that as a representation by Glencore that there was no Buyback Contract. UniCredit would have been told by Hin Leong that there was a Buyback Contract, and it would not consider that Glencore was contradicting that, just because Glencore did not mention the Buyback Contract. Indeed, UniCredit never expected <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span> to inform it as to whether <span class="font-italic">Hin Leong</span> had sold the goods: if UniCredit were expecting to hear about that from anyone, it was Hin Leong, not Glencore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Scenario (a) above does not change the nature of what Glencore represented to UniCredit. Whether or not Hin Leong misrepresented to UniCredit that the goods were unsold, Glencore would not have acted any differently. Glencore had no reason to believe that Hin Leong would lie to its bank, UniCredit. In any event, Glencore was entitled to regard the communications between Hin Leong and UniCredit as a matter between the two of them, it was not something that Glencore had to be concerned with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Glencore simply presented documents as stipulated in the LC, to obtain payment. Glencore thereby represented to UniCredit that it had sold the goods to Hin Leong on the terms of the Sale Contract (which was true), and that it had agreed to locate and surrender the BLs to Hin Leong (which was also true).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 UniCredit’s half-truth case seeks to fault Glencore for not doing more; for not telling UniCredit what it knew of Hin Leong’s sale of the goods. But Glencore was under no obligation to do so: the LC did not require Glencore to do so; and Glencore was not otherwise under an obligation to do so. If the complaint shifts from misrepresentation to non-disclosure, the non-disclosure case fails. Given that UniCredit was only expecting to hear from Glencore about the Sale Contract (and not about Hin Leong’s subsequent dealings with the goods), UniCredit would not have viewed Glencore’s LOI and invoice as saying anything about whether Hin Leong had sold the goods (back to Glencore, or to another party).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Whether Glencore told a half-truth</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 What Glencore said about the Sale Contract was not false by reason of Glencore not also telling UniCredit that Hin Leong had sold the goods. A “half-truth” is a “partial and fragmentary statement of fact” where “the withholding of that which is not stated makes that which is stated absolutely false”: <span class="font-italic">Aldabe Fermin v Standard Chartered Bank</span> [2010] 3 SLR 722 at [125], citing <span class="font-italic">Peek v Gurney</span> (1873) LR 6 HL 377 at 403. What amounts to a half-truth is a “highly fact-sensitive” inquiry: <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [17-07]. Here, the LC required Glencore to provide information and documents about the Sale Contract, and Glencore duly did so, truthfully. Not mentioning the Buyback Contract did not make any aspect of what Glencore said about the Sale Contract false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As articulated in UniCredit’s closing submissions, Glencore would be a fraudster if it knew of <span class="font-italic">any</span> sale of the goods by Hin Leong, and did not tell that to UniCredit. UniCredit’s argument was that by only telling UniCredit about the Sale Contract, Glencore was representing (falsely) that Hin Leong had not sold the goods. This would cover various scenarios:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a <span class="font-italic">simultaneous</span> buyback of the goods by <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span> (as with the Buyback Contract);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> buyback of the goods by Glencore;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a sale of the goods by Hin Leong to the original seller, GENUK (who had sold the goods to Glencore);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) a sale of the goods by Hin Leong to <span class="font-italic">another </span><span class="font-italic">party</span> (not Glencore or GENUK).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In oral submissions, UniCredit’s counsel narrowed the scope of that argument, seeking to limit it to a buyback of the goods by <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span>, whether simultaneous or subsequent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, scenarios (a) and (b) above.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As explained in oral submissions, UniCredit considered it unobjectionable if, when it presented the LOI, Glencore knew that Hin Leong had already sold the goods to GENUK or to another party, and did not tell UniCredit about this. UniCredit would not regard it as a half-truth for Glencore not to volunteer information about Hin Leong’s sales to others; but UniCredit maintains it was a half-truth for Glencore not to tell UniCredit that <span class="font-italic">Glencore</span> itself had bought back the goods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 It is noteworthy that UniCredit did not consider it objectionable for Glencore not to mention a sale by Hin Leong of the goods back to GENUK (although that would complete a circle of transactions, GENUK-Glencore-Hin Leong-GENUK). GENUK was the party holding the BLs, and with the closing of the circle GENUK would contractually be entitled to get the BLs back if it parted with them to Glencore, and Glencore in turn to Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The core complaint UniCredit clings to, is that Glencore represented that it intended to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong, when there was no such intention. Why would that complaint not apply equally to a circular transaction back to GENUK which held the BLs? As Diplock LJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span> at 683–684, those who know that the contracts form a circle (and in this scenario, Glencore would know) “contemplated that if all went well no documents would be delivered at all and no [goods] shipped pursuant to any of the contracts”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the BLs would just stay with GENUK, and so would the goods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Indeed, the sale and buyback arrangement between Glencore and Hin Leong is just another form of circular transaction; the “circle” simply involves only two parties. It does not make sense that UniCredit would consider a GENUK-Glencore-Hin Leong-GENUK circle unobjectionable, but regard a Glencore-Hin Leong-Glencore one as a sham or fictitious, involving fraud being perpetrated by Glencore on UniCredit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Likewise, if Hin Leong had sold the goods to another party (not GENUK or Glencore), Hin Leong might simply have asked that the BLs be delivered directly to that party, bypassing Hin Leong. As Danckwerts LJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain</span> at 679, “normally it was not expected that any delivery of documents would take place until the final export sale [to a party outside the circle]”. Indeed, the goods might even be delivered to the ultimate purchaser without the BLs ever reaching it. The court in <span class="font-italic">Crédit</span><span class="font-italic"> Agricole</span> found at [126] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whilst each party in the chain appears … to have been entitled contractually to the delivery of the original shipping documents from its seller, after presentation of the invoice and letter of indemnity to obtain payment, the evidence showed that, as a matter of commercial practice, traders in legitimate unquestionable chains did not always insist on this and the cargo was delivered to the ultimate receiver without such documents ever reaching it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 By the end of oral submissions, UniCredit did not have a half-truth case anymore.

That too was true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I have accepted the evidence of Glencore’s witnesses (at [57] above) that Glencore did intend to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong if circumstances require it: it might not have <span class="font-italic">expected</span> to have to do so, but if Hin Leong asked for the BLs Glencore would have located and surrendered them. So too, if Glencore came into possession of the BLs it would have surrendered them to Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I cannot infer from the fact of Glencore never giving the BLs to Hin Leong, a lack of a genuine intention on Glencore’s part ever to do so. It was open to Glencore and Hin Leong as the contracting parties to vary the contractual obligations between them. Further, as between Glencore and Hin Leong, Glencore’s obligation to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong was an obligation for Hin Leong’s benefit; as such it was an obligation which Hin Leong could waive performance of. Further, in this regard:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Hin Leong never asked for the BLs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hin Leong had resold the goods back to Glencore and title had been transferred back to Glencore; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if Glencore gave the BLs to Hin Leong, Hin Leong would have had to give them back to Glencore pursuant to the Buyback Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 By their conduct, Hin Leong and Glencore varied their contractual obligations such that Glencore did not have to give the BLs to Hin Leong, and Hin Leong did not have to give them back to Glencore. At the very least, Hin Leong waived its right to get the BLs from Glencore. Fulfilment of Glencore’s obligation to give the BLs to Hin Leong was thus, in the circumstances, not required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In this context, the position taken by Hin Leong’s IJMs is noteworthy. UniCredit’s lawyers had corresponded with the IJMs’ lawyers with a view to getting the IJMs to demand the BLs from Glencore.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As this was a buy-and-sellback transaction, and Hin Leong did sell the HSFO back to Glencore (and the title to the HSFO transferred to Glencore thereon), Hin Leong had a corresponding obligation to redeliver the Glencore Transaction BLs. The IJMs have ascertained that Hin Leong presented a letter of indemnity to Glencore’s bank in respect of the sale of the HSFO wherein Hin Leong agreed to surrender the Glencore Transaction BLs to Glencore. Thus, the IJMs are not in a position to procure Hin Leong to make a demand for the Glencore Transaction BLs from Glencore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Hin Leong’s IJMs correctly recognised that while Glencore had a contractual obligation to deliver the BLs to Hin Leong, Hin Leong had a corresponding obligation to redeliver them back to Glencore. Indeed, if Hin Leong were to obtain the BLs and give them to UniCredit, Hin Leong would run the risk of breaching its obligation to give the BLs back to Glencore (in the event of UniCredit refusing to part with the BLs). In the event, Hin Leong never sought to obtain the BLs from Glencore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 As the court in <span class="font-italic">Uday Mehra</span> recognised (see [92] above), a plaintiff claiming in fraudulent misrepresentation cannot succeed simply by showing that a promise has been broken; he must prove that when the promise was made, there was no intention to honour it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 That point is illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Trafigura Beheer BV v Kookmin Bank Co</span> [2005] EWHC 2350 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Trafigura</span>”). The seller (Trafigura) too had presented an LOI to obtain payment on an LC (issued by Kookmin). In the LOI issued to the buyer (Huron), Trafigura stated that it was then unable to provide the original BLs, but that it agreed to “make all reasonable efforts to locate and surrender … as soon as possible, the full set of 3 [BLs] (or 2/3 [BLs] and Masters receipt for 1/3 of the original [BLs])”. When it presented the LOI, Trafigura did not have compliant BLs to present for payment, it had non-compliant ones. Subsequently Trafigura obtained compliant BLs, but it gave Kookmin 2 BLs and a Masters receipt in place of the third BL. Kookmin complained about not receiving all 3 original BLs – in parallel proceedings before the South Korean courts, it asserted that Trafigura acted fraudulently as it “received payment for the shipment with no intention to forward the remaining original bill of lading” (at [13(ii)]). Before the English court, Trafigura sought a declaration that it “did not undertake or represent that it would (or intended to) provide all the Bills of Lading to the Defendant” (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The court noted that the basis of Kookmin’s allegation “appear[ed] to rest at the point when payment was obtained by Trafigura with the intention of not sending the original Bills of Lading to Kookmin rather than on the subsequent failure to send them, and on a fraudulent intention at the time of obtaining such payment” (at [14]). The court found that there was no viable claim against Trafigura for fraudulent misrepresentation. Under the LC, Trafigura was entitled to present the LOI to obtain payment when conforming BLs were unavailable (at [25]). As such, in presenting the LOI, it was not thereby representing that it had no BLs whatsoever – it could be that it did not have 3 sets of conforming BLs (as was the case). The fact that Trafigura did not eventually provide 3 BLs, but only 2 plus a Masters receipt in place of the third, did not support a conclusion that when Trafigura presented the LOI, it had no genuine intention to provide 3 BLs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I have similarly found that Glencore intended to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong <span class="font-italic">if c</span><span class="font-italic">ircumstances required it. </span>Accordingly, I reject what UniCredit alleged in para 47 of the SOC, that “[Glencore] never had the intention to and/or did not have the intention at the material time to and/or knew that it would never surrender the original Missing Shipping Documents (including the original BLs) to [Hin Leong] as represented in the LOI”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did Glencore act fraudulently?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I do not accept that Glencore acted fraudulently. Having considered the written and oral evidence of Glencore’s representatives, I do not accept that they knowingly or recklessly made false statements to UniCredit. I do not accept that Glencore intended to cheat or defraud UniCredit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I highlight that on 31 May 2018, Glencore’s Mr van Rooyen informed UniCredit’s Mr Patrick Welch by email that Glencore engaged in “sale and buy back” repo financing transactions “for working capital optimisation”.

</div> Glencore did not seek to hide from UniCredit the fact that it engaged in “sale and buy back” transactions. UniCredit seeks to distinguish such repo financing transactions from the Glencore-Hin Leong transactions, on the basis that in repo financing transactions the bank has visibility of both legs of the “sale and buy back”. The point remains, though, that there is nothing inherently wrong about a “sale and buy back” arrangement; UniCredit would know Glencore did not think there was anything wrong with it; and UniCredit would have known from that time, that Glencore did engage in “sale and buy back” transactions. UniCredit would thus not have concluded, when Glencore presented documents to obtain payment under the LC, that Glencore had not bought back the goods from Hin Leong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Further, I do not accept UniCredit’s assertion that Glencore knew or ought to have known that the goods and BLs under the Sale Contract were intended to have been pledged or given as security by Hin Leong to UniCredit.

</div> UniCredit complains about Glencore not giving UniCredit the BLs, but Glencore was under no obligation to do so. Glencore’s obligation was to surrender the BLs <span class="font-italic">to Hin Leong</span>, as stated in the LOI, not to surrender the BLs to <span class="font-italic">UniCredit</span>. Indeed, if Glencore had surrendered the BLs directly to Hin Leong, and Hin Leong did not then give them to UniCredit, UniCredit would be in a similar position to its present predicament: without the BLs, and without a pledge over the BLs. UniCredit says it counted on Glencore giving the BLs to Hin Leong through the banking chain

Hin Leong continued to misrepresent to UniCredit into early March 2020 that the goods remained unsold, when title had already passed back to Glencore (on 2 December 2019) and long after the delivery window under the Sale Contract (18 to 25 December 2019). None of this is Glencore’s fault. In this regard, UniCredit does not seek to rescind the LC because of Hin Leong’s misrepresentations, independent of fault on the part of Glencore (by Glencore entering into a sham transaction, or Glencore making fraudulent misrepresentations to Unicredit).

</div> That too has nothing to do with UniCredit relying on any representations by Glencore. UniCredit paid Glencore because the documents presented for payment complied with the LC. Whether or not there was the Buyback Contract, the documents complied with the LC. I do not believe that UniCredit would have withheld payment from Glencore if, prior to payment, UniCredit had found out about the Buyback Contract. That would have put UniCredit in breach of its payment obligation under the LC, and exposed it to a suit by Glencore to which UniCredit would have no defence (see [107]–[109] above). If, for example, when Glencore presented documents to UniCredit, Glencore had also mentioned the Buyback Contract, and told UniCredit that it expected Hin Leong would not require the BLs (but that if Hin Leong did, Glencore would surrender the BLs to Hin Leong), Glencore would not have falsely represented anything to UniCredit. If UniCredit then refused to pay Glencore, that would have nothing to do with UniCredit relying on any false representations by Glencore.

Glencore made no representation that the <span class="font-italic">goods</span> would be delivered to UniCredit, indirectly or directly; indeed, UniCredit was not looking to take delivery of the goods. As between Hin Leong and Glencore, any obligation to deliver the goods could be modified – in the event, Hin Leong sold the goods back to Glencore, and Hin Leong did not seek to take physical delivery of the goods and redeliver them to Glencore. As for the BLs, Glencore never represented that it would give the BLs indirectly or directly to UniCredit. All that Glencore represented to UniCredit was that it had agreed to surrender the BLs to Hin Leong. As between Hin Leong and Glencore, that obligation could be modified – in the event, Hin Leong never asked for the BLs, and they remained with GENUK.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Glencore made no representation to UniCredit that Hin Leong would not resell the goods.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Whatever grievances UniCredit may have against Hin Leong, it cannot blame UniCredit’s Misapprehension on Glencore. There is nothing unjust in Glencore being paid on the LC – Glencore was legally entitled to that payment, having presented complying documents to UniCredit. Moreover, that payment was for a genuine sale of goods by Glencore to Hin Leong. Glencore transferred title to the goods to Hin Leong in consideration for payment (which it then received from UniCredit under the LC). Glencore then detrimentally changed its position in reliance on that payment, by reimbursing its bank BBVA in the sum of US$37,194,678.42 (for the Buyback Contract), a sum which exceeds the US$36,997,691.57 that UniCredit had paid Glencore.
