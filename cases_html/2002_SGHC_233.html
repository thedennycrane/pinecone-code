        In their statement of claim, the first

plaintiff, Mr Sin Sai Peng ("Patrick"), and his wife, the second plaintiff,

Madam Lee Kim Me, claimed the sum of $271,795 from the defendant, Madam Florence Soh Kim

Lian, who was Patrick’s mistress from 1981 until September 1997. The plaintiffs

contended that the sum claimed was the unpaid balance of the purchase price of No 97C,

Upper Thomson Road, #05-11 Lakeview, Singapore 574329 (the "Lakeview

apartment"), which was transferred by them to Florence in 1994. Florence denied owing

the plaintiffs any money for the purchase of the Lakeview apartment and sought, inter

alia, an order for vacant possession of the said property. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[A] BACKGROUND</font></p></b><u xmlns="">
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        This is a sordid tale of a bitter dispute

involving a man, his loyal and long-suffering wife and his former mistress. For the

ostensible purpose of advancing their respective cases, Patrick and Florence hurled

countless allegations of sexual misconduct and perversion against each other. Both of them

ought to have realised that the lurid details of their alleged sexual activities had

nothing to do with what is essentially a dispute regarding the ownership of property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        In 1981, Patrick, a marine engineer, who was

already married to Madam Lee, began an affair with Florence, who was then a clerk. He was

33 years old whereas she was only 21. In 1989, Patrick brought his mistress to his

matrimonial home at Lakeview to meet his wife without giving the latter any prior notice.

His purpose was, in his own words, to "increase the interaction" between the two

women in his life. When he brought Florence to the Lakeview apartment a second time, his

wife left the matrimonial home for a few days. After this incident, Patrick had to wait

for an opportune moment to ask his wife to meet Florence again.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        In August 1990, Florence gave birth to a baby

boy, A. Patrick, who had always wanted a son, was overjoyed. Florence was then living with

her sister in Jurong and Patrick thought that it would be more convenient for him and

Florence if she, and their son, Jason, had their own home. He arranged for her to buy a

5-room HDB flat in Tampines (the "Tampines flat") for $162,500. He contributed

$61,000 for the flat, which was registered in Florence’s name, and she paid the

balance of the purchase price with money from her CPF account and a housing loan. She paid

the monthly instalments for the loan as well as the conservancy and utility bills.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        In the latter part of 1991, Patrick told his

wife that he and Florence had a son. He expressed his desire to have Florence and Jason

become "an integral part of the family". Madam Lee was hurt and angry but she

agreed to meet Florence and Jason. Apparently, the meeting was a cordial one and Madam Lee

played with Jason for two hours. After that meeting, Patrick often brought Florence and

Jason to the Lakeview apartment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        In early 1992, Patrick told his wife that he

wanted Florence and Jason to live with them in the Lakeview apartment. Madam Lim said that

she agreed with her husband’s plan as she was very fond of Jason. Furthermore, she

accepted that it was troublesome for her husband to commute between Lakeview and Tampines.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        Why Florence, who had her own spacious flat at

Tampines, agreed to move into the Lakeview apartment in early 1992 cannot be fathomed. At

the Lakeview apartment, she had to share a room with her son, Jason, her maid and

Patrick’s aged mother. Florence said that she felt very awkward in the Lakeview

apartment but agreed to live there as she loved Patrick and he was a domineering man. The

Tampines flat was then rented out for $800 per month and Florence accepted Patrick’s

suggestion that she give Madam Lee half the rental as a gesture of goodwill.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The occupants of the Lakeview apartment got on

well enough for a while. In November 1992, Florence gave birth to a girl, B. Patrick,

Madam Lee, Florence and their children had innumerable outings in Singapore and vacations

in Malacca, Genting Highlands, Port Dickson, Kuala Lumpur and Bali. According to Madam

Lee, her relationship with Florence grew warmer with the passing days. Florence called her

"sister" and A called her "mum". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        In 1993, the plaintiffs, who made a profit of

$180,000 on the sale of their other apartment at Thomson Grove Condominium, wanted to

purchase an apartment at Faber Garden (the "Faber apartment"). Florence said

that Patrick suggested that she sell the Tampines flat and buy the Lakeview apartment from

him and his wife in order to help them purchase the Faber apartment. The plaintiffs denied

that they needed funds from the sale of the Tampines flat to help them purchase the Faber

apartment and claimed that they sold the Lakeview apartment at a discounted price of

$380,000 to Florence because of their affection for her, A and B. It is worth noting that

although the plaintiffs said that the Lakeview apartment was then worth around $600,000,

Richard Ellis’ valuation report on 29 November 1993 stated that the apartment was

worth only $450,000 on the open market and added that its forced sale value was merely

$405,000. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        On 5 November 1993, the Tampines flat was sold

for $285,000 and on 23 November 1993, the plaintiffs signed the sale and purchase

agreement for No 6, Angklong Lane, #09-04 Faber Gardens, for $808,000. Soon thereafter, on

6 December 1993, the sale and purchase agreement for the Lakeview apartment was signed by

Patrick, his wife and Florence. As the completion date for the sale of the Tampines flat

was scheduled for February 1994, Patrick moved all the occupants of the Lakeview apartment

to the Tampines flat for about one and a half months so that the Lakeview apartment could

be renovated. After the renovation work was completed, everyone moved back to the Lakeview

apartment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        After receiving the proceeds from the sale of

her Tampines flat, Florence issued a cheque dated 6 April 1994 for $170,000 in favour of

Patrick. Florence also paid Patrick and his wife $50,800 from her CPF account and $58,000

from a POSB loan. Although the total amount paid by Florence for the Lakeview apartment

fell short of the purchase price of $380,000, Patrick and his wife signed a note

confirming that they had received full payment of the purchase price and the legal title

to the Lakeview apartment was transferred to Florence in May 1994. Until the present

dispute arose, Patrick and his wife did not demand from Florence the unpaid balance of the

purchase price. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        By 1995, relations between Patrick and Florence

soured. Patrick alleged that Florence had an affair with a Greek national, George Pililis,

a married man. Florence claimed that she entertained George at Patrick’s request to

improve his business network. After frequent quarrels, Florence and her two children moved

out of the Lakeview apartment in September 1997. She said that she left because of the

plaintiffs’ refusal to vacate the property and Patrick’s intolerable and

unreasonable behaviour towards her. A bitter battle for custody of the two children

ensued. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        After leaving the Lakeview apartment,

Florence’s lawyers demanded that the plaintiffs vacate the said property. In response

to this, the plaintiffs placed a caveat on the Lakeview apartment on 26 September 1997. On

1 April 1999, Florence’s lawyers again demanded that the plaintiffs vacate the

Lakeview apartment. In 1998, Florence started to pay the maintenance fees and sinking fund

levied on the said property. She paid the property tax for the said property with effect

from February 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        On 13 April 1999, Florence commenced an action

in the District Court for, inter alia, vacant possession of the Lakeview apartment and the

removal of the caveat placed by the plaintiffs on the said property. The plaintiffs, who

counterclaimed for, inter alia, the unpaid balance of the purchase price for the Lakeview

apartment, successfully applied for the action to be transferred to the High Court.

However, the action and counterclaim were discontinued on 6 January 2001 on the orders of

the Registrar. The plaintiffs then commenced the present action to recover the unpaid

balance of the purchase price for the Lakeview apartment. Florence counterclaimed for,

inter alia, vacant possession of the said property. In response to the counterclaim, the

plaintiffs asserted that they had a right to continue to reside in the Lakeview apartment

permanently because that was the agreed arrangement when they sold the Lakeview apartment

to Florence.<b> </b></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[B] APPROACH FOR RESOLVING THE

DISPUTE</font></p></b><u xmlns=""><i>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        This case is unusual because the vendors and

the purchaser, who were involved in a love triangle, lived together in the property which

was sold and their living arrangements did not alter for many years after the sale of the

said property. Furthermore, although the property was transferred to the purchaser in

1994, a substantial part of the purchase price has, to date, not been paid to the vendors

and the question of the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price would probably

not have arisen had the purchaser not insisted on having vacant possession of the said

property. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        I have no doubt that when the Lakeview

apartment was transferred to Florence in 1994, no one contemplated that she would fall out

with Patrick and no thought was given to the legal consequences of a break-down of their

relationship on their living arrangements. In<i> Hardwick v Johnson </i>[1978] 2 All ER

935, 938, Lord Denning MR shed some light on the approach to take in dealing with such

circumstances when he said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In most of these cases, the

    question cannot be solved by looking to the intention of the parties because the situation

    which arises is one which they never envisaged and for which they made no provision. So

    many things are undecided, undiscussed, and unprovided for that the task of the courts is

    to fill in the blanks. The court has to look at all the circumstances and spell out the

    legal relationship. The court will pronounce in favour of a tenancy or a licence, a loan

    or a gift, or a trust, according to which of these legal relationships is most fitting in

    the situation which has arisen; and will find that terms of that relationship according to

    what reason and justice require.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        In <i>Pettitt v Pettitt </i>[1970] AC 777, 823,

Lord Diplock also outlined what should be done by the court in a situation such as the

present in the following succinct terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[T]he court imputes to the

    parties a common intention which in fact they never formed and it does so by forming its

    own opinion as to what would have been the common intention of reasonable men as to the

    effect [of the unforeseen event] if it had been present to their minds.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        In the present case, it is unrealistic to

expect the parties to continue to live together at the Lakeview apartment. This was

finally conceded by the plaintiffs, who initially insisted that they had a right to reside

there permanently. What the parties require is a pronouncement on their present rights and

liabilities in relation to the Lakeview apartment. In this context, there can be no doubt

that the common intention of reasonable men, had they known of the changed circumstances

in which the parties found themselves in since September 1997, would, without more, have

been that Florence should have vacant possession of the Lakeview apartment. Such

reasonable men would also have intended that Florence should pay the unpaid balance of the

purchase price if she wants to have vacant possession of the said apartment. In view of

these conclusions, what remains for consideration in relation to the Lakeview apartment

are the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    Are there circumstances

    which might deny Florence the right to have vacant possession of the Lakeview apartment?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)    Did the plaintiffs, as

    alleged by Florence, waive their right to demand the unpaid balance of the purchase price

    of the Lakeview apartment from her? If they did not, what is the amount owed by Florence

    to them?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c)    Are the plaintiffs entitled

    to claim from Florence the cost of renovation work undertaken by them in early 1994 and

    expenses such as property tax and maintenance fees?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d)    Is Florence entitled to

    claim for loss of rental as from September 1997 or for the rental which she had to pay for

    her accommodation after she left the Lakeview apartment?</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[C] THE CLAIM FOR VACANT

POSSESSION</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Florence’s counterclaim for vacant

possession of the Lakeview apartment will, for convenience, be considered first. The

plaintiffs initially contended that Florence is not entitled to vacant possession of the

Lakeview property because it was sold to her on the agreed understanding that they were to

have a right to reside there permanently. However, they failed to prove the existence of

such a family arrangement. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The plaintiffs said that they had intended to

hold the Lakeview apartment as joint tenants with Florence and that their lawyer, Ms

Angeline Jansen, advised them that this was not possible because Florence was using CPF

funds to pay for the apartment. In view of this, the property was transferred to Florence

with "the common intention and expectation to make the Lakeview property our

permanent home". They said that Ms Jansen was aware of the family arrangement.

However, Ms Jansen testified that she did not know about any "family

arrangement" regarding the transfer of the Lakeview apartment to Florence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        The plaintiffs said that the Lakeview property

was transferred to Florence to ensure that Florence’s children, A and B, will be

sufficiently provided for in the event that something untoward happened to their father.

Neither of them were able to explain with any credibility why it was necessary for

Florence and her children to be given a roof over their heads when all of them were

already staying at the Lakeview apartment. In any case, Florence was then the owner of

another property, the Tampines flat. I believe Florence when she said that the Lakeview

property was transferred to her because she had agreed to hand over the proceeds of the

sale of the Tampines flat to the plaintiffs to enable them to purchase the Faber apartment

for themselves. This arrangement suited the plaintiffs as they were able to acquire

another property and earn rental from it without having to move out of the Lakeview

apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        As the trial progressed, Madam Lee became less

sure of her rights under the alleged family arrangement. When cross-examined, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Is it not time for you to pack

    your bags and leave the Lakeview apartment?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. <u><i>If she pays the balance,

    we will go</i></u>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. However, in your affidavit,

    you said that the defendant’s claim for vacant possession is unsustainable. Why?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Because we trusted her. <u><i>I

    am so confused. Since she wants the whole house, she has to pay the balance</i></u>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        By the end of the trial, the plaintiffs had

become more realistic about their rights. In paragraph 131 of his written submissions at

the close of the trial, the plaintiffs’ counsel, Mr Suhaimi bin Lazim<i>,</i>

oultined his clients’ final position as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Plaintiffs acknowledge that

        As the question of relying on the alleged

family arrangement no longer arises, what must next be addressed is the plaintiffs’

contention that they need not vacate the Lakeview apartment until the purchase price has

been fully paid by Florence because they had a vendor’s lien on the property.

Florence’s counsel, Mr Alphonso Ang, retorted that the lien claimed by the plaintiffs

did not entitle them to retain possession of the Lakeview apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        If one looks squarely at the character of the

present transaction, it would be quite inappropriate to talk about a vendor’s lien.

Apart from the fact that the sale of the Lakeview apartment was completed long ago in

1994, such a lien must have been furthest from the plaintiffs’ mind when the Lakeview

apartment was transferred to Florence. After all, they even signed an acknowledgement that

they had been paid the entire purchase price even though they knew that this was not the

real position. In any case, even if the plaintiffs had such a lien, they must be taken to

have abandoned it long ago. I thus order that Florence be given vacant possession of the

Lakeview apartment. <b> </b></font></p>

    PURCHASE PRICE</font></p>
</blockquote></blockquote></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        The plaintiffs’ claim for the unpaid

balance of the purchase price of the Lakeview apartment will next be considered.

Admittedly, they signed an acknowledgement that they had received from Florence the entire

consideration for the transfer of the property to her. However, it is not disputed that

Florence did not pay $380,000 for the Lakeview apartment. If Lord Diplock’s approach

in <i>Pettitt v Pettitt </i>is followed, the inescapable conclusion must, without more, be

that Florence would have to pay the unpaid balance of the purchase price if she is to have

vacant possession of the Lakeview apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        Florence contended that the question of payment

of the unpaid balance of the purchase price does not arise because such payment had been

waived by the plaintiffs. She admitted that neither Patrick nor his wife told her that the

unpaid balance of the purchase price would never be collected from her. When

cross-examined, she said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Is it true that Patrick and

    his wife never told you that the payment of the balance of the purchase price had been

    waived?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. What conduct of theirs gave

    you the impression that the payment of the balance of the purchase price had been waived?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. They did not ask me to pay. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        In truth, the position of the unpaid balance of

the purchase price of the Lakeview apartment was left in limbo because of the nature of

the parties’ relationship and their living arrangements at the relevant time. Patrick

and his wife may have been content not to demand the unpaid balance of the purchase price

so long as everyone continued to live in harmony at the Lakeview apartment. However, the

position needed re-examination once Florence demanded that they vacate the premises. I

thus hold that the plaintiffs are entitled to the unpaid balance of the purchase price of

the Lakeview apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        As for how much is owed by Florence, the

plaintiffs pleaded that she has paid them only $108,800. After taking into account the

conveyancing fees, the plaintiffs contended that Florence still owed them the sum of

$271,795 for the Lakeview apartment. Florence rightly asserted that the $170,000 paid by

her into the DBS Bank account of Patrick and Florence after the completion of the sale of

her Tampines flat in 1994 must be taken into account when determining the amount she has

already paid for the Lakeview apartment. Initially, the plaintiffs unashamedly denied that

the $170,000 was a part payment of the purchase price of the Lakeview apartment. Patrick

claimed that the $170,000 was Florence’s gift to him. Given the timing of the three

transactions handled by Patrick, namely the sale of the Tampines flat by Florence in

November 1993, the purchase of the Faber apartment by the plaintiffs in November 1993 and

the sale of the Lakeview apartment to Florence in December 1993, as well as the

circumstances of the case, I hold that the sum of $170,000 paid into the plaintiffs’

account by Florence was in respect of the purchase of the Lakeview apartment. As such, the

plaintiffs are, without more, only entitled to claim $101,795 from Florence as far as the

unpaid balance of the purchase price of the Lakeview apartment is concerned.<b> </b></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[E] THE PLAINTIFFS’ OTHER

CLAIMS</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        During the trial, the plaintiff sought to

deduct $61,000 from the $170,000 paid by Florence to them on the ground that the $61,000

was a repayment to Patrick of his contribution for the purchase price of the Tampines

apartment. They also sought to recover from Florence the cost of renovating the Lakeview

apartment in early 1994 as well as other expenses such as maintenance fees and property

tax. These claims fail for a number of reasons. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        To begin with, the plaintiffs’ claim in

this action is for the sum of $271,795, which is, according to them, the unpaid balance of

the purchase price of the Lakeview property. There is no indication in the pleadings that

$61,000 was being claimed as the refund of a contribution by Patrick towards the purchase

price of the Tampines flat. Indeed, the plaintiffs’ position is that the payment by

Florence of the $170,000 "is wholly separate and <i>unconnected with the present

claim</i>" by them (see paragraph 7 of the plaintiffs’ reply and defence to

Florence’s counterclaim). As for the plaintiffs’ claim in relation to renovation

work, the plaintiffs did point out in their defence to Florence’s counterclaim for

vacant possession that they renovated the apartment in 1994 in reliance on an alleged

arrangement which entitled them to reside in the Lakeview apartment permanently. However,

this assertion was made to show the existence of the alleged family arrangement. It does

not follow that a claim for the cost of renovation work had been made. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        Although the plaintiffs’ claims in

relation to the $61,000 and the renovation cost and other expenses have not been pleaded,

I might add, for the sake of completeness, that even if these claims had been pleaded,

they would not have been allowed for the reasons stated below. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The claim for $61,000</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        Florence claimed that the $61,000 paid by

Patrick for the Tampines flat was a gift to her. She has the burden of proving her

assertion. No presumption of advancement arises as Florence is Patrick’s mistress and

not his wife. After considering the evidence and listening to the witnesses, I hold that

on a balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that the $61,000 was a gift from

Patrick to Florence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        When cross-examined, Patrick explained why he

decided that Florence, who was then staying with her sister, and his son, A, should have a

home of their own in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. You decided that it was time

    for the defendant and A to have a house to live in?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. I have to be a responsible

    father to my son and to provide a roof for his mother. <u><i>I considered the defendant

    more or less as my wife</i></u>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        Patrick next testified that if he had the

money, he would have presented the flat as an "outright gift" to the person he

considered "more or less" as his wife. When cross-examined, he said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Q. Were you prepared, as a

    Chinese businessman, to buy a house outright for her?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A. <u><i>If I were a rich man, I

    would</i></u> but I did not have money to buy a house outright for her and my son. I

    needed assistance.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(Emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        If Patrick was, in his own words, prepared to

give Florence an "outright gift" of a house had he been a rich man, it may be

assumed that as he could not afford to pay the entire amount required for the purchase of

the Tampines flat, he gave her part of the money needed to purchase this flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.

        It is also pertinent to note that in the

re-amended reply and defence to the counterclaim, it was alleged that Florence gave

Patrick the $170,000 from the proceeds of the sale of the Tampines flat "<i>in

appreciation</i>" of the initial capital contribution by him for the purchase of the

flat. It was thus not asserted by the plaintiffs that Florence refunded Patrick $61,000

and gave him $109,000. The plaintiffs cannot blow hot and cold. After taking into account

all the circumstances of the case, including the fact that Patrick regarded Florence

"more or less" as his wife and wanted to be a responsible father to A by

providing a roof for him and his mother, I hold that the $61,000 paid by Patrick for the

Tampines flat was a gift to Florence. As such, the amount owed by Florence to the

plaintiffs for the Lakeview apartment is only $101,795. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The plaintiffs’ claim for

the cost of renovations and other expenses</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.

        During the trial, the plaintiffs claimed from

Florence the $80,000 spent on renovating the Lakeview apartment in early 1994 as well as a

number of other specified expenses. Apart from the fact that this claim was not pleaded,

it is unreasonable and ludicrous. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.

        In <i>Dodsworth v Dodsworth</i> [1973] 228 EG

1115, the plaintiff, an old lady who lived alone in a bungalow, invited her younger

brother and his wife, the two defendants, to live with her in her bungalow. The defendants

spent more than 700 on improvements to the premises in the expectation that they would

be able to remain there. After the relationship between the parties broke down, the

defendants sought an order protecting their right to occupy the bungalow. Braithwaite J,

who found that the plaintiff had encouraged and induced the defendants to spend money on

improvements to the bungalow, ordered the plaintiff to repay the defendants the amount

expended by them. His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, which varied the

amount due to the defendants to 976. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.

        In another case relied on by the plaintiffs, an

Australian decision, <i>Morris v Morris </i>[1982] 1 NSWLR 61, a widower, the plaintiff,

discussed his living arrangements with the defendants, his son and daughter-in-law, after

his wife passed away. It was agreed that the plaintiff should sell his house, use the

proceeds of the sale to pay for the construction of a second storey extension to the

defendants’ house and stay in the extended house. Subsequently, the plaintiff’s

son left the house after his marriage broke down. The plaintiff also left the house when

his relationship with his daughter-in-law deteriorated. It was held by McLelland J that it

would be unconscionable and inequitable for the defendants to retain the benefit of the

plaintiff’s expenditure on their property free from any obligation of recoupment. He

thus ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to an equitable charge over the

defendants’ property in the sum of $28,000. In coming to his decision, he relied on

the following statement by the Privy Council in <i>Chalmers v Pardoe </i>[1963] 1 WLR 677,

681, 682:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There can be no doubt upon the

    authorities that where an owner of land has invited or <i>expressly encouraged another to

    expend money</i> upon his part of his land <i>upon the face of an assurance or promise</i>

    that that part of the land will be made over to the person so expending his money, a court

    of equity will prima facie require the owner by appropriate conveyance to fulfil his

    obligation….</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.

        In <i>Dodsworth v Dodsworth</i> and <i>Morris v

Morris, </i>the owner of a house invited another party to move into his or her house and

that other party’s expenditure to improve the house was encouraged by the owner. In

the present case, all the parties were living together in the same home and it was not

established that Florence encouraged Patrick or his wife to renovate the Lakeview

apartment in 1994. I believe that Florence had no say in the matter. The unreasonableness

of the plaintiffs’ position becomes even more evident when it is borne in mind that

their claim for the cost of renovations includes money spent on beds, mattresses,

furniture and household appliances, which have been used by them, their children and

Patrick’s mother since early 1994. Surely, these old and used items, if not already

discarded, can be carted away when the plaintiffs vacate the Lakeview apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.

        Admittedly, some value may be attached to tiles

and grilles that were replaced in 1994. However, in the unexpected altered circumstances

that the parties find themselves in after the breakdown of Patrick’s relationship

with Florence, the claim for the cost of renovations, which, in the main, satisfied the

plaintiffs’ own needs, ought to be rejected. </font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The plaintiffs’ claim for

other expenses</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.

        The plaintiffs also asserted that Florence

should reimburse them for the sums paid by them for maintenance fees, sinking fund and

property tax from 1994 until Florence left the Lakeview apartment in September 1997. This

claim, which was not pleaded, is also a ridiculous claim. Surely Patrick, the head of the

household, cannot expect his mistress to maintain him, his wife, his children and his

mother by paying for the maintenance fees and property tax from 1994 onwards when he was

not paying her any rent for occupying the Lakeview apartment. <b> </b></font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">F. DEFENDANT’S COUNTERCLAIM

FOR RENTAL</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.

        I now turn to Florence’s claim for loss of

rental for the Lakeview apartment for the period after November 1997. Her basis for asking

the plaintiffs to move out of the Lakeview apartment in 1997 was that she was entitled to

vacant possession of the property without having to pay the unpaid balance of the purchase

price. This, as has been pointed out, is a fallacious assumption. In the unusual

circumstances of this case, there can be no doubt that until the question of

Florence’s liability to pay the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the Lakeview

apartment has been sorted out, one cannot expect the plaintiffs to give Florence vacant

possession of the said apartment. That being the case, the question of a claim for loss of

rental does not arise. For the same reason, I also hold that Florence is not entitled to

claim the amount paid by her for the premises required by her after she left the Lakeview

apartment in September 1997. No one asked her to leave the said apartment. She conceded

that she left because that was the only way to end her relationship with Patrick. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.

        It is also worth noting that as far as

Florence’s claim for loss of rental of the Lakeview apartment is concerned, no

satisfactory evidence of the alleged loss was tendered. Her witness, a real estate agent,

admitted that he had no knowledge of the rental of apartments in Lakeview at the relevant

time. As such, for more than one reason, this claim by Florence cannot be countenanced. <b> </b></font></p>
<b xmlns="">

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.

        Florence applied for an order that the

plaintiffs remove their caveat on the Lakeview property. As the plaintiffs ought to be

allowed to retain the caveat until the unpaid balance of the purchase price has been paid

to them, Florence’s application is dismissed.</font></p>
