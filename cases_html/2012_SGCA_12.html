        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the judgment of the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”) for Suit No 71 of 2009 in <em>Monetary Authority of Singapore v Lew Chee Fai Kevin</em>
                    [2010] 4 SLR 209 (“the Judgment”). The appellant, Kevin
                    Lew Chee Fai (“Lew”), was found liable for insider trading under
                    s 218 of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the SFA”) and was penalised with a civil penalty under
                    s 232(2) of the SFA. The gist of the case against Lew was that he sold
                    90,000 of his shares in WBL Corporate Private Limited (“WBL”) on
                    4 July 2007 (“the material time”), when he was in possession
                    of non-public price-sensitive information about WBL which he had acquired at an
                    internal executive meeting held on 2 July 2007. We dismissed the appeal and
                    now give the detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By way of general background, the SFA imposes
                    both civil and criminal penalties for the offence of insider trading as defined
                    in s 218 (which applies to “connected persons” as defined in
                    s 218(5)) and s 219 (which applies to all other persons) of the SFA,
                    respectively. Section 218 is the relevant section in this appeal. Under
                    s 221 of the SFA, a defendant may be criminally prosecuted for contravening
                    s 218 (which we will refer to hereafter as “criminal insider
                    trading”). Alternatively, the Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”), the respondent in this appeal, may bring a civil action
                    against the defendant for the same (which we will refer to hereafter as
                    “civil insider trading”). This was the first civil insider trading
                    case to be litigated under the SFA since it was passed in 2001 and the first to
                    be appealed to the Court of Appeal. In previous cases of civil insider trading,
                    MAS had availed itself of its power under s 232(5) of the SFA to enter into
                    agreements with the alleged insider traders to pay civil penalties, thereby
                    dispensing with the need for litigation. In fact, since Parliament eschewed the
                    “person-connected approach” (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> below for elaboration) under the now-repealed Securities
                    Industries Act (Cap 289) in favour of the “information-connected
                    approach” (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below for
                    elaboration) under the SFA, this was the first opportunity for this court to
                    holistically examine the elements that constitute inside information (which
                    elements would, of course, apply equally to criminal insider
                trading).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This appeal was heard together with Civil
                    Appeals Nos 149 and 150 of 2010, which were, respectively, an appeal and a
                    cross-appeal from a separate but related suit, Suit No 129 of 2008. Suit
                    No 129 of 2008 was also jointly heard with Suit No 71 of 2009 before
                    the Judge. In Suit No 129 of 2008, Lew sought specific performance of
                    WBL’s obligation to issue him shares under its Executive Share Option
                    Scheme. It was undisputed that the funds Lew had used to exercise his share
                    options under WBL’s Executive Share Option Scheme had come from his sale
                    of 90,000 of his shares in WBL (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>
                    above), which was the transaction alleged to constitute insider trading in the
                    context of the present appeal. The substantive merits of Civil Appeals
                    Nos 149 and 150 of 2010 will be dealt with in a separate judgment (see
                        <em>WBL Corporation Ltd v Lew Chee Fai Kevin</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 13).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties involved</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lew</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Lew was a senior employee at WBL. He was a
                    trained accountant and had joined WBL as its Group Financial Controller in 1998.
                    At the material time, he was the Group General Manager of WBL’s Enterprise
                    Risk Management group, which was in charge of developing and implementing an
                    enterprise-wide risk management strategy for WBL. Lew resigned from WBL on
                    19 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">MAS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       MAS is the respondent in the appeal and the
                    plaintiff in Suit 71 of 2009 below. Under s 232 of the SFA, MAS may,
                    with the consent of the Public Prosecutor, seek a civil penalty against a person
                    whom it believes has contravened any provision in Pt XII of the SFA
                        (<em>ie</em>, the “Market Conduct”
                    provisions). This was in fact MAS’s approach in the present
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">WBL and its senior personnel </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       WBL is the company whose shares (referred to
                    hereafter as “WBL shares”) were the subject of the alleged insider
                    trading. It is a public company listed on the Singapore Exchange Ltd
                    (“SGX”). At the material time, it had about 90 active
                    subsidiaries. Its principal business is in Technology Manufacturing, Automotive
                    Distribution, Technology Solutions and Investments. Its Technology Manufacturing
                    Division was the main contributor to WBL’s turnover, contributing more
                    than 50% in 2006 and 2007. The substance of the alleged inside information
                    concerned the financial performance of three subsidiaries under the Technology
                    Manufacturing Division: Multi-Fineline Electronix Inc (“M-Flex”),
                    MFS Technology Ltd (“MFS”) and Wearnes Precision (Thailand)
                    Limited (“WPT”), respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the material time, in addition to Lew, who
                    (as just mentioned) was WBL’s Group General Manager for Enterprise Risk
                    Management, WBL’s senior management consisted of the following persons:
                    (a) Mr Tan Choon Seng (“C S Tan”) as its Chief
                    Executive Officer (“CEO”); (b) Mr Wong Hein Jee
                    (“Wong”) as its Chief Financial Officer; and (c) Mr Tan
                    Swee Hong (“Swee Hong”) as its Company Secretary and Group General
                    Manager for Legal and Compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       C S Tan, Wong and Swee Hong were
                    MAS’s witnesses at the trial. Mr Soh Yew Hock (“Soh”),
                    a non-independent and executive director of WBL, testified for Lew. Soh retired
                    on 16 July 2007 and was no longer with WBL at the time of the trial. He was
                    not present at the internal executive meeting at which the inside information
                    was allegedly acquired by Lew (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>–<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The expert witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Lew’s expert witness was Mr Timothy
                    James Reid, a partner at Ferrier Hogdson, a firm that specialises in corporate
                    turnover and restructuring. MAS’s expert witness was Mr Christopher
                    Chong Meng Tak (“Chong”). Chong is a financial and corporate
                    consultant based in Singapore and is currently a director of ACH Investments Pte
                    Ltd, a specialist corporate advisory firm with operations in Australia, China,
                    India, Singapore and the US.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The chronology of events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     An insider trading transaction generally
                    comprises three important events:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the acquisition of inside
                        information by the alleged insider/defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     the <em>acting</em> on the
                        inside information by the alleged insider/defendant (<em>eg</em>, by buying or selling the shares of the company
                        concerned); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     the subsequent release of the inside information into the public
                        domain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the present case, the factual background
                    was not disputed by the parties. What was disputed was <em>the
                        significance and reliability</em> of the information which Lew
                    received and the interpretation of the market behaviour of WBL’s share
                    price after that information was released to the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Event No 1 – The 2 July 2007 General Management
                Council meeting </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     General Management Council
                    (“GMC”) meetings were instituted in WBL in 2004 to support the
                    Board of Directors in strategic, operational and financial matters. The weekly
                    GMC meetings were chaired by C S Tan and attended by members of
                    WBL’s senior management. The agenda for the meetings depended on whether
                    the meetings were operational or financial meetings. At financial meetings, it
                    was common for financial forecasts to be presented by WBL’s finance
                    department. The presentation materials were not distributed because of their
                    confidential nature. It was at such a GMC meeting, held on 2 July 2007
                    (“the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting”), that Lew acquired the
                    alleged inside information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Information (A): WBL’s forecast loss for the third quarter
                of the financial year for 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting was a
                    financial meeting. It was held two days after 30 June 2007, the date on
                    which the third quarter of the financial year for 2007
                    (“3Q FY07”) ended. At the meeting, there was a presentation
                    of WBL’s financial forecasts for 3Q FY07 and the fourth quarter of
                    the financial year for 2007. The presentation forecasted that WBL would make a
                    loss of either $2.3m (<em>excluding</em> M-Flex’s and
                    MFS’s forecasted performance) or $0.4m (<em>including</em> M-Flex’s and MFS’s forecasted
                    performance). The forecast was based on the actual results for April and May
                    2007 as well as the estimated results for June 2007. The forecast did not take
                    into account the possible impairment charge on WPT that is referred to in
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Information (B): The impairment charge over WPT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     WBL’s subsidiary, WPT, had been making
                    significant losses for some time. During previous GMC meetings, the possibility
                    of WBL taking an impairment charge over WPT had already been discussed. An
                    impairment charge is a one-time write-off against a company’s assets. The
                    effect of the impairment charge would be to adjust the book value of the
                    company’s assets downwards to reflect their fair value, and this is
                    reflected as a <em>loss</em> on the company’s profit
                    and loss statement. In the present case, <em>the parties did not
                        dispute that the need for WBL to take an impairment charge over WPT was
                        discussed at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting.</em> Rather, they
                    disputed the degree of <em>likelihood</em>, as evinced
                    during the discussion at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, of such an impairment
                    charge being taken. MAS argued that it was very likely that an impairment charge
                    would be taken over WPT, whereas Lew argued that no actual decision was made at
                    the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting on whether or not such an impairment charge
                    would be taken and that, even if a decision had been made, the quantum of the
                    impairment charge had not yet been decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lew’s conversation with Swee Hong after the 2 July 2007
                GMC Meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, Lew
                    had a conversation with Swee Hong. The exact nature of the conversation was
                    disputed. MAS contended that Lew sought Swee Hong’s advice, in her
                    capacity as WBL’s Group General Manager for Legal and Compliance, as to
                    whether he could sell his WBL shares in the light of what had been revealed at
                    the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. Lew denied that he had sought Swee
                    Hong’s advice and contended that the conversation “did not amount
                    to advice”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> from
                    Swee Hong that he should not sell his WBL shares because the information
                    disclosed at the meeting was price-sensitive. In our view, this dispute of fact
                    is immaterial. Regardless of whether Lew had actually sought Swee Hong’s
                    advice, it was undisputed that Swee Hong had told Lew that it would not be
                    prudent for him to sell his WBL shares because the information at the
                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting was price-sensitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Event No 2 – Lew’s sale of 90,000 of his WBL shares
                on 4 July 2007 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Two days after the 2 July 2007 GMC
                    Meeting, <em>ie</em>, on 4 July 2007, Lew sold 90,000
                    of his WBL shares in three tranches of 30,000 shares each at $4.98 per share
                    (collectively, “the Transaction”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 5 July 2007, Lew e-mailed Swee Hong to
                    inform her about the Transaction. This was in accordance with WBL’s
                    internal procedures for the sale and purchase of WBL shares by WBL’s
                    senior management. On 9 July 2007, Swee Hong replied stating that, in her
                    view, the Transaction might be construed as insider trading because Lew
                    possessed price-sensitive information from the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. On
                    the same day (9 July 2007), Lew replied stating that he had sold his shares
                    to raise cash to exercise his share options under WBL’s Executive Share
                    Option Scheme. He also stated that he did not think the matters discussed at the
                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting were price-sensitive, but that if Swee Hong
                    considered his explanation insufficient, he would promptly buy back the same
                    number of WBL shares at no less than the price at which he had sold his WBL
                    shares. On the same day, Lew also submitted the requisite notices under the
                    WBL’s Executive Share Option Scheme as were necessary to exercise his
                    share options.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Swee Hong replied on 10 July 2007
                    pointing out that Lew had sought her advice on 2 July 2007, and that she
                    had advised then that it would not be prudent for him to deal in WBL shares in
                    the light of the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. She then advised that it would
                    nevertheless be improper for him to repurchase the same number of WBL shares
                    from the market.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subsequent developments for Lew</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 12 July 2007, C S Tan asked
                    Lew to give a statement to the law firm, Allen and Gledhill LLP
                    (“A&amp;G”), in respect of the Transaction. After A&amp;G took a
                    statement from Lew, he was summarily suspended from duty with immediate effect.
                    On 17 July 2007, WBL lodged a Suspicious Transaction Report with the
                    Commercial Affairs Department in respect of the Transaction. On
                    11 September 2007, MAS examined Lew pursuant to s 154 of the SFA and
                    took a statement from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It should be noted that Lew did not sell all
                    his WBL shares and still possessed 227,771 of such shares at the time of these

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     MAS’s claim against Lew was based on
                    s 218 of the SFA (“s 218”), which sets out what is
                    “prohibited conduct by [a] connected person in possession of inside

                        of those securities of that corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was undisputed that limbs (a) and
                    (b) had been satisfied in the context of the present appeal. Lew, as a
                    senior employee of WBL, was “connected” to WBL within the meaning
                    of s 218(5) of the SFA, and the information he allegedly possessed at the
                    material time “concern[ed]” WBL. The issues arising in this appeal
                    were therefore as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     What information concerning WBL did
                        Lew possess at the material time
                    (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was the information concerning WBL which Lew possessed at
                        the material time (referred to hereafter as “the Information”)
                        generally available (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the Information was not generally
                        available, would a reasonable person expect it to have a material effect on
                        the price or value of WBL shares if the Information were generally available
                        (“Issue 3”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     Did Lew know or ought he reasonably to have known
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       the Information was not
                            generally available (“Issue 4(a)”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_24-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       if
                            the Information were generally available, it might have a material
                            effect on the price or value of WBL shares
                            (“Issue 4(b)”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Under s 218(4) of the SFA, if MAS proves
                    that Lew possessed information concerning a company to which he was connected
                        (<em>ie</em>, WBL) and, that such information
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Information, in the context of the
                    present appeal) was not generally available, the <em>presumption</em> arises that Lew <em>knew</em>
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Information was not generally
                        available; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the Information were generally available, it might have a material
                        effect on the price or value of WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The burden of
                    proof would then be shifted to Lew to rebut this presumption (“the
                    presumption of knowledge under s 218(4)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: What did the Information consist of?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Judge found (at [53] of the Judgment) that the Information
                    consisted of the following pieces of information:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     WBL had forecasted a loss of either
                        $2.3m (excluding M-Flex’s and MFS’s forecasted performance) or
                        $0.4m (including M-Flex’s and MFS’s forecasted performance) in
                        3Q FY07 (“the Loss Forecast”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was <em>very
                            likely</em> for WBL to take a <em>significant</em> impairment charge on WPT in 3Q FY07
                        (“the Significant Impairment Prospect”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     as a result of
                        (a) and (b) above, it was <em>very
                            likely</em> that WBL would incur a <em>significant</em> overall loss for 3Q FY07 (“the
                        Significant Overall Loss Forecast”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Lew argued that the Judge was wrong to make
                    the above findings because she failed to fully consider the surrounding facts
                    which affected the <em>reliability or certainty</em> of the
                    results presented. In particular, Lew submitted that the Judge was wrong to find
                    that WBL had made a <em>reliable</em> forecast of loss. As
                    we point out below, however (at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>),
                    although the argument with regard to reliability is an important one, it was not
                    appropriate to raise it at this threshold stage of ascertaining what the
                    Information consisted <em>of</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Lew argued that what was discussed at the
                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting was too uncertain and preliminary to be reasonably
                    relied on. Implicit in Lew’s argument at this stage of the inquiry was the
                    proposition that information of an <em>uncertain</em> or
                        <em>unreliable</em> nature could not be treated as part
                    of the Information. To resolve this issue, we need to examine what constitutes
                    “information” under the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal interpretation of “information”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Under s 132A(1) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 185, 1970 Rev Ed) , “information” was interpreted
                    more specifically as “knowledge of a particular event or situation such
                    as advice, communication, intelligence, news, notification and the like”
                    (see the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v Choudhury</em>
                    [1979–1980] SLR(R) 766 at [19]). However, it is quite clear from the present s 214 of
                    the SFA that “information” is meant to be interpreted more widely.
                    Section 214 of the SFA does not define “information”
                    exhaustively but adopts an inclusive definition that includes a wide range of
                    information as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[I]nformation” includes —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    matters of supposition and other matters
                                that are insufficiently definite to warrant being made known to the

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    matters relating to the intentions, or
                                the likely intentions, of a

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    matters relating to negotiations or

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    information

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>e</em>)    information that
                                a person proposes to enter into, or had previously entered into one
                                or more transactions or agreements in relation to securities or has
                                prepared or proposes to issue a statement relating to such
                                securities; and</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Our current provisions on insider trading are
                    based on Australian legislation and Australian courts have taken a wide approach
                    in interpreting the term “information”. The New South Wales
                    decision of <em>R v Rivkin</em> [2004] NSWCCA 7
                        at [126] (reported in part in
                    (2004) 59 NSWLR 284, but not with regard to the points that are germane to
                    the present appeal) concerns a case of insider trading pursuant to the
                    Australian Corporations Act 2001 (the Australian legislation on insider
                    trading). The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with
                    McInerney J’s decision in the Supreme Court of Victoria case of
                        <em>Commissioner for Corporate Affairs v Green</em>
                    [1978] VR 505 at 511 (“<em>Green</em>”),
                    that information did not have to be “factual knowledge of a concrete
                    kind”. McInerney J also held in <em>Green
                        (at 5</em>11) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In many cases a hint may suggest information or may enable an inference to
                        be drawn as to information. Information about impending stock movements or
                        share movements may often be veiled. Discussion concerning such a movement
                        may often take the form of “mooting” but not deciding a
                        matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is also significant to note that the leading local author in this
                    field observes that “[t]he reference to ‘matters of
                    supposition’ in [limb (a) of the definition of
                    “information” in s 214 of the SFA] in effect means that
                    information may include rumours circulating in the market” (see Hans
                    Tjio, <em>Principles and Practice of Securities Regulation in
                        Singapore</em> (2nd Ed, LexisNexis, 2011) (“<em>Tjio</em>”) at para 8.12); in this regard, the
                    learned author has also referred to the following (italicised) observations by
                    Young J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales decision of <em>Hooker Investments Pty Ltd v Baring Bros Halkerston &amp; Partners
                        Securities Ltd &amp; Ors</em> (1986) 10 ACLR 462 (at 468) as
                    having been reflected in the phrase “matters of supposition” in
                    limb (a) of the definition of “information” in s 214 of
                    the SFA (see <em>Tjio</em> at para 8.12,
                    note 54):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To my mind information in [s 128(1) of the Securities Industry (NSW)
                        Code] goes further than knowledge and includes the situation where someone
                        has been informed of something which he does not know to be true nor does he
                        care whether it is true or not. In other words, <em>information may include a rumour that something has happened with
                            respect to a company which a person neither believes nor
                            disbelieves</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Indeed, as alluded to above (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>), the issue of reliability is not relevant at
                    this particular juncture, although it is certainly significant with regard to
                    Issue 2 (<em>ie</em>, whether the Information was
                    “generally available”) and Issue 3 (<em>ie</em>, if the Information had been generally available, whether a
                    reasonable person would expect it to have had a “material effect”
                    on the price or value of WBL shares). Put simply, Issue 1 relates to the
                    very broad and general question as to <em>what</em>
                    constitutes “information” in the first place, whereas the issue of
                    reliability (and, we might add, certainty) relates to the quite separate
                    question as to the nature <em>and</em> quality of that
                    “information”. Indeed, in so far as Issue 1 is concerned,
                    “information” might well include knowledge of an uncertain,
                    predictive or speculative nature. Therefore, while Lew disputes the <em>certainty</em> and <em>reliability</em>
                    of the information which he acquired from the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, this
                    did not prevent that information from being information which he possessed
                    within the meaning of s 218. It bears repeating that s 218 has various
                    cumulative stages of inquiry (as seen above at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) and, therefore, <em>parties should be
                        careful that their respective arguments do not conflate the different stages
                        of inquiry</em>. Whilst the definition of “information”
                    under s 214 of the SFA might appear wide, as the leading local author in
                    this area of the law perceptively observes (referring to the relationship, which
                    we have just noted, between Issue 1 on the one hand and Issue 2 and
                    Issue 3 on the other; see <em>Tjio</em> at

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings on Lew’s knowledge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is well-established that an appellate court
                    should defer to the trial judge’s finding of fact unless it is established
                    that the finding of fact is plainly wrong or unjustified on the totality of the
                    evidence before the trial judge (see, for example, the decision of this court in
                        <em>TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi and another
                        appeal</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 543), particularly where the
                    veracity and credibility of witnesses are concerned (see, for example, the
                    decision of this court in <em>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 307). In this vein, we noted
                    that the Judge’s findings were largely based on: (a) the finding that
                    Lew was an unreliable witness; and (b) a preference for the testimonies of
                    C S Tan, Wong and Swee Hong over that of Lew.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(A)   Finding relating to the Loss Forecast</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Lew does not dispute that he <em>knew</em> WBL made the Loss Forecast at the 2 July 2007
                    GMC Meeting. As noted above, Lew’s case against the reliability of the
                    Loss Forecast was a red herring at this stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(B)   Finding relating to the Significant Impairment Prospect </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although the Judge did not cite Lew’s
                    admissions against himself in the Judgment, Lew made important admissions in his
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) and during
                    cross-examination with regard to the need for WBL to take a significant
                    impairment charge on WPT. In his AEIC, Lew admitted that “WPT’s
                    problems and need for assets impairment were discussed since the last quarter of
                    2006 and throughout 2007 during GMC meetings and other ‘offline’
                        meetings”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Lew clearly admitted that he knew that C S Tan, the CEO of
                    WBL, had made it very clear at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting that there was a
                    need for WBL to take a full impairment charge on WPT for 3Q FY07. Lew also
                    admitted that he knew that a full impairment charge on WPT would involve a
                    substantial sum of about $22m to $30.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Judge accepted, at [46] of the Judgment, the testimony of
                    C S Tan, Wong and Swee Hong that “any attendee of the
                    2 July 2007 GMC Meeting would know that the decision to impair was almost a
                    certainty”. Lew admitted that no one else at the meeting could
                    corroborate his evidence that he did not know an impairment charge on WPT was
                    very likely to materialise. Furthermore, Lew’s argument that it was not
                    likely for him to know that an impairment charge would be taken on WPT in
                    3Q FY07 was in direct contradiction to the objective evidence on record,
                        <em>ie</em>, the minutes of the Audit Committee
                    meetings (“ACM”) and GMC meetings from February 2007 to
                    2 July 2007, which showed the growing inevitability and increasing
                    likelihood of an impairment charge being taken on WPT. Lew was present at all
                    those meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To elaborate, in the 9 February 2007 ACM
                    minutes, it was stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Committee agreed that no impairment charge be recorded
                        at 31 December 2006. However, the Committee said that the
                        performance of WPT will need to be monitored; an impairment of the assets
                        will need to be considered if WPT performs worse than the projections of a
                        $3.1m loss for Q207 (excluding the effects of one-off charges such as the
                        retrenchment payments).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, at the time of the 9 February 2007 ACM, WPT had already
                    recorded, for the first quarter of the financial year for 2007
                    (“1Q FY07”), losses that were greater than the projected
                    losses, and there were already discussions on the necessity of taking an
                    impairment charge on WPT. WBL’s management deferred the decision because
                    of the possibility of WPT securing contracts from new customers and undertaking
                    cost reduction initiatives to reduce its losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the 9 April 2007 GMC meeting minutes,

                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Wong] stated … the key assumptions made by management and
                        mentioned that the updated impairment analysis is heavily dependent on a key
                        assumption of getting a new key customer … WPT is in an advanced
                        stage of negotiation with [the new customer] for hard-disk drive business
                        and believe that WPT will be able to turnaround with this key customer who
                        offers a much better pricing and volume.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In response to Dr Cham Tao Soon’s question on the value of

                        the value at risk is $22 million, excluding freehold land and building.
                        If freehold land and building are included, the value at risk is

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Cham Tao Soon enquired about the expected date that the [deal with

                            The AC [Audit Committee] agreed.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ms Tan Bee Nah added that the benchmark should not be against the

                    the taking of an impairment charge was the prospect of WPT obtaining a new key
                    customer. WBL’s senior management also recognised that the final decision
                    as to whether or not to take an impairment charge over WPT could not be deferred
                    indeterminately as WPT struggled to get a new customer, and agreed that

<p class="Judg-1">The objective evidence clearly demonstrated a strong likelihood of a
                    full impairment charge on WPT being taken in 3Q FY07. C S Tan
                    testified that it was clear that an impairment charge had to be recognised since
                    WPT had failed to get the new key customer discussed during the 8 May 2007
                    AMC (see above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Lew attempted to discount the effect of the
                    GMC minutes set out above by arguing that GMC meetings were not taken seriously
                    by WBL’s senior management. To this end, he labelled GMC meetings as being
                    a “grand master’s circus”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and argued that no substantive
                    decisions were taken at such meetings and that decisions made were not
                    implemented. However, we agreed with the Judge that the evidence did <em>not</em> support Lew’s case: even Lew’s own
                    witness, Soh, admitted that GMC meetings were important to WBL’s business.
                    Lew later admitted that confidential information such as financial data was in
                    fact discussed at GMC meetings. Indeed, it seems incredulous, in our view, that
                    the senior management of WBL would have carried out weekly GMC meetings since
                    2004, only to make no substantive decisions at such meetings or to fail to
                    implement decisions made at such meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Lew also argued that no actual decision to
                    take an impairment charge on WPT for 3Q FY07 was made at the 2 July
                    2007 GMC Meeting. He argued this on the basis that: (a) previous meetings
                    were inconclusive as to whether an impairment charge on WPT would be taken;
                    (b) there was no quorum at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting to make a
                    decision on whether or not such an impairment charge should be taken; and
                    (c) there was no discussion at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting of a profit
                    warning, which would have to be issued in the event of WBL taking an impairment
                    charge on WPT. The Judge did not find that an <em>actual</em> decision to take an impairment charge on WPT for
                    3Q FY07 was made at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting – instead, her
                    finding was that it was <em>very likely</em> that a
                    significant impairment charge on WPT would be taken for 3Q FY07.
                    Lew’s arguments were, in contrast, pegged at the higher threshold of an
                        <em>actual</em> decision on the taking of an impairment
                    charge being made at the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting. This is not surprising,
                    not least because it would have been disingenuous, in the light of the evidence
                    on record, for Lew to have argued that it was not very likely for an impairment
                    charge to be taken over WPT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We also agreed with the Judge’s
                    rejection of Lew’s argument that the management of WBL had extended the
                    deadline for taking the impairment charge on WPT to 31 July 2007
                        (see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> of the Judgment). The
                    extension of the deadline to 31 July 2007 was in reference to possible
                    plans to divest the plants of WPT, which would affect only the <em>quantum</em> of the impairment charge taken on WPT but
                        <em>not</em> the decision to take an <em>impairment charge</em> itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     However, Lew argued that he could not have
                    known the quantum of the impairment charge on WPT or that it was very likely the
                    impairment charge would be significant. We found this difficult to believe in
                    the light of his admission that he knew the value-at-risk on WPT’s assets
                    was a ballpark figure ranging from $22m to $30.5m (see above at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>). Lew’s argument was based on the
                    following statement in the minutes of the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting, as
                    follows: “[in] the past 2 weeks, there were visits related to a big
                    buyer looking into WPT. This week the buyers are going to make a decision and
                    that it may be necessary to get a new valuer as the old valuation was
                    unrealistically high”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, we rejected this
                    argument; in particular, we agreed with the Judge that “[e]ven taking
                    into account any possibility of a sale of WPT (at a distressed price or any
                    other valuation), the evidence strongly suggested that the impairment would
                    still be a substantial one, even if it may not be at $30 million)”
                        (see [52] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(C) Finding relating to the Significant Overall Loss
                Forecast</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We also agreed with the Judge’s finding
                    that, based on the Loss Forecast and the Significant Impairment Prospect, it was
                    very likely that WBL would incur a significant overall loss in 3Q FY07. We
                    acknowledged that the Loss Forecast was small <em>in
                        itself</em>, being only $0.4m in the best-case scenario (<em>ie</em>, with M-Flex’s and MFS’s forecasted
                    performance included). However, the <em>combination</em> of
                    the Loss Forecast (which projected a loss of either $0.4m or $2.3m) and the
                    Significant Impairment Prospect (which projected a write-off of between $22m to
                    $30.5m) led to the inference that it was very likely WBL would incur a
                    significant overall loss in 3Q FY07 because WBL would not be able to offset
                    the substantial losses arising from a significant impairment charge being taken
                    on WPT with profits from WBL’s other subsidiaries. Put simply, the Loss
                    Forecast and the Significant Impairment Prospect were not only significant
                    pieces of information in themselves, but also had to be viewed holistically,
                    particularly in the context of the issues in this appeal in general and this
                    issue (Issue 1) in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion for Issue 1: Particularising the
                Information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Having regard to the above analysis, we upheld
                    the Judge’s findings with regard to the specific pieces of information
                    comprised in the Information. However, the inquiry into the <em>nature</em> of the Information (which is crucial to the resolution of
                    Issue 2 and Issue 3 to be considered below) would have been clearer if
                    Lew’s knowledge had been specifically particularised. With respect, the
                    Judge should have distinguished between what Lew knew about WBL’s state of
                    affairs with <em>full certainty</em> (see (a), (b),
                    (c) and (d) below) and what Lew knew about WBL’s state of
                    affairs with <em>a high degree of probability</em>
                    (deduced, in the main, from what he knew about WBL’s state of affairs with
                    full certainty) (see (e), (f) and (g) below). Specifically, the
                    Information should be particularised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lew knew WBL’s senior
                        management had forecasted a loss for 3Q FY07;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     he knew the Loss Forecast was based on
                        actual results in April and May 2007 but estimated results for June
                        2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     he knew
                        WBL’s senior management had discussed the possibility of taking an
                        impairment charge on WPT and had been discussing this possibility since the
                        last quarter of 2006 (“4Q FY06”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     he knew that WBL’s senior
                        management had estimated an impairment charge on WPT to be in the range of
                        $22m to $30.5m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_e"></a>(e)     he knew that it was very likely an impairment charge on WPT would be taken
                        in 3Q FY07;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_f"></a>(f)     he knew that it was very likely the impairment charge on WPT would be
                        significant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_g"></a>(g)     he knew that it was very likely WBL would incur significant overall
                        loss for 3Q FY07.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The importance of particularising the
                    Information became especially apparent in relation to the inquiry with regard to
                    Issue 2, which involved determining if the Information was
                    “generally available”. In <em>Hannes v Director of
                        Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2)</em> (2006) 60 ACSR 1
                        (“<em>Hannes v DPP</em>”), another case
                    under the Australian insider trading legislation (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above) <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with ours, the Supreme
                    Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal likewise stressed the
                    importance of particularising the information known by the alleged insider
                    trader in determining if the inside information was “generally
                    available”. In particular, the court stated (at [382]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… even if it can be said that <em>aspects</em>
                        of the particularised information were generally available, that did not
                        lead to the conclusion that the particularised information <em>as a whole</em> was generally available … It was
                        the <em>combination</em> of information particularised
                        which was significant in relation to the offence charged. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The importance of particularising the
                    Information is especially critical when it is disputed whether the Information
                    can be <em>deduced</em> from information that was generally
                    available. In the present case, even if the public could reach the same
                    conclusions as those contained in the Information (<em>eg</em>, even if the public could deduce that WBL would incur a
                    significant overall loss for 3Q FY07), the <em>grounds</em> on which the public made such deductions could be
                    completely different. If the Information is not sufficiently particularised so
                    as to state clearly the <em>bases</em> of Lew’s
                    knowledge, it would be difficult to compare the qualitative differences in the
                    Information with the deductions made by the public. We therefore bore this in
                    mind with regard to the next issue, <em>ie</em>, whether
                    the Information was “generally available” within the meaning of
                    s 218 of the SFA; and it is to this issue (<em>ie</em>, Issue 2) that our attention must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Was the Information “generally
                available”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legislative history of the insider trading regime under the
                SFA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Before considering the statutory definition of
                    “generally available” under the SFA, it is important to consider
                    the legislative history of the insider trading regime under the SFA. The
                    previous legislative framework for insider trading under s 103 of the
                    Securities Industry Act (Cap 289, 1985 Rev Ed) followed almost exactly
                    s 128 of the Australian Securities Industry Act 1980 (Act 66 of 1980),
                    which was repealed in Australia sometime towards the end of the 1980s. The
                    previous scheme emphasised a person’s connection with the company (the
                    “person-connected approach”). In particular, there were,
                    historically, five elements for the offence of insider trading under
                    s 103(1) of the Securities Industry Act, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     the person in question was an
                        insider at the material time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     he was in possession of price-sensitive
                        information;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     he
                        obtained the information <em>by virtue of his position as an
                            insider</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     the information was not generally available;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     he dealt in the
                        securities of the corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the previous
                    framework made it very difficult to catch “tippees”, <em>viz</em>, persons who acquired price-sensitive information
                    from an insider. Section 103(3) of the Securities Industry Act required the
                    “tipee” to be aware that the person who tipped him was an insider.
                    Under this framework, there was no statutory definition of “generally
                    available” information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Securities and Futures Bill (Bill 33
                    of 2001) (“the Bill”) “redefine[d] the laws on insider
                    trading” (<em>per</em> BG Lee Hsien Loong
                    (“BG Lee”), Deputy Prime Minister, during the second reading
                    of the Bill (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 (“<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (5 October
                    2001)”) at col 2137)). The Bill transformed our legislative
                    framework on insider trading from a person-connected approach to an
                    “information-connected” approach (<em>id</em>
                    at col 2159). This was a clear move away from the position in the US, where
                    the theory of insider trading is based on fiduciary duties. Under the new
                    information-connected approach, there is no longer a need to trace the
                    information back to its original source, which was needed under the
                    person-connected approach. The examination focuses, instead, on the <em>nature</em> of the information and whether it: (a) was
                    generally available; and (b) would have a material effect on the price or
                    value of the shares in question – which is the <em>present</em> legal position under s 218.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Our shift to an information-connected regime
                    was inspired by Australia’s own shift from a person-connected approach to
                    an information-connected approach. Our insider trading provisions in
                    Pt XII, Div 3 of the SFA were based wholly on the insider trading
                    provisions in the Australian Corporations Act 2001. Hence, the judicial and
                    academic interpretations in Australia are of particular importance in
                    interpreting the provisions of the SFA. While the specific Australian provisions
                    on which the SFA was based have since been repealed, those provisions were
                    reproduced as different sections in the same act, <em>ie</em>, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> below); the law of insider trading in
                    Australia has therefore not changed in substance. The only significant amendment
                    to the law of insider trading in Australia was the Financial Services Reform Act
                    2002, which added the option of a civil penalty for insider
                trading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The main policy reason for the transformation
                    of our insider trading regime to a focus on the <em>nature</em> of the information was as follows (<em>per</em> BG Lee, Deputy Prime Minister, in <em>Singapore </em><em>Parliamentary Debates</em>
                    (5 October 2001) at col 2136):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the core, the mischief of insider trading lies in tilting the playing
                        field unfairly against other market participants. Those who knowingly have
                        inside information should be prohibited from trading, whether or not they
                        are connected with the company. The intent is to address the <em>core evil of trading while in possession of undisclosed market
                            sensitive information</em>, instead of having liability depend on
                        a person’s connection with the company. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, under an information-connected approach, the identification of
                    what constitutes <em>inside</em> information is central to
                    the enforcement of the regime. The significance of the Australian Corporations
                    Act 2001, which (as noted above) we followed in the SFA, was the insertion of a
                    statutory definition for “generally available”
                information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statutory definition of “generally available”
                information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The statutory definition of “generally
                    available” information is to be found in s 215 of the SFA

                                be affected by the information; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   since it was so made known, a reasonable

                    provisions recognised the need to define what was inside information so that the
                    insider trading regime would be easier to enforce (see generally Alan Griffiths,
                        <em>Fair Shares for All, Insider Trading in
                        Australia</em> (Australian Government Publishing Service, 1989)
                    (“the <em>Griffiths Report</em>”)), the
                    statutory definition in the SFA and in Australia is, in fact, a <em>negative</em> formulation of what is inside information,
                        <em>ie</em>, information that is <em>not</em> generally available. The problem with a negative formulation
                    of inside information is that if the definition of “generally
                    available” is not interpreted properly, it may lead to over-regulation,
                        <em>ie</em>, the capturing as insider trading
                    transactions of those transactions that do not actually involve the kind of
                    “undisclosed market sensitive information” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (5 October 2001) at
                    col 2137) that Parliament originally aimed to regulate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Judge referred to the test in
                        s 215(<em>a</em>) as the “readily
                    observable test”, the test in s 215(<em>b</em>)
                    as the “publishable information test” and the test in
                        s 215(<em>c</em>) as the “market analysis
                    test” (see the Judgment at [55]). This is the same terminology referred to in the
                    Australian academic material. Whilst these terms are helpful, they should
                    nevertheless not replace the language of the statute itself. While the Judge
                    recognised (at [55] of the
                    Judgment) that “these definitions [were] not without difficulty”
                    and made observations on the s 215(<em>a</em>)
                    “readily observable test” and the s 215(<em>b</em>) “publishable information test”, she decided
                        (at [63] of the Judgment) not
                    to lay down a definitive view as to what legal interpretation should be adopted
                    for s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>). The Judge held (at [63] of the Judgment) that it was “not strictly
                    necessary” to decide which interpretation should be adopted in the
                    Singapore context since “MAS, in its submissions, did not dispute that
                    the information which Lew sought to rely on (<em>viz</em>,
                    the press releases and announcements of companies listed in Singapore or the US)
                    satisfies the readily observable test or publishable information test”.
                    The Judge thus only decided on the legal interpretation of the
                        s 215(<em>c</em>) “market analysis
                    test” – more specifically, she considered whether the Information
                    could consist of “deductions, inferences and conclusions” drawn
                    from the information referred to in s 215(<em>a</em>)
                    and s 215(<em>b</em>) and, on that basis, be regarded
                    as “generally available” information within the meaning of
                        s 215(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     With respect, we beg to differ from the
                    Judge’s approach of interpreting s 215(<em>c</em>) without considering the legal interpretations of
                        s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>), since (as we have just noted) the scope of the
                    information which falls within s 215(<em>c</em>) is
                    clearly and necessarily dependent upon what information is generally available
                    under s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>). The Judge compared the deductions which could be
                    made from information indisputably available in the public domain with the
                    Information (as determined in Issue 1), held that the deductions were not
                    of the “same character” or “quality” as the
                    Information, and thus held that the Information was <em>not</em> “generally available” under s 215.
                    However, the Judge failed, with respect, to state <em>exactly
                        who</em> made the deductions, inferences and conclusions from the
                    generally available information for the purposes of s 215(<em>c</em>). The Judge mentioned “the market”,
                    “a person”, “an investor”, “a reasonable
                    investor”, “the public” and the “investing
                    public” at different points of her analysis as the perspective from which
                    the deductions, inferences and conclusions were made (see [74]–[81] of the Judgment). We are of the view, however, that a
                        <em>consistent</em> point of reference must be
                    identified, because different people with different viewpoints and skills would
                    necessarily make different deductions, inferences and conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Without interpreting s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) in
                    conjunction with s 215(<em>c</em>), the Judge had in
                    fact interpreted s 215(<em>c</em>) in a vacuum.
                    Considering the fundamental importance of the statutory definition of
                    “generally available” information in establishing the offence of
                    insider trading under the SFA, all three limbs of s 215 ought to be
                    interpreted clearly and rationally in relation to each another. Indeed, the
                    Judge recognised that there was a tension between the policy of efficiency
                    embodied in s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>c</em>) and the policy of fairness in s 215(<em>b</em>) (see the Judgment at [58]). Furthermore, while s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>c</em>) do
                    not identify <em>to </em><em>which
                        parties</em> the information must be readily observable (for
                        s 215(<em>a</em>)) and <em>which
                        are the parties who</em> make the deductions, conclusions and
                    inferences (for s 215(<em>c</em>)),
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) in fact identifies the parties
                    that the information must be made known to: the information must be brought to
                        “<em>the attention of persons who commonly invest in
                        securities</em> of a kind whose price or value might be affected by
                    the information” [emphasis added]. For ease of reference, we will refer,
                    collectively, to “persons who commonly invest in securities” as
                    “Common Investors”. The significance of the Common Investor will
                    be emphasised again when we consider Issue 3, as the Common Investor is
                    also reflected in s 216 of the SFA in determining if a reasonable person
                    would expect the Information, if it were generally available, to have a material
                    effect on the price or value of the WBL shares. The only difference between the
                    Common Investor in s 216 and in s 215(<em>b</em>)
                    of the SFA is that the Common Investor in s 215(<em>b</em>) (“the s 215(<em>b</em>)
                    Specific Common Investor”) is one who commonly invests in securities of a
                        <em>kind </em><em>whose price or value
                        might be affected by the information</em> in question, and this group
                    of s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific Common Investors will
                    vary depending on the nature of the information. In contrast, the Common
                    Investor in s 216 is the Common Investor of securities generally. As
                    already mentioned, we will return to this point later when we consider
                    Issue 3. In conclusion, the differences in, and the relationship between,
                    the three limbs of s 215 must be reconciled satisfactorily within the
                    entire statutory framework of s 215. However, before attempting to
                    reconcile the three limbs of s 215, we ought to discuss the correct
                    approach to be adopted in interpreting this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Approach to s 215 – unique aspects of Singapore’s
                insider trading regime </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It has been observed that Australia’s
                    insider trading legislation contains one of the broadest prohibitions against
                    insider trading in the world (see Keith Kendall, “Information that is
                    ‘generally available’ under the insider trading provisions in
                    Australia” (2006) 21 (1) Journal of International Business Law 29).
                    It is interesting to note that our legislation is even stricter than
                    Australia’s legislation inasmuch as Singapore is the only jurisdiction to
                    have legislatively removed (via s 220 of the SFA) the requirement of
                    “prov[ing] intention to use” the inside information. Our
                    Parliament has made it clear that s 220 was enacted to legislatively
                    overrule the decision in <em>PP v Ng Chee Keong</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 1176, which required proof of an “intent to
                    use” the inside information for insider trading (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (5 October 2001) at
                    cols 2137 and 2138). There is therefore no longer any requirement of
                    proving the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>
                    to use inside information in order to prove a contravention of either s 218
                    or s 219 of the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Instead, we have the presumption of knowledge
                    under s 218(4) that applies where “connected persons” (as
                    defined in s 218(5)) are involved. This presumption is also unique to
                    Singapore. The <em>Griffiths Report</em> in the Australian
                    context did consider if the evidential burden of proving lack of <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> should be placed
                    on the insider trader, but this was not accepted in the final legislation
                    enacted in Australia. Singapore’s framework for insider trading is
                    therefore very strict where connected persons are concerned: once a connected
                    person is proved to be in possession of information concerning the company to
                    which he is connected and once such information is proved to be <em>not</em> “generally available”, the connected
                    person is <em>presumed</em> to know that: (a) the
                    information was not generally available; and (b) if the information were
                    generally available, it <em>might</em> be material to the
                    price or value of the company’s securities. As was stated in the
                    parliamentary debates on the Bill, the intention of the presumption of knowledge
                    under s 218(4) was to impose “greater discipline on those in
                    fiduciary positions” (<em>per</em> BG Lee in
                        <em>Singapore </em><em>Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> (5 October 2001) at col 2149). However, it was
                    also recognised that “without the need to prove any intent, a balance
                    ha[d] to be struck <em>so that it would not be too onerous for
                        operators</em>, especially non-executive directors” [emphasis
                    added] (<em>ibid</em> at col 2149).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Although there is much truth in the
                    Judge’s view (at [63] of the
                    Judgment) that “the efficacy of the insider trading regime would be best
                    maintained by imposing a <em>narrow</em> view of what is
                    ‘generally available information’” [emphasis added], it must
                    nevertheless be borne in mind that a <em>balance</em> needs
                    to be struck, lest the SFA result in regulating the use of information in an
                        <em>over</em>-expansive fashion contrary to
                    Parliament’s intent – a point which is illustrated by the preceding
                    paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Adopting too narrow an interpretation of what
                    is “generally available” information may capture information that
                    is fortuitously (yet legitimately (within the confines of the legislation))
                    gained. For example, the Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Criminal
                    Appeal held in <em>R v Firns</em> (2001) 51 NSWLR 548
                        (“<em>Firns</em>”), that information
                    could be gained simply by the defendant being fortuitously present in court
                    during the release of a judgment (in that case, a judgment of the Supreme Court
                    of Papua New Guinea). Alternatively, information can also be gained from
                    inferences and deductions gained through extra diligence or exceptional
                    analytical skills by a sophisticated investor. Fortuitously gained information
                    and information gained through diligence or analytical prowess were not, in our
                    view, part of the mischief Parliament intended to address when it stated that
                    the core evil of insider trading was in “tilting the playing field
                    unfairly against other market participants” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (5 October 2001) at
                    col 2137). The insider trading regime is not intended to have a chilling
                    effect on the trading of securities. The approach to s 215 should therefore
                    be neither narrow nor broad, but commonsensical. Once the interpretation of each
                    limb of s 215 is rationalised with its underlying policy consideration,
                    what constitutes “generally available” information will be neither
                    under- nor over-inclusive. With these considerations in mind, let us turn to a
                    consideration of the various limbs of s 215.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between s 215(a) and s 215(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The information Lew relied on as being
                    “generally available” under either s 215(<em>a</em>) or s 215(<em>b</em>) (“the
                    Generally Available Information on WBL”) was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     various press releases from
                        WBL;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     announcements regarding WBL posted on SGX’s or WBL’s websites;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_c"></a>(c)     public
                        announcements by WBL’s subsidiaries such as WPT and
                    M-Flex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge held that there was “no real dispute
                    that such information satisfie[d] the readily observable test [under
                        s 215(<em>a</em>)] <em>or</em> publishable information test [under s 215(<em>b</em>)]” [emphasis added] (see the Judgment
                        at [72]). Implicit in the
                    Judge’s statement is that s 215(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) have <em>separate</em> spheres of application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We agree with the Judge that
                        s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) have <em>separate</em> spheres
                    of application. In particular, s 215(<em>b</em>) is
                    far more specific than s 215(<em>a</em>) and contains
                    clearer and more stringent requirements. Put simply, under s 215(<em>b</em>), the information has to be “made known in a
                        <em>manner</em> that would, or would be likely to,
                    bring it to the attention” [emphasis added] of specific parties (namely,
                    the s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific Common Investors), and
                    has a time requirement of a “reasonable period for [the information] to
                    be disseminated among [the s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific
                    Common Investors]” (see also <em>Firns</em>). Under
                    a literal interpretation of s 215, s 215(<em>a</em>) should not be constrained by s 215(<em>b</em>) since s 215(<em>b</em>) is stated
                    to be “without limiting the generality of paragraph (<em>a</em>)”. Hence, Parliament clearly intended that
                    information that falls within the scope of s 215(<em>b</em>) should be subject to more stringent requirements in order to
                    be considered “generally available” information, compared to
                    information that falls within the scope of s 215(<em>a</em>). Such a construction is supported by not only the literal
                    language of s 215(<em>a</em>), but also the relevant
                    legislative history of s 215(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) – a point to which our
                    attention now briefly turns.</p>

                        Report</em> only proposed the “publishable information”
                    test (as reflected in the Australian version of s 215(<em>b</em>)) for “generally available” information. The
                    Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 at
                    para 327 highlighted that the “readily observable” test (as
                    reflected in s 215(<em>a</em>)) was added because of
                    concerns that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>information directly observable in the public
                            arena</em> would not be regarded as generally available, as it has
                        not been ‘made known’. It was considered that a person could be
                        liable for insider trading where he/she traded in securities on the basis
                        of, for example, an observation that the body corporate had excess stocks in
                        a yard. This was not the intention of the provisions. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1">The relevant legislative history of the Australian equivalent of
                        s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) has in fact been thoroughly and perceptively explored
                    by Mason P in <em>Firns</em>, whose analysis we
                    gratefully adopt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Put simply, there are at least two <em>contrasting</em> theories of insider trading. The first is
                    the “market fairness” or “equal access” theory
                    (which mandates a strict approach towards insider trading), whereas the second,
                        <em>viz</em>, the “market efficiency”
                    theory, mandates a far more benevolent approach towards insider trading (see
                    generally <em>Firns</em> at [40]–[52]). The <em>Griffiths Report</em>
                    endorsed the <em>former</em> theory, which is reflected in
                    the “publishable information” test under the Australian equivalent
                    of s 215(<em>b</em>) (see <em>Firns</em> at [55]).
                    Indeed, had the relevant recommendation in the <em>Griffiths
                        Report</em> been adopted (see <em>Firns</em>
                        at [55]),
                    “s 1002B(2) [the Australian equivalent of s 215] would have
                    contained s 1002B(2)(b) [the Australian equivalent of s 215(<em>b</em>)] (or something similar), <em>but
                        not</em> s 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian equivalent of
                        s 215(<em>a</em>)] <em>and perhaps
                        not </em><em>s </em>1002B(3) [the Australian
                    equivalent of s 215(<em>c</em>)]” [emphasis
                    added] (see <em>Firns</em> at [56]). However, when the Australian equivalent
                    of s 215 was enacted, the Australian equivalent of s 215(<em>a</em>), which endorsed the <em>latter</em> theory (<em>viz</em>, the
                    “market efficiency” theory), was <em>also</em> promulgated. Mason P perceptively observed that the
                    Australian Parliament had wanted to avoid “[penalising] individual
                    initiative and diligence” and to endorse (as well as encourage)
                    “cleverness, swiftness and efficiency”, at least with respect to
                    “some types of information” (see <em>Firns</em> at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>).
                    Therefore, the “market efficiency” theory was also embraced by
                    inserting “the opaque words ‘readily observable
                    matter’” (<em>ibid</em>) in the Australian
                    equivalent of s 215(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The result, as stated in Mason P’s
                    perceptive analysis in <em>Firns</em>, was that “the
                    Griffiths Committee’s clear vision of an underlying policy of promoting
                    fairness in the market through equal access to information <em>became badly blurred in the legislative process</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see <em>Firns</em> at [53]). What further resulted was, in the
                    learned judge’s view, “<em>a form of legislated
                        astigmatism</em> because <em>the attempt to converge
                        </em><em>essentially incompatible policy
                        goals</em> … produced <em>a patchy
                        blurring</em> of the image” [emphasis added] (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As Mason P correctly observed,
                    “[t]hese policy and drafting decisions left the courts with <em>a difficult interpretative task</em>” [emphasis added]
                    (see <em>Firns</em> at [58]); the learned judge proceeded to observe thus (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The task is focussed by provisions requiring the Court to give effect to
                        legislative purpose and permitting recourse to extrinsic material ...,
                            <em>but</em> the assistance is <em>blurred by the conflicting goals embedded in the essentially
                            two-pronged definition of “information generally
                            available”</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     He also astutely pointed out, as follows (see
                        <em>Firns</em> at [61]–[62]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is unnecessary to go further than recognising that endorsement of the
                        concept of economic efficiency appears to underlie the Parliament’s
                        decision to insert s 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian equivalent of
                            s 215(<em>a</em>)] into s 1002B(2) [the
                        Australian equivalent of s 215], in preference to the exclusive market
                        fairness paradigm espoused by the Griffiths Committee and trumpeted in the
                        general parts of the Explanatory Memorandum [to the Australian Corporations
                        Legislation Amendment Bill 1991]. Whether or not this means that the
                        Australian legislative regime is out of step with insider trading regulation
                        in other countries ... is neither here nor there. This Court’s task is
                        to enforce Australian law, but only after having determined the proper scope
                        of its prohibition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A legislative commitment to an efficient as well as a fair market does not
                        translate automatically into deciding that the “efficient”
                        single trader is to be encouraged at all costs. <em>But it
                            does reinforce my decision to interpret </em><em>s 1002B(2)(a) literally, without forcing its language into a
                            predetermined purposive mould</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the circumstances, Mason P’s
                    following conclusion as to what is “readily observable matter”
                    (here, in the context of the Australian equivalent of s 215(<em>a</em>)) is not at all surprising (see <em>Firns</em> at [68]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Corporations Law</em> does not define
                        “readily observable matter”. <b><em>The drafting
                            history and the opening words of s 1002B(2)(b) [the Australian
                            equivalent of s 215(</em></b><b>b</b><b><em>)] shows that the generality of the
                            words in s 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian equivalent of
                            s 215(</em></b><b>a</b><b><em>)] are not to be limited by s 1002B(2)(b) [the Australian
                            equivalent of s 215(</em></b><b>b</b><b><em>)]. What also emerges</em></b>
                        clearly from a comparison between s 1002B(2)(a) and s 1002B(2)(b)
                        is that <b><em>in s 1002B(2)(a) the legislature
                            deliberately held back from placing information under an embargo until
                            the lapse of a fixed time or even a reasonable time from some fixed
                            point of actual disclosure. Section 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian
                            equivalent of s 215(</em></b><b>a</b><b><em>)] was inserted as an alternative in
                            order not to penalise the efficient, the speedy or the
                            diligent</em></b> – at least to the degree encompassed by the
                        opaque “readily observable matter”. [emphasis in original;
                        emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The learned judge also observed that
                    “[s]ometimes information [would] consist of matter that [was] directly
                    visible, yet … not … [‘]observable[’], at least not
                    [‘]readily[’] so”, with “[e]xamples [being] a message
                    which is widely published yet encrypted or a gold nugget lying in a remote
                    corner of a desert” (see <em>Firns</em>
                        at [73]). Mason P was also
                    of the view that interpreting “readily observable matter” as
                    “facts directly observable in the public arena”, whilst
                    “helpful in some contexts”, nevertheless “[could not] be
                    taken too far” (citing the example, just noted, of the published
                    encrypted message (<em>ibid</em>)). Indeed, the learned
                    judge pertinently pointed out that “[a]t other times”, such an
                    approach would be “too narrow”, citing the facts of <em>Firns</em> itself as an example (at [74]). In his view, “[s]ome information
                    has the capacity to generate its own dissemination” inasmuch as
                    “[i]ts initial disclosure may be limited, yet the type of information
                    involved and the initial group of persons to whom it is disclosed may ensure
                    that it gets abroad” (<em>ibid</em>). In this
                    regard, “[f]or the purposes of s 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian
                    equivalent of s 215(<em>a</em>)] it does not matter
                    how many people actually observe the relevant information”, and neither
                    is this particular provision “concerned with the time that is likely to
                    elapse between the information becoming [‘]readily observable[’] and
                    when it was in fact observed” as “[i]nformation may be readily
                    observable even if no one observed it” (see <em>Firns</em> at [77]).
                    This is, of course, entirely consistent with the broad ambit of the provision,
                    as noted below (at [78]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mason P also emphasised the important
                    impact that <em>modern technology</em> has on the
                    interpretation of what is “readily observable matter”; in the
                    learned judge’s words (see <em>Firns</em>
                        at [78], which was cited by
                    Gzell J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales decision of <em>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v MacDonald and
                        others (No 11)</em> (2009) 71 ASCR 368
                    at [1130]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if ready observability were to be limited to perceptibility by the
                        unaided human senses, the published judgment of a Supreme Court is readily
                        observable. A fortiori if, as I believe to be the case, one is not confined
                        to the unaided human senses. <em>Since the demise of the pony
                            express and semaphore and the advent of telephone, telex, facsimile,
                            television and the internet we have come to observe information
                            immediately yet indirectly. Our human senses are engaged, but with the
                            aid of modern means of telecommunication. Absent statutory clarification
                            or restriction, there will be cases where failure to advert to this
                            modern reality skews the true scope of </em><em>s 1002B(2)(a) [the Australian equivalent of </em><em>s 215(</em>a<em>)] despite emphasis
                            on the modifying adverb “readily”.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     At this juncture, we pause to observe that
                    although there was a dissenting judgment by Carruthers A-J in <em>Firns</em>, the difference between the majority
                    (Mason P, with whom Hidden J agreed) and the minority
                    (Carruthers A-J) turned, in the final analysis, on their respective views
                    as to what constituted the “public” domain. The majority held,
                    consistently with the principles set out above by Mason P, that ready
                    observability ought <em>not</em> to be tested by reference
                    to a hypothetical person “within Australia”. Elaborating on his
                    views above, Mason P opined thus (see <em>Firns</em>
                        at [81]–[82]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a further difficulty with the direction that ready observability
                        is to be tested from the stance of a hypothetical person “within
                        Australia”. I have already touched upon it. The direction suggests or
                        infers that the <em>readiness</em> of the
                        perceptibility is also to be judged from the viewpoint of individuals
                        located in Australia using their natural senses but without regard to modern
                        methods of telecommunication. The unelaborated direction referring to
                        “those in Australia” carries the seeds of miscarriage when it
                        is recognised that television, the internet (including e-mail) and other
                        means of telecommunication such as the phone and fax are part and parcel of
                        how Australians generally and investors in particular readily perceive
                        events.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A sudden crisis in the Middle East may have an immediate impact upon the
                        value of Australian oil shares. That crisis may generate immediate coverage
                        through a cable television provider such as CNN and/or it may be objectively
                        of such a nature that one would expect people to jump on to the telephone,
                        facsimile or e-mail to communicate price-sensitive information almost
                        instantaneously. If the crisis occurs in the dead of the Australian night
                        but during prime time in the United States of America the information is
                        only <em>not</em> readily observable if one reads
                        “in Australia” into the statute and then construes those words
                        in a manner divorced from the realities of the modern world of global
                        telecommunication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On the other hand, Carruthers A-J was of
                    the view, in agreement with counsel for the respondent, “that the matter
                    must be <em>readily observable</em> by the public at large
                    as it is that group of persons who are capable of trading on the share market in
                    Australia, or in shares of corporations which are formed or carry on business in
                    Australia” [emphasis in original] (<em>id</em>
                        at [113]). The learned judge
                    proceeded to observe as follows (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The public at large in that sense must, at least, include the Australian
                        public, as the provisions contained in the <em>Corporations
                            Law</em> are clearly designed principally to protect Australian
                        investors by promoting equal access to information for investors. For
                        information to be generally available on the basis that it consists of
                        “readily observable matter”, it must, at least, be <em>readily observable</em> by members of the Australian
                        public. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Significantly, however, the issue of who
                    should properly constitute the “public”, which was the crux of the
                    disagreement between the majority and the minority in <em>Firns</em>, does <em>not</em> arise in the
                    context of the present appeal. More importantly, the perceptive analysis by
                    Mason P of the Australian equivalent of s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) is <em>not</em> affected by this disagreement. Indeed, there may, in
                    our (provisional) view, be no real need for a definitive definition as such of
                    the “public”, with everything depending, in the final analysis, on
                    the precise facts and circumstances of each case, bearing in mind the
                    observation in <em>Firns</em> that information may be
                    “readily observable” notwithstanding the fact that nobody has
                    observed it (see above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>).
                    Furthermore, any interpretation of “public” must be careful to
                    allow the market efficiency policy, as exemplified by s 215(<em>a</em>), to be facilitated lest over-regulation of
                    information leads to a situation where the standards and quality of information
                    drops to the “lowest common denominator” for the market. Indeed,
                    investors would be deterred from taking the initiative to find out information
                    of a higher quality from public resources if they are going to be penalised for
                    their diligence on the basis that the information acquired is not readily
                    observable in “public”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Although there is some potential inconsistency
                    between s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) when viewed against the backdrop of their Australian
                    origins (and as set out clearly by Mason P in <em>Firns</em> above), the SFA itself does in fact embody both the
                    “market fairness” or “equal access” theory <em>as well as</em> the “market efficiency” theory.
                    Although the main policy aim of the insider trading provisions in the SFA is to
                    prevent insiders from taking advantage of their position to use information
                    unfairly (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above), this does
                    not detract from the legislation itself recognising that insider trading
                    legislation should not impede <em>economically
                        efficient</em> exchange of information. The Judge also recognised
                        (see [62] of the Judgment) that
                    the SFA provisions on insider trading were part of MAS’s
                    “continuing efforts to ensure that our markets operate <em>fairly</em> and <em>efficiently</em>”
                    [emphasis added] (see MAS’s Insider Trading Consultation Document
                    (27 January 2001) at para 21). The defences and exceptions to insider
                    trading found in ss 222 to 231 of the SFA also reflect the recognition of
                    economic efficiency as an equally vital policy consideration in
                    Singapore’s insider trading legislation (see Alexander Loke, “From
                    the Fiduciary Theory to Information Abuse: The Changing Fabric of Insider
                    Trading Law in the U.K., Australia and Singapore” (2006) American Journal
                    of Comparative Law 123 at p 166).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Given the fact that the SFA attempts to
                    accommodate <em>both</em> the seemingly disparate theories
                    of insider trading as noted briefly in the preceding paragraph, the following
                    question remains: can s 215(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) nevertheless be reconciled (a
                    point which was not considered in <em>Firns</em> itself)?
                    In fact, when we examine how the parity of information defences in s 231 of
                    the SFA work with s 215, we can identify <em>some</em>
                    reconciliation of these seemingly disparate policies. While s 215(<em>b</em>) embodies the policy of market fairness,
                        s 231(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SFA read with
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) also allows the policy of market
                    efficiency to operate. Section 231(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the SFA makes it clear that s 215(<em>b</em>) is
                    largely intended to control “insiders” who have “made
                    known” the information. Under s 231(1)(<em>a</em>), it is a defence in any proceedings for a contravention of
                    s 218(2) or s 219(2) if the court is satisfied that “the
                    information came into the … person’s possession <em>solely</em> as a result of the information having been made known as
                    referred to in section 215(<em>b</em>)(i)”
                    [emphasis added]. Therefore, s 215(<em>b</em>) does
                    not penalise the efficient and speedy Common Investor who acted on the
                    information in question <em>immediately</em> after it was
                    made known as long as he did not, as an insider, know of the information before
                    it was released. How s 215(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) can be <em>completely</em> reconciled is indeed an interesting issue. However,
                    as the parties did not address us on it, we will not venture to say anything
                    more in the context of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Nevertheless, what <em>is</em> clear – and this is of the first importance from a
                        <em>practical</em> perspective – is that
                        s 215(<em>a</em>) is <em>clearly
                        broader in scope</em> than s 215(<em>b</em>). As recognised above at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>, s 215(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) have separate spheres of
                    application. Hence, there must be fact situations that fall within the ambit of
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) but <em>not</em> within s 215(<em>a</em>). However,
                    while we need not, for the purposes of the present case, define the precise
                    contours of s 215(<em>b</em>), we note that there must
                    be certain types of information that Parliament intended to subject to the more
                    stringent requirements of s 215(<em>b</em>) and, for
                    those types of information, s 215(<em>a</em>) cannot
                    be used as a backdoor to avoid the more stringent requirements of
                        s 215(<em>b</em>). It is, nevertheless, likely
                    that, with the broad purview of s 215(<em>a</em>), the
                    sphere of application of s 215(<em>b</em>) will be
                    narrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     
          <em>However</em>, as
                    already noted above (at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>), the
                    Generally Available Information on WBL relied upon by Lew would clearly fall
                    within <em>both</em> s 215(<em>a</em>) <em>and</em> s 215(<em>b</em>). The issue that next arises, therefore, is whether or
                    not s 215(<em>c</em>) is satisfied on the facts of the
                    present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 215(c)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     It is clear that the central figure with
                    regard to both s 215 and s 216 of the SFA is the Common Investor. As
                    we noted above (at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>), unlike
                    s 216 (which relates to “persons who commonly invest in
                    securities”
                    <em>generally</em>), s 215(<em>b</em>) focuses on the narrower category of Common Investors of
                    securities “of a <em>kind whose price or value would be
                        affected by the information</em>” [emphasis added].
                        Section 215(<em>b</em>) requires a more specific
                        <em>focus</em> on a particular group of Common
                    Investors in order to ensure effective and fair disclosure of a specific type of
                    inside information as defined by that provision itself. Section 216, on the
                    other hand, relates to the issue of <em>materiality</em>
                    pursuant to <em>Issue 3</em> in the present appeal
                    and, in that regard, the materiality of the inside information has to be
                    determined from the <em>perspective of the Common Investor of
                        securities generally</em>. However, despite this difference which may
                    lead to different specific characteristics depending on the nature of
                    information in each case, at a general level, the s 216 Common Investor and
                        s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific Common Investor should
                    both possess the same basic level of professional knowledge as elaborated below
                    in <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Under s 215(<em>c</em>), it is the Common Investor who has to make the deductions,
                    conclusions or inferences mentioned. Hence, it is from the Common
                    Investor’s perspective from which it is deduced, concluded or inferred
                    from the generally available information in s 215(<em>a</em>) and s 215(<em>b</em>) what
                    information exists in the market itself. This perspective requires that
                        <em>an objective standard</em> be applied to such
                    deductions, conclusions and inferences, which must also be
                reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Both parties in the appeal agreed that the
                    Common Investor possesses general professional knowledge and adopted the
                    definition of the “reasonable investor” as set out in the Sarawak
                    High Court decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v Chua Seng
                        Huat</em> [1999] 3 MLJ 305 at 329–330
                        (“<em>Chua Seng Huat</em>”). In <em>Chua Seng Huat</em> (at 328), the reasonable investor
                    was described as “an investor who possesses general professional
                    knowledge as opposed to the said daily retailer or a person who has made
                    specific researches”. Therefore while the s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific Common Investor and s 216 Common Investor may
                    have different specific characteristics depending on the specific nature of
                    information in each case, at a general level, both the s 216 Common
                    Investor and s 215(<em>b</em>) Specific Common
                    Investor should possess the same basic level of professional knowledge. In this
                    regard, we adopt the definition of the “reasonable investor” as
                    set out in <em>Chua Seng Huat</em> which refers to an
                    investor with “general professional knowledge” with an additional
                    dimension added to the Common Investor in <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a> for the inquiry under Issue 3. This particular
                    definition strikes a balance between daily retailers out to make a quick buck
                    without the general knowledge of the considerations that would inform an
                    investor as to whether or not to buy or sell securities on the one hand, and
                    expert investors who specialise in the research of investing in securities on
                    the other. The court in <em>Chua Seng Huat
                    (at 3</em>28) elaborated that “general professional
                    knowledge” included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     the ability to analyse and determine
                        the quality and the prospect of shares, which goes towards deciding when to
                        buy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        ability to do technical and fundamental analysis on information that is
                        freely available;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     the knowledge that fundamental analysis is the intrinsic valuation of
                        a stock, which involves studying financial stock ratio, operating ratio and
                        profitability ratio, and which also involves the use of variation measures
                        like price earning ratio, dividend yield and price-to-book
                    ratio;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        knowledge that technical analysis is concerned with examining the price and
                        the volume behaviour of a share; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_e"></a>(e)     the knowledge of how to read and analyse financial
                        accounts and statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We now proceed to analyse the
                    Generally Available Information on WBL from the perspective of a Common Investor
                    in accordance with the criteria set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s findings with regard to the Generally Available
                Information on WBL </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Whether or not the information in question was
                    generally available is to be assessed <em>at the time of the
                        alleged insider trading transaction</em> (see the Supreme Court of
                    Victoria decision of <em>R v Evans &amp; Doyle</em> [1999]
                    VSC 488), in the present case, as at 4 July 2007. Although the Judge
                    did not clarify precisely from whose perspective the deductions, conclusions and
                    inferences from the Generally Available Information on WBL were made, we agree
                    that the Generally Available Information on WBL that Lew relied on was too weak
                    for the Common Investor to draw the deductions, conclusions and inferences that
                    would enable him or her to arrive at the same content as that contained in the
                    Information. We will not set out the Generally Available Information on WBL in
                    detail again (which includes the financial results and announcements made by WBL
                    regarding its results and its subsidiaries) as the Judge has already succinctly
                    set it out in the Judgment at [9]–[14]. It would
                    suffice for us to hold that the financial results of WBL and its subsidiaries,
                    which showed decreasing profits, as well as the cautiously-worded
                    forward-looking statements by WBL could not have led the Common Investor to
                    deduce that: (a) WBL would suffer a loss in 3Q FY07; (b) WBL
                    would take an impairment charge on WPT in 3Q FY07, (c) the quantum of
                    the impairment charge would be significant; and (d) because of the
                    significant impairment charge, WBL would suffer significant losses in
                    3Q FY07. The logic behind Lew’s proposal of a “regression
                    analysis” based on the fact that the profits of WBL had been consistently
                    declining was not credible: in particular, a regression analysis based on six
                    points (which represent the available financial results for 2006 and the first
                    two quarters of 2007, see <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> below) of
                    declining profits was a very weak basis from which to lead the Common Investor
                    to infer that WBL would suffer a loss in the next quarter. Indeed, Lew himself
                    admitted the weakness of this logic:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… The mere fact that a company has suffered
                            declining profits for two quarters does not mean that the less
                                [<em>sic</em>] quarter is going to have even
                            less profit; right?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Judge was also correct to find it
                    “significant that no profit warning was issued” (see Judgment
                        at [78]). There was no basis in
                    the Generally Available Information on WBL for the Common Investor to deduce
                    that WBL was going to take an impairment charge on WPT in 3Q FY07 and that
                    even if such an impairment could be deducible, the Common Investor could not
                    from the Generally Available Information deduce the quantum of the impairment
                    charge. Lew himself admitted this during cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You are saying that these announcements [as

                            three announcements and they would be able to deduce that there is going
                            to be an impairment for WPT?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We hold, therefore, that the Common Investor
                    would not have been able to deduce, conclude or infer from the Generally
                    Available Information on WBL the same conclusions as those contained in the
                    Information. Further, even if we accept that the Common Investor could have
                    arrived at the same conclusions as those contained in the Information, we would
                    find that the deductions, inferences and conclusions from the Generally
                    Available Information on WBL would not satisfy the legal test embodied in
                        s 215(<em>c</em>) – an issue to which we now
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The legal test for s 215(c) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     We are of the view that the Judge applied the
                    correct legal test in relation to s 215(<em>c</em>) of
                    the SFA. MAS submitted that our courts should follow the New South Wales Court
                    of Criminal Appeal decision of <em>R v Hannes</em> (2000)
                    36 ACSR 72, which interpreted the Australian equivalent of
                        s 215(<em>c</em>). In <em>R v
                        Hannes</em>, the “generally available” information was
                    of a relatively higher quality than the information in our case. The insider was
                    an executive director of a bank that had advised a company, TNT Ltd
                    (“TNT”), in relation to a possible takeover. The “generally
                    available” information, comprising contemporaneous brokers’ reports
                    and newspaper articles, referred to TNT as a takeover target whose shares were
                    valued in excess of AU$2 each. The Common Investor could therefore have,
                    arguably, arrived at the <em>same conclusion</em> as the
                    insider from the generally available information –
                    <em>viz</em>, that there was going to be a takeover of TNT
                    and that the shares of TNT were worth more than AU $2 each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     However, this is where <em>R v
                        Hannes</em>, like <em>Hannes v DPP</em>,
                    emphasised the importance of <em>particularising</em> the
                    information concerned. The insider in <em>R v Hannes</em>
                    knew two particular pieces of information which the Common Investor did
                        <em>not</em> – namely: (a) the fact that the
                    insider’s bank was advising TNT in relation to the possible takeover; and
                    (b) the fact that TNT’s securities were placed on the bank’s
                    embargo list. These two particular pieces of information made the
                    insider’s information “<em>qualitatively
                        different</em>” from the informed analysis of the generally
                    available information. Put simply, it changed the “<em>quality</em>” of the insider’s information to
                    information that was of a higher reliability and certainty than the deductions,
                    conclusions and inferences arrived at by the Common Investor. As
                    Spigelman CJ (with whom Studdert and Dowd JJ. agreed) observed
                    (at [276]–[277]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>276</b>] In my opinion, the
                            information specified in the particulars [the subject of the charge of
                            insider trading] was <b>not of the same
                                character</b> as that contained in the brokers’ reports
                            [which were generally available to the public]. Those reports deduced
                            from the objective circumstances of the company the <b><em>possibility </em></b><em>of a takeover</em>.
                            The brokers’ reports also computed, on a variety of bases, the
                            brokers’ valuations, some of which were in excess of
                        $2.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>277</b>] The

                            more felicitously expressed in this respect, has an element of <b><em>probability</em></b> which is not present in any of the
                            brokers’ reports. ... In my opinion, nothing in the nature of the
                            “deductions, conclusions or inferences” contained in any
                            of the brokers’ reports suggested that it was based on <b>information of the same character as that contained in the
                                “information” as

<p class="Judg-1">This approach is not only logical and practical, but also consistent
                    with the legislative purpose of the SFA. We note, in particular, the <em>qualitative</em> distinction drawn with regard to the
                    character of the information (<em>ie</em>, whether what is
                    available to the general public is of the “<em>same
                        character</em>” as that available to the insider) as well as
                    the (corresponding) distinction drawn between the concept of what is <em>possible</em> on the one hand and what is <em>probable</em> on the other. Applying the test in <em>R
                        v Hannes</em>, information would only qualify as “generally
                    available” under s 215(<em>c</em>) if the
                    Common Investor could make deductions, conclusions or inferences from
                    information which were of the “same character” or
                    “quality” as the information the insider possessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     There is also another decision handed down by
                    the Federal Court of Australia –
                    <em>viz</em>, <em>Catena v Australian
                        Securities and Investments Commission (No 2)</em> [2010] FCA 865
                        (“<em>Catena</em>”) – that briefly
                    considered the Australian equivalent of s 215(<em>c</em>) (affirmed in <em>Catena v Australian
                        Securities and Investments Commission</em> [2011] FCAFC 32). <em>Catena</em> was an appeal from the decision of the tribunal
                        (<em>viz</em>, <em>YFFM and Australian
                        Securities and Investment Commission</em> [2010] AATA 340), and while
                        <em>R v Hannes</em> was not cited in <em>Catena</em>, the applicant relied on <em>R v
                        Hannes</em> before the tribunal <em>albeit</em>
                    for a different legal point. The tribunal was reviewing an order made by the
                    Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) under
                    the Australian Corporations Act 2001 in prohibiting the applicant (a broker)
                    from providing any financial services for a period for 5 years. This was
                    because the applicant had failed to comply with section 1043A(1) of the
                    Australian Corporations Act 2001 by procuring another person to acquire shares
                    in a company while in possession of inside information of that company. The
                    tribunal affirmed the order of the ASIC and <em>Catena</em>
                    affirmed the decision of the tribunal. The specific facts were that a broker
                    knew that there would be a likely merger or takeover proposal for a company at a
                    price of about AU$2.15 by mid-August 2006 at the latest and, with this
                    information, he tried to solicit his clients to acquire shares in that
                    particular company. The broker tried to argue, on appeal in <em>Catena</em>, that there was evidence of market rumours speculating
                    that the company was a likely takeover target and, therefore, the information
                    about the merger or takeover proposal was generally available. At [65] of <em>Catena</em>,
                    the Federal Court of Australia accepted that the tribunal found, not
                    unreasonably, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The broker’s] evidence merely established that there was <em>high level rumour or market speculation</em>, but
                            <em>it did not suggest that there existed market rumour
                            or speculation that </em><b><em>extended both to the
                            likely price and timing of a takeover</em></b>. It was <b><em>that part of the information possessed by the
                            applicant</em></b> – that the price was about $2.15 and that the
                        timing of the takeover was in about the middle of August –
                        <b><em>that was critical to the Tribunal’s assessment
                            that information was not generally available.</em></b> [emphasis added
                        in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, a similar test to that in <em>R v
                        Hannes</em> was implicitly applied in <em>Catena</em>, as the information which the broker possessed was
                    clearly of a different and better character and quality than the market rumours
                    that were generally available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Lew, on the other hand, proposed a
                    “rationality” test for s 215(<em>c</em>), utilising the test formulated by the US Supreme Court in
                        <em>Basic Incorporated, et al, Petitioners v Max
                        L Levinson et al</em> 485 US 224 (1988) (“<em>Levinson</em>”), <em>ie</em>,
                    whether the information would significantly alter the total mix of information
                    available to common investors (see <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>
                    below). However, this <em>conflates</em> the materiality
                    test (to be determined pursuant to Issue 3) with the general availability
                    test (which is the issue presently being considered) inasmuch as the test in
                        <em>Levinson</em> only applies to determine if the
                    information in question would have <em>material</em> effect
                    (indeed, the decision of the US Supreme Court in <em>TSC
                        Industries, Inc, et al, Petitioners, v Northway, Inc</em> (1976)
                    426 US 438 (“<em>TSC</em>”), which dealt
                    with the test of <em>materiality</em> (and which will be
                    dealt with in more detail below at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>), was referred to in <em>Levinson</em>).
                    Further, the logic of Lew’s “rationality” test, with
                    respect, was singularly unpersuasive. Lew suggested that so long as it was
                    reasonable for a Common Investor to arrive at the same conclusion as the
                    insider, the insider’s information should be considered as generally
                    available under s 215(<em>c</em>). However, this
                    ignores the <em>qualitative</em> difference between the
                    Common Investor’s deduction on the one hand and the insider’s
                    information on the other, inasmuch as whilst both the Common Investor and the
                    insider may arrive at the same conclusion, the insider’s information is
                    nevertheless of a higher quality simply because it is based on information not
                    available to the Common Investor, which thus allows the insider to deduce the
                    conclusion with <em>greater </em><em>certainty</em> and <em>reliability</em>. In the
                    circumstances, to allow Lew’s “rationality” test to prevail
                    would reduce greatly the effectiveness of the legal framework of our insider
                    trading regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The “same character” or
                    “quality” criteria (pursuant to the test in <em>R v
                        Hannes</em>) may appear difficult to apply, but this test, which is
                    also the legal test for the purposes of s 215(<em>c</em>), is not, in the nature of things, an exact science – a
                    point which, we add, would apply to any other test for that matter. The fact
                    that the insider’s information is more particularised than the Common
                    Investor’s does <em>not necessarily</em> mean the
                    information relied upon by the Common Investor to make his deductions,
                    conclusions and inferences is not of the “same character” or
                    “quality” as the insider’s information. This would depend
                    upon whether the additional particularisations of the insider’s
                    information were such that they changed the “character” or
                    “quality” of the insider’s information (compared to the
                    information relied upon by the Common Investor to make its deductions,
                    conclusions and inferences). The yardstick for comparison is whether the
                    particulars of the insider’s information would have made the information
                        <em>more </em><em>certain</em> or
                        <em>reliable</em>, such that the probability of the
                    occurrence of what was deduced, concluded or inferred from the information would
                    have increased. This would reflect Parliament’s concern to ensure a level
                    playing field in the stock market inasmuch as insiders should not be investing
                    with more favourable odds (that were gained unfairly) compared to the Common
                    Investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this regard, we refer again to the
                    particularisation of the Information at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above. Even if we accept that based on the Generally
                    Available Information on WBL, the Common Investor could have arrived at the same
                    conclusions as those contained in the Information, the particularisation of the
                    Information clearly demonstrated that the deductions based on that information
                    were of a better quality. The Information was based on actual financial results
                    in April and May 2007 as well as on actual knowledge of the board’s
                    discussion of an impairment charge on WPT, including estimates of the quantum of
                    the impairment charge. <em>R v Hannes</em> also highlights
                    that the source of the information is an important factor in ascertaining its
                    reliability. Hence, the fact that the Information came directly from the senior
                    management of WBL made it more certain and reliable than information from
                    external sources. Thus, the Information was not of “same
                    character” or “quality” as the Generally Available
                    Information on WBL in which the Common Investor relies upon to make its
                    deductions, inferences and conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 2: The Information was not generally
                available </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     We thus found that the Information was not
                    generally available under all three limbs of s 215, especially
                        s 215(<em>c</em>). In the circumstances, the
                    presumption of knowledge under s 218(4) would be triggered and the burden
                    of proof would be shifted to Lew to rebut the presumption of knowledge under
                    s 218(4) (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: If the Information was not generally available, would a
                reasonable person expect it to have a “material effect” on the price
                or value of WBL shares if it were generally available? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Once it is established that the information at
                    issue is “not generally available”, the next element to be
                    fulfilled under s 218(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SFA is
                    that if the information <em>had </em><em>been</em> generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to
                    have had a “material effect” on the price or value of the shares
                    concerned. In this regard, s 216 provides, in turn, that this requirement
                    is fulfilled “if the information would, or would be likely to, influence
                    persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to
                    subscribe for, buy or sell the … securities”, <em>viz</em>, the Common Investor, to whom we have already made reference
                    above (at <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It was common ground between the parties
                    – correctly, in our view – that materiality was to be assessed on
                    the date of the Transaction, <em>ie</em>, 4 July
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The general test for materiality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In interpreting s 218 read with
                    s 216 of the SFA, the parties agreed, and the Judge correctly held, that
                    the legal test for materiality is that established in the US Supreme Court
                    decision of <em>TSC</em> (see above at [89]) at 449, <em>ie</em>, information is <em>material</em>
                    if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there is a <em>substantial likelihood</em>
                        that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to
                        vote. …
                        <em>It does not require proof of a substantial likelihood
                            that disclosure of the omitted fact would have caused the reasonable
                            investor to change his vote</em>. What the standard does
                        contemplate is a showing of a substantial likelihood that, under all the
                        circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in
                        the deliberations of the reasonable shareholder. <em>Put
                            another way, there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure
                            of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as
                            having significantly altered the “total mix” of
                            information made available.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the test of materiality in the US has been furnished by
                    common law rather than by statute, the test in <em>TSC</em>
                    (“the <em>TSC</em> test”) is essentially the
                    same as that provided under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (see Baxt,
                    Black &amp; Hanrahan, <em>Securities and Financial
                        Services Law</em> (Chatswood, N.S.W.: LexisNexis Butterworths,
                    7th Ed, 2008) at para 18-17), and, by logical extension, also the same
                    as that under the SFA (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above,
                    where it is noted that the insider trading provisions of the SFA were derived
                    from the Australian Corporations Act 2001). US and Australian cases are thus
                    both relevant to the interpretation of s 218 read with s 216 of the
                    SFA. We pause to also note that the <em>TSC</em> test,
                    whilst originally formulated with reference to the test of materiality in
                    relation to Rule 14a-9 of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated
                    under the US Securities Exchange Act 1934, has since been applied in a variety
                    of other contexts, including the present (see, for example, Yvonne Ching Ling
                    Lee, “The Elusive Concept of “Materiality” Under U.S.
                    Federal Securities Law” (2004) 40 Willamette L Rev 661
                        (“<em>Lee</em>”) at
                    pp 662–663). This is not surprising in view of the fact that the
                        <em>TSC</em> test is based on <em>general principle</em> and is therefore of <em>general
                        applicability</em>. It is by no means a perfect test (see, for
                    example, <em>Lee</em> at pp 663–669), but every
                    test would, in the general nature of things, engender difficulties –
                    especially in the sphere of application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     We note that s 216 of the SFA does not
                    expressly state the <em>degree</em> of likelihood that the
                    information must have of influencing the Common Investor before that information
                    can be regarded as having a material effect on the price or value of the shares
                    in question. We are of the view that, in accordance with the <em>TSC</em> test, there must be “a <em>substantial</em> likelihood” that the information will
                    influence the Common Investor in order for a reasonable person to consider that
                    information as having a <em>material</em> effect on the
                    price or value of the shares. It goes without saying that, in applying the
                        <em>TSC</em> test, the influence cannot be <em>de minimis.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Despite the parties’ agreement as to the
                    legal test to be applied, the question of how much weight is to be accorded to
                    evidence of how the market actually reacted when the information became
                    generally available (“Market Impact Evidence”) was controversial.
                    This controversy was borne out in the respective parties’ submissions.
                    Both parties agreed that Market Impact Evidence could be a relevant
                        consideration,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> but
                    Lew went much further, submitting that the qualitative or predictive analysis of
                    whether a Common Investor would have been influenced by the Information should
                    “ultimately be verified and validated”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> by actual market
                    impact, pursuant (so Lew argued) to US and Australian authorities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This
                    particular issue was crucial to the resolution of this part of the present
                    appeal because a major part of Lew’s case was based on the argument that
                    the Transaction had no <em>actual impac</em>t on the
                    market. We disagreed with Lew and agreed with the Judge (at sub-para (b) of
                        [85] of the Judgment) that, based on
                    the language of s 216, there was no need for there to be an <em>actual impact</em> on a company’s share price in order
                    to establish the element of materiality. The Judge arrived at this conclusion
                    based on the plain language of s 216, and we agree. Nevertheless, given
                    what has been a tendency in some cases to ignore the plain statutory language
                    (in so far as some Australian cases are concerned) as well as the plain
                    formulation of the <em>TSC</em> test (in so far as some US
                    cases are concerned), we find it necessary to address the conflicting case
                    authorities on the weight which should be accorded to Market Impact Evidence.
                    This is especially so since Lew cited some of these cases in support of his
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How much weight should be given to Market Impact Evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Even though the <em>TSC</em> test focuses on the likely importance of information to a
                    Common Investor’s decision-making process, courts in the US and Australia
                    have sometimes ignored any qualitative assessment from the Common
                    Investor’s point of view and have relied, instead, solely on Market Impact
                    Evidence in order to determine materiality (as shorthand, we will refer to this
                    approach as “the Market Impact Approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     For example, in <em>Australian
                        Securities and Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia
                        Pty Limited (No 4</em>) [2007] FCA 963 (“<em>Citigroup</em>”), the only factor relied on to
                    establish materiality (albeit by way of <em>obiter
                        dicta</em>) was a rise in the price of the stock concerned before the
                    close of trading on Friday and the opening price of the stock after it had been
                    made known on Monday morning that the company was the subject of a takeover
                    offer (see <em>Citigroup</em> at [578]). Taken to the
                    extreme, under the Market Impact Approach, price movements (or the lack thereof)
                    have been treated as determinative <em>even when they
                        contradicted expert evidence on how Common Investors would be expected to
                        react</em>. In <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v
                        John F Mangan </em><em>Jr</em> 598 F
                    Supp 2d 731 (“<em>Mangan</em>”)
                    at 735–737, for example, the court found the information immaterial
                    because there was no significant change to share prices despite expert evidence
                    that Common Investors would likely be influenced by the information. Courts have
                    even gone so far as to state that if a company’s disclosure of information
                    has no actual effect on its share price, the information disclosed must be
                    immaterial <em>as a matter of law</em> (see <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory</em> 114 F 3d 1410
                    (3rd Cir, 1977) (“<em>Burlington</em>”)
                    at 1425, which was cited in <em>Mangan</em>
                    at 735). Indeed, Lew cited both <em>Burlington</em>
                    and <em>Mangan</em> in support of his position that Market
                    Impact Evidence was necessary in order to successfully invoke s 218 of the
                        SFA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In contrast, some cases maintain that Market
                    Impact Evidence is <em>not</em> determinative proof of
                    materiality. For example, the court in <em>United States of
                        America v Paul A Bilzerian</em> 926 F 2d 1285 (1991)
                        (“<em>Bilzerian</em>”) at [16] expressly rejected the defendant’s
                    argument that the absence of any market fluctuation in the relevant stock
                    demonstrated that the information was not important to investors. Although this
                    was not a decision on insider trading as such, it was nevertheless one in
                    relation to other types of securities fraud which, under US legislation, contain
                    the <em>same</em> materiality requirement as that which
                    applies in the context of insider trading. The court clarified at [16], on the basis of <em>TSC</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whether a public company’s stock price moves up or down or
                        stays the same after [disclosure] does not establish the materiality of the
                        statements made, though stock movement is <em>a factor the
                            jury may consider relevant</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In our view, the court in <em>Bilzerian</em> was correct to treat Market Impact Evidence as
                    relevant <em>but not</em> conclusive, and the other cases
                    cited above were wrong to treat Market Impact Evidence as <em>conclusive</em>, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    First, this approach (<em>viz</em>, the Market Impact Approach) is precisely what the drafters
                    of the Australian provisions, from which our s 218 is adopted, sought to
                    avoid. The Griffiths Committee, in recommending the adoption of the
                    “reasonable person” standard, explained that it was a concept
                    familiar to courts and <em>removed the need to rely on expert
                        opinion</em> (see The <em>Griffiths Report</em>
                    at para 4.4, in particular, para 4.4.6). The <em>Griffiths Report</em> also expressed the desire that Australian law
                    converge towards the “reasonable person” standard already
                    applicable in the US. Defining the “reasonable person” standard in
                    the US, the court in <em>TSC</em> made clear (at 449)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It does <em>not</em> require proof of a substantial
                        likelihood that disclosure of the omitted fact <em>would
                            have</em> caused the reasonable investor to change his vote.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Hence, our objective test of the likely
                    impact of the information on the Common Investor does <em>not</em> require the Common Investor to have <em>actually</em> changed his buying or selling behaviour (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>), which change the Market
                    Impact Approach necessarily presumes. The plain language of the Australian and
                    Singapore statutory provisions, together with the <em>TSC</em> test, indicates that materiality turns upon <em>a reasonable person’s view</em> of how the information
                        <em>would</em> be likely to influence the
                    decision-making processes of the Common Investor, as assessed <em>at the time of the alleged insider trade</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In contrast, the Market Impact Approach has
                    made the question of materiality one to be determined on an almost purely or
                    entirely <em>ex post facto</em> basis (see <em>Lee</em> at p 664). In the US, at least, there has been
                    concern that this has made the standard of materiality elusive and
                    “subject to scrutiny with the gloss of hindsight” (see
                    Steinberg &amp; Myers, “Lurking in the Shadows: The Hidden
                    Issues of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation FD”
                    (2002) 27 Journal of Corporation Law 173 at p 189).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Secondly, the Market Impact Approach assumes
                    that one can precisely attribute a certain market movement to the release of
                    certain information. This assumption may not be realistic depending on the
                    nature of the information. In the words of one commentator
                    (Richard C Sauer, “The Erosion of the Materiality Standard in
                    the Enforcement of the Federal Securities Laws” (2007)
                    62(2) Business Lawyer 317(41) (“<em>Sauer</em>”) at 325):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he market rarely presents a clean sheet on which to read the
                        significance of an issuer’s individual disclosures; <em>on any given day the price of a security reflects a variety of
                            developments</em> concerning the issuer, its industry sector, and
                        the market in general, not exclusively information released by the issuer.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even the court in <em>United States of America v Kevin
                        Heron</em> 525 F Supp 2d 729 (2007) (“<em>Heron</em>”), which Lew also cited as authority for
                    the conclusiveness of Market Impact Evidence, acknowledged (at [9]–[10]) the limitations of such evidence, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this Internet age, so much information is available to investors that
                        no disclosure ever takes place in isolation … it is at least
                        conceivable that two material items of information, released more or less
                        simultaneously, could cancel each other out and produce the appearance of
                        immateriality. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, even professional stock analysts often find themselves at a
                    loss to explain why market reactions differ so greatly from expectations (see
                        <em>Sauer</em> at p 322).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Thirdly, treating Market Impact Evidence as
                    being conclusive requires the court to rely heavily on expert evidence, which
                    can be greatly subjective. It is for good reason that the Griffiths Committee
                    preferred to adhere to a concept of the reasonable person standard (as stated
                    above in <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>) familiar to courts and
                    avoid over-reliance on expert opinion. In <em>Mangan</em>,
                    for example, the experts’ opinions diverged simply because the experts had
                    used different time windows. One expert also looked at intraday price movements
                    whereas the other did not. As we have already established above
                        (at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>), it is clear that
                    s 216 of the SFA <em>never intended that a finding of
                        insider trade should stand and fall based purely on which expert’s
                        opinion the court prefers.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    It is appropriate here to make a
                    clarification about the role of expert evidence. It has been argued that expert
                    evidence is necessary in establishing materiality (see Lyon &amp; du
                    Plessis, <em>Law of Insider Trading in Australia</em>
                    (Sydney: The Federation Press, 2005) (“<em>Lyon &amp; du
                        </em><em>Plessis</em>”) at p 29).
                    However, it is important to be clear <em>as to what the expert
                        evidence should pertain</em>. <em>Lyon &amp; du </em><em>Plessis</em>
                    does not refer to expert evidence pertaining to how to interpret market
                    movements, but, rather, expert evidence pertaining to whether information would
                    be likely to influence persons who commonly acquire securities. To this end, the
                    learned authors view expert evidence as “necessary to eliminate
                    speculative, subjective and disparate reasoning by individual members of the
                    jury” (see <em>Lyon &amp; du
                        </em><em>Plessis</em> at p 29). The proper
                    role of expert evidence, therefore, is to assist the court in establishing how
                        <em>a reasonable person</em>, <em>at the
                        time of the alleged insider trade</em>, would expect the information
                    to influence a Common Investor, and <em>not</em> to
                    establish, on hindsight, what actually happened to the market upon the release
                    of the information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In summary, Market Impact Evidence may be
                    considered as a relevant consideration in determining whether s 216 of the
                    SFA is fulfilled, but should not be taken – in and of itself – as
                    conclusive. We found it crucial to clarify this in the light of the cases cited
                    above, and in the light of Lew’s contention (see <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> above) that the qualitative or predictive
                    analysis of whether a Common Investor would have been influenced by the
                    information in question should “ultimately be verified and
                        validated”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> by Market Impact Evidence. If this
                    had been appreciated earlier, we could have avoided the misplaced type of
                    argumentation that we saw in this case, where the parties, instead of focusing
                    on whether and to what extent the Information was likely to operate in a Common
                    Investor’s decision-making process, focused their evidence and their
                    argumentation on extremely fine points of interpretation of WBL’s share
                    price movements. In fact, these fine points of interpretation were a pithy
                    demonstration of the difficulties with the Market Impact Approach as we
                    explained above at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>–<a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>, a point
                    which we will elaborate upon below when we consider the parties’ arguments
                    on the Market Impact Evidence in the present case (see, in particular, <a href="#p1_126">[126]</a> and <a href="#p1_134">[134]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Finally, we should also emphasise that, in
                    using Market Impact Evidence as one of the factors, care should be taken not to
                    draw false equivalences between the information subsequently released into the
                    market on the one hand and the alleged inside information on the other. In our
                    case, for example, Lew knew that: (a) WBL had forecasted a loss of either
                    $0.4m or $2.3m, depending on what financial data was included; (b) it was
                    very likely that WBL would take a significant impairment charge on WPT in
                    3Q FY07; and (c) it was very likely that WBL would suffer a
                    significant overall loss in 3Q FY07. Such information was <em>not</em> equivalent to the information that was actually
                    released on 14 August 2007, <em>ie</em>, that WBL
                        <em>had in fact</em> suffered an overall loss of
                    $27.3m, of which $26.6m consisted of an impairment charge on WPT (and thus, the
                    actual loss was $0.7m, compared to the forecasted loss of either $0.4m or
                    $2.3m). When considering Market Impact Evidence, the court must be sensitive,
                    both in this case as well as in future cases, to the fact that the quality of
                    the information released (thereby generating the Market Impact Evidence) is
                    usually couched <em>in terms of factual events that have already
                        taken place</em>, whilst the information possessed by the alleged
                    insider trader at the <em>material time</em> may be couched
                    in terms of <em>probabilit</em>y, even if the probability
                    is high (as in the instant case).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the TSC test to the Information Lew
                possessed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The Judge held that both the Loss Forecast
                    and the Significant Impairment Prospect – and therefore, by definition,
                    the Significant Overall Loss Forecast too – were material. We had some
                    reservations with regard to the materiality of the Loss Forecast <em>in itself</em>, which we articulate below for the purpose of
                    giving direction to parties conducting future cases, but we ultimately found
                    there to be sufficient evidence that the Judge was correct on both counts. In
                    any case, the materiality of the Significant Impairment Prospect was sufficient,
                    in and of itself, to render Lew’s sale of 90,000 of his WBL shares a
                    contravention of s 218 of the SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i) The Loss Forecast </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The reason we had some reservations as to
                    whether the Loss Forecast was likely to have influenced the Common Investor was
                    because of three factors <em>taken </em><em>in combination</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     the fact that the Loss Forecast
                        projected only a loss of $0.4m (including M-Flex’s and MFS’s
                        forecasted performance);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     the relativity of this figure to the last reported
                        profit of $1.6 million for 2Q FY07 (<em>ie</em>, only a small profit); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     the fact that the Loss Forecast was a <em>quarterly</em> loss forecast, and, in this regard, it is
                        questionable whether sophisticated investors of the kind intended to be
                        captured by the Common Investor test assess their investments on a quarterly
                        basis rather than on a more long-term basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Factors (a) and (b) above are
                    self-explanatory. In so far as factor (c) is concerned, this revealed the
                    gaps in the <em>Chua Seng Huat</em> definition of the
                    Common Investor (see above at <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a>).
                    The <em>Chua Seng Huat</em> definition only addresses the
                    level of knowledge and skill which the Common Investor is assumed to have. This
                    leaves out the dimension that investors, even of comparative levels of
                    knowledge, may have different risk appetites or investment horizons time-wise.
                        <em>Sauer</em> (at p 325) distinguishes between
                    holders of a small amount of a company’s securities on the one hand and
                    its institutional investors on the other, who have different priorities and thus
                    react differently to particular corporate developments. We find it necessary,
                    therefore, to clarify this aspect of the Common Investor test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In our view, the Common Investor test
                    excludes speculators. The fact that the <em>Chua Seng</em>
                    Huat definition of the “Common Investor” excludes buyers and
                    sellers of shares who are “<em>out to make a quick
                        profit</em> … and would not bother about <em>the
                        matters or factors which prompt an investor</em> to buy or sell shares
                    and when to do so” [emphasis added] (<em>Chua Seng
                        Huat</em> at 328A-B) suggests that this ought to be the case. It
                    is also important for policy reasons to exclude speculators from the materiality
                    test. Virtually any information is capable of influencing the behaviour of
                    people dealing in shares for short-term capital gains, but the court must be
                    careful not to cast the net of materiality too wide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Returning to the facts of the instant case,
                    we had some reservations as to how much Common Investors, as opposed to mere
                    speculators, would be likely to be influenced by a quarterly forecast <em>in isolation</em>, especially one that forecast a loss which
                    was as small as $0.4m. It seemed to us at least questionable whether longer-term
                    investors, who would usually have already done their homework as regards the
                    long-term value of the company whose shares they are interested in, are likely
                    to reassess every quarter whether they should buy or sell the company’s
                    shares, especially when the information pertaining to that quarter comprises
                    merely forecasts. Ideally, we would have liked to have seen more evidence
                    adduced with regard to investor behaviour in this regard. Unfortunately, this
                    was an unexplored dimension because the nature of the expert evidence adduced
                    was confined to Market Impact Evidence. In future cases, this problem may be
                    avoided if parties adduce expert evidence of the right sort (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    These observations notwithstanding, we
                    ultimately found that the evidence in this case, on balance, crossed the
                    threshold required in order to demonstrate that the Loss Forecast was material.
                    The <em>TSC</em> test merely requires a substantial
                    likelihood that the disclosure of the Loss Forecast would be viewed by the
                    Common Investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of
                    information made available. The question centred on whether the Information
                        <em>assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the
                        Common Investor</em>; there was no necessity to prove that the Common
                    Investor would actually change his position, for example, from selling WBL
                    shares to buying WBL shares (see above at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>–<a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    We agreed with the Judge (at [93] of the Judgment) that even if we accepted
                    Lew’s submissions that the Loss Forecast was unreliable from a Common
                    Investor’s perspective (which we did not), the fact that the Loss Forecast
                    was unreliable did not have any relevance at this stage. The Common Investor
                    would not know that the forecasts provided by WBL were generally unreliable,
                    unless he could infer from the generally available information that the
                    forecasts provided by WBL’s senior management were unreliable. There was
                    no such generally available information from which such an inference could be
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    We also agreed with the Judge
                        (at [94] of the Judgment) that
                    weight should be given to the fact that the Loss Forecast was based on the most
                    recent financial information of WBL, including the actual financial results for
                    April and May 2007. We agreed with the logic in the expert evidence of Chong
                    that <em>ceteris paribus</em>, the more recent a financial
                    result, the more weight a Common Investor would attach to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The net attributable profit of WBL for the
                    last few quarters prior to 3Q FY07 is as follows (“Q1 FY 06”,
                    for example, refers to the first quarter of the Financial Year of 2006) –

<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen from the above figures, WBL announced a net
                    attributable profit of $58.9m for the whole financial year of 2006. It cannot be
                    that the first loss forecast by WBL (<em>ie</em>, the Loss
                    Forecast), even though it was a small loss of $0.4m, would not have
                    significantly altered the total mix of information which the Common Investor
                    possessed or would not have assumed significance in the Common Investor’s
                    deliberation as to whether to hold, buy or sell WBL shares. The current
                    information which the Common Investor possessed (for example, the announcements
                    by WBL in its financial reports) generally consisted of forward-looking
                    statements that were optimistic about WBL’s future performances. The Loss
                    Forecast would have significantly altered the positive outlook of the totality
                    of the information that the Common Investor possessed. There was a substantial
                    likelihood that the Loss Forecast would have affected the Common
                    Investor’s perception of the value of WBL shares and would have increased
                    the probability of the Common Investor deciding to sell WBL shares. We were
                    therefore of the view that the Loss Forecast assumed <em>actual
                        significance</em> in the Common Investor’s deliberation as to
                    whether to hold, buy or sell WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii) The Significant Impairment Prospect </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    First and foremost, we need to make an
                    important comment on the fact that the bulk of Lew’s case on the
                    materiality of the Significant Impairment Prospect repeated his earlier
                    submissions that the Information was not generally available. This was wrong in
                    law: under s 218 of the SFA, <em>the analysis of materiality
                        proceeds on the premise that the previous element has been
                        fulfilled</em>, ie<em>, on the premise that the
                        Information was not generally available</em>. It is important to
                    clarify this point because courts and litigants have sometimes conflated the two
                    elements. In so far as Lew’s case conflated these two elements, we had to
                    dismiss it once we held that the Information was not generally
                available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Lew’s other argument was that a Common
                    Investor would understand that an impairment charge was not bad news because it
                    was simply “<em>ex post facto</em> recognition of an
                    existing problem”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> However, he did not
                    substantiate this, and the evidence of MAS’s expert that impairment
                    charges “tend to have a very negative impact” on
                        business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> therefore remained
                    unrebutted. Lew’s argument discounted the effect of an impairment charge
                    as a matter of accounting principle inasmuch as an impairment charge was a
                    write-off against the company’s assets and would cause the net total value
                    of the company’s assets to decrease. Even if we agreed with Lew that the
                    quantum of the impairment charge to be taken on WPT had not been decided yet at
                    the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting or at anytime before 4 July 2007 (the date
                    of the Transaction), the value-at-risk had already been identified, at a
                    minimum, to be $22m (excluding freehold land and buildings). An impairment
                    charge (which is recorded as a loss in a company’s profit and loss
                    statements) of this magnitude would clearly have a substantial likelihood of
                    influencing a Common Investor to buy or sell WBL shares, especially when the
                    magnitude of the loss was compared to the amount of total profits in the
                    previous few quarters prior to 3Q FY07 (see <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> above). It was clear that the Significant Overall Loss
                    Forecast, which was based largely on the Significant Impairment Prospect, would
                    similarly have been likely to influence the Common Investor to buy or sell WBL
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the application of the TSC test to the Information </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    For the above reasons, we upheld the
                    Judge’s findings that (i) the Loss Forecast was material,
                    (ii) the Significant Impairment Prospect was material and, cumulatively,
                    (iii) the Significant Overall Loss Forecast was material.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evaluation of the actual Market Impact Evidence in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As already noted above, the test of
                    materiality under s 216 of the SFA is an objective and prospective one,
                        <em>viz</em>, it is based on a reasonable
                    person’s view of how the information in question <em>would</em> be likely to influence the decision-making processes of a
                    Common Investor, as <em>assessed </em><em>at
                        the time of the alleged insider trade</em>. The parties’
                    overwhelming reliance on actual Market Impact Evidence in the context of the
                    present appeal was therefore, with respect, misplaced, particularly in the light
                    of our cautionary note above (at <a href="#p1_109">[109]</a>) that the Information was <em>not</em>
                    equivalent to the information subsequently released into the market. However,
                    given the sheer amount of time that the parties and the Judge devoted to
                    analysis of the actual Market Impact Evidence in the present case, and given
                    that Market Impact Evidence is only (as mentioned above) one factor going
                    towards proving whether the Common Investor test has been fulfilled, we feel it
                    is appropriate to deal briefly with Lew’s arguments that the actual Market
                    Impact Evidence in the present case demonstrated that the fall in WBL’s
                    share price was insignificant, and thus supported Lew’s argument that the
                    Information was not material because the Common Investors had not been
                    influenced by the Information to buy or sell WBL’s shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    We agreed with the Judge that while the
                    actual Market Impact Evidence supported the objective analysis above to the
                    effect that the news of the impairment charge on WPT was material, the Market
                    Impact Evidence relating to the Loss Forecast was “not as strong”
                    (the Judgment at [115]) and even
                    equivocal. However, the actual Market Impact Evidence would, in any case, not
                    prevent us from finding that the Loss Forecast was material under s 216 of
                    the SFA if it would or would be likely to influence a Common Investor to buy or
                    sell WBL shares under the objective analysis.</p>

                    profit warnings. 17 July 2007 was also the date when WBL issued its own
                    profit warning, specifically mentioning the losses of M-Flex, MFS and WPT as
                    reasons for its loss. A profit warning is an announcement made by a company
                    before it releases its financial statements indicating that the profits to be
                    declared will fall short of expected levels.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The profit warnings did not, on their face,
                    appear to have had any material impact on the price of WBL shares during the
                    above period. The biggest change was the drop from $5.00 to $4.92 between 11 and
                    12 July 2007. However, it was difficult to ascertain if the price drop
                    could be attributed <em>solely</em> to M-Flex’s
                    profit warning. On 12 July 2007, WBL also went ex-dividend by
                    8.5 cents. The price of a company’s shares typically decline after
                    they go ex-dividend in order to reflect the fact that the company’s net
                    asset value has declined by the total amount of dividends paid out. MAS argued
                    that the fall in price is not always equivalent to the dividend amount,
                        <em>ie</em>, the 8-cent drop in WBL’s share price
                    between 11 and 12 July 2007 could not be attributed solely to the
                    8.5 cent dividend. MAS argued that 6 cents of the 8-cent drop could be
                    attributed to the profit warning issued by M-Flex because WBL shares had opened
                    at $4.98 on 12 July 2007, down from the day before, and the 2-cent drop
                    already reflected the ex-dividend date. We agreed with the Judge that it could
                    not be assumed that markets operate with perfect rationality and that the trade
                    throughout 12 July 2007 might still be a response to WBL going ex-dividend.
                        <em>It was thus difficult to tell exactly which part of the
                        price drop on 12 July 2007 was attributable to M-Flex’s profit
                        warning, which in turn pithily demonstrates the fundamental problem with
                        relying on Market Impact Evidence that we highlighted above</em>
                        (at [105]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Furthermore, even if we accepted MAS’s
                    best case, a decrease of 6 cents from $5.00 was only a 1.2% decrease. Even
                    if we took into account the fact that the Straits Times Index
                    (“STI”) was rising by 0.8% at the time, as MAS submitted, the net
                    decrease in WBL’s share price relative to the STI was 2%. This was a
                    relatively small percentage and, coupled with the fact that WBL shares were
                    inactively traded (which meant that the effect of any trade would be magnified
                    relative to an actively traded counter), a decrease of 2% was too insignificant
                    to constitute evidence that M-Flex’s profit warning was
                material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Finally, if we accept the evidence of
                    MAS’s own expert witness that the effect of a piece of news should
                    generally be assessed by looking at the movements in share prices over three
                    days (<em>ie</em>, from 12 to 16 July 2007, because
                    there was no trade on 14 and 15 July 2007), WBL’s share price had
                    gone up to $4.98 by 16 July 2007, a negligible difference from the
                    “original” share price of $5.00 on 11 July
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Both parties agreed that MFS’s and
                    WBL’s profit warnings released on 17 July 2007 did not have any
                    significant impact on the market. Overall, we agreed with the Judge
                        (at [110] of the Judgment)
                    that the market did not appear to have regarded the information on the possible
                    loss suffered by WBL as a significant factor contributing towards its evaluation
                    of WBL’s prospects.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The drop of 10 cents in WBL’s share price on 16 August

                    they were willing to buy WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In so far as MAS’s first argument is
                    concerned, Lew did not challenge Chong’s demonstration of the relationship
                    between WBL’s share prices and the STI. Instead, Lew contended that it was
                    fallacious to correlate the two in the first place because WBL shares were not a
                    component stock of the STI and Chong had provided no explanation as to why they
                    should be correlated. We found Lew’s argument weak because Chong did in
                    fact explain that there was a correlation between the STI and every stock
                        (<em>including non</em>-component stocks), and neither
                    Lew nor his expert witness rebutted this explanation. In fact, both Lew and his
                    expert witness (whose testimony Lew, revealingly, preferred not to rely on in
                    this appeal) relied upon the STI’s movements to explain the movements in
                    WBL’s share prices. We therefore accepted Chong’s evidence that the
                    negative correlation of WBL’s share prices to the STI after the news of
                    the impairment charge on WPT was released demonstrated that the news had a
                    material effect on the price of WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In so far as MAS’s second argument is
                    concerned, Lew’s rebuttals were also unpersuasive. Lew had argued that one
                    could not rely on the Bid-Ask spread during the four trading days after
                    15 August 2007 (“the material Bid-Ask spread”) because the
                    fact that prospective buyers placed lower bids for WBL shares only took into
                    account the demand side of the equation, but not the perspective that
                    prospective sellers had not reduced their asking prices. However, s 216
                    only requires that the information in question would be likely to influence the
                    Common Investor to buy <em>or</em> sell shares. Hence, if
                    Lew accepted that the prospective buyers were influenced to buy WBL shares at
                    lower prices, the material Bid-Ask spread would have satisfied s 216 of the
                    SFA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Lew’s other argument was that the
                    bidders in the material Bid-Ask spread should be excluded because their bidding
                    behaviour demonstrated that they “[did] not necessarily represent Common
                    Investors” but “more likely … represent[ed]
                        opportunists”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The problem with such an
                    argument is that it requires the court to examine bidding patterns in minute
                    detail and to guess at the knowledge level and the motives of individual
                    bidders. Lew’s analysis included the numbers of bidders each day, how many
                    of them deleted their orders and when the orders were deleted, <em>etc</em>. This seemed to us to constitute a (wholly)
                    dangerously speculative exercise. Indeed, Lew himself clearly felt unable to
                    pitch his argument at anything higher than the submission that the bidders in
                    the material Bid-Ask spread were “more likely to represent
                    opportunists” instead of Common Investors. In any case, the Judge
                    observed that many of the deleted bids were instantaneously followed by higher
                    bids, which suggested that the bidders were slowly trying to close the material
                    Bid-Ask spread. That, presumably, was more indicative of the bidders being
                    serious bidders as opposed to pure speculators who were merely trying to see
                    what were the best deals they could obtain from low bids. We agreed with the
                    Judge on this point, although <em>we reiterate that this once
                        again demonstrates how placing undue weight on Market Impact Evidence unduly
                        undermines the objective TSC test</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>–<a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    While WBL’s share price did not fall
                    significantly on 16 August 2007, it had fallen to $4.46 by 22 and
                    23 August 2007. Lew challenged the length of this timeframe, considering
                    that MAS’s expert witness himself had testified that a general timeframe
                    for assessing the impact of a piece of news on the market was three days. We
                    were of the view that there could not be any fixed timeframe for assessing the
                    impact of a piece of news on the market. Much would depend on the nature of the
                    shares and, in this case, since WBL was inactively traded, a reasonable period
                    of time (similar to what is suggested in s 215(<em>b</em>)) must be given for Common Investors to react to the news. We
                    agreed with the Judge (at [112] of
                    the Judgment) that it was significant that substantial volumes of WBL shares
                    (45,000 and 69,000 shares on 22 and 23 August 2007 respectively) were
                    traded only at the price of $4.46, compared to the earlier volume of 6,000 WBL
                    shares traded at the price of $4.68 on 21 August 2007 – this
                    suggested that the price at which the market valued WBL shares was $4.46 after
                    absorbing the information of WBL’s loss and the impairment charge on WPT.
                    It should also be noted that Chong’s correlation table demonstrated that
                    the divergence between WBL’s share price and the STI continued at least
                    until 29 August 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In summary, the difficulty in the
                    interpretation of how the market reacted to the information released by WBL
                    highlighted the difficulties of relying on Market Impact Evidence to assess
                    materiality. However, we agreed with the Judge that the Market Impact Evidence
                    in the present case did support her finding that the information which Lew had
                    with regard to the impairment charge on WPT would cause a reasonable person to
                    expect the impairment charge to have a material effect on the value or price of
                    WBL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 3: Materiality </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In the circumstances, we were therefore of
                    the view that the Information satisfied the requirement of materiality under
                    s 218 of the SFA, as defined by s 216.</p>

                know”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The fourth limb under s 218 of the SFA
                    is in s 218(1)(<em>b</em>), which requires
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the connected person <em>knows</em> or <em>ought reasonably to
                            know</em> that —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    the information is not generally available;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   if it were generally available, it might have
                                a material effect on the price or value of [the] securities of [the]
                                corporation [in question] …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience of exposition, we refer to these as “the
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>
                    elements” of s 218. The <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> elements thus have both subjective as well as
                    objective limbs. Further, s 218(4) of the SFA provides that the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> of knowledge is
                        <em>presumed</em> once it is proved that: (a) the
                    alleged insider trader was in possession of information concerning the company
                    to which he was connected; and (b) such information was not generally
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The Judge did not elaborate on how the
                    objective <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>
                    limb of s 218(1)(<em>b</em>) (<em>ie</em>, the “ought reasonably to know” limb) should be
                    interpreted. In this regard, we are of the view that the interpretation
                    proffered in <em>R v Rivkin</em> with regard to the
                    equivalent Australian legislation ought to be adopted. In <em>R v
                        Rivkin</em>, the court held (at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>) that the “ought reasonably to know” limb
                    “remain[ed] one that [was] <em>subjective</em> to
                    the [person], having regard to all of the relevant circumstances, including the
                    [person’s] mental state at the time” [emphasis added] (“the
                        <em>Rivkin</em> test”). Hence, in examining the
                    issue of whether the alleged insider trader knew or ought reasonably to have
                    known that the information in question was not generally available, the court
                    concerned should first consider if a reasonable person would consider the
                    information not to be generally available. If so, consideration would then be
                    given to the alleged insider trader’s circumstances (including his or her
                    mental state, experience and level of commercial expertise) in order to
                    determine if there are <em>subjective</em> factors which
                    would prevent him from arriving at the same conclusion. This analysis applies to
                    both s 218(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) (<em>ie</em>, <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> with regard to general availability of the information) and
                        s 218(1)(<em>b</em>)(ii) (<em>ie</em>, <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> that the information might have a material effect)
                    (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue 4(a): Did Lew know or ought he reasonably to have known

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Lew attempted to argue that his admissions
                    that the Information was not generally available were not admissions with regard
                    to how the phrase “generally available” was understood in a legal
                    sense under s 215 of the SFA. However, it was clearly within the
                    court’s purview to infer from his statements whether his admissions
                    satisfied how “generally available” was understood in a legal
                    sense under s 215 of the SFA. In the circumstances, we upheld the
                    Judge’s finding that Lew knew the Information was not generally
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue 4(b): Did Lew know or ought he reasonably to have known

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> element under Issue 4(b)
                    was more easily satisfied in the context of the present appeal. The plain
                    language of “<em>might</em> have a material
                    effect” [emphasis added] in s 218(4) indicated that Parliament
                    intended that the threshold for materiality in this context should be pitched at
                    a lower standard than the threshold for materiality under s 216 of the SFA
                        (<em>vis-à-vis</em> Issue 3). Under s 218(4),
                    once the alleged insider trader is proved to be in possession of information
                    concerning the company to which he is connected and once such information is
                    proved to be not generally available, it is presumed that the alleged insider
                    trader (here, Lew) knew that the information <em>might</em>
                    have a material effect on the price or value of the company’s shares.
                    Given how low a threshold the word “might” represents, it is
                    difficult to envision what Parliament requires an alleged insider trader to
                    prove in order to successfully rebut such a presumption. Indeed, short of a
                    subjective circumstance under the <em>Rivkin</em> test, a
                    successful rebuttal of the presumption would be quite extraordinary. It is
                    important that the presumption of knowledge under s 218(4) (which only
                    applies to “connected persons” – see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) must be applied carefully in order that the
                    s 218 insider trading regime is not more onerous for corporate insiders
                    than Parliament originally intended.</p>

                        without relying on the presumption of knowledge under </em><em>s 218(4)</em>, there was sufficient evidence to
                    demonstrate that Lew knew or reasonably ought to have known that the
                    Information, if generally available, <em>might</em> have a
                    material effect on the price or value of WBL shares. First, Lew acknowledged
                    during cross-examination that one danger of internal forecasts being leaked to
                    the public before they were finalised was that people might trade on the basis
                    of that information. This clearly suggested that such information <em>might</em> be material. Secondly, it is undisputed that Lew
                    had a conversation with Swee Hong about the price-sensitivity of the Information
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). Lew did not
                    dispute that Swee Hong expressed her opinion that the Information was
                    price-sensitive. The opinion of WBL’s Head of Legal and Compliance should
                    surely have put Lew on constructive notice that, at the very least, the
                    Information <em>might</em> be material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    While the Judge’s ultimate findings
                    with regard to the <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> elements were correct, we would, with respect, clarify part
                    of the Judge’s basis for finding that Lew possessed the requisite
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em>. At
                        [126] of the Judgment, the Judge
                    held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While it may be fairly said that WPT’s troubles were publicly
                        well-documented, <em>the [C]ommon </em><em>[I]nvestor would not have known that</em> a conditional
                        deadline to impair had been imposed by the AC [Audit Committee],
                        and that the condition had, in all likelihood, not been satisfied as of the
                        2 July 2007 GMC Meeting (and after the deadline imposed). <em>Therefore, while the [C]ommon </em><em>[I]nvestor may suspect that an impairment would be taken at some point
                            of time, the news that an impairment would be immediately recognised
                            must surely have a possible impact on WBL share price.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge further observed, in a similar vein, as follows
                        (at [128]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lew had information of a better quality than the market. The information
                        related to significant impairments and a forecasted loss after six quarters
                        of consecutive profit. <em>The market did not know that the
                            impairment or loss was to be recorded. Lew therefore ought reasonably to
                            know</em> that the information might have a material effect on the
                        price of the share. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The Judge’s reasoning as set out in
                    the preceding paragraph was the same as the reasoning which she adopted
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> her earlier finding that the
                    Information was not generally available. The logic was that <em>because</em> the market did not yet know about the impairment charge
                    on WPT or WBL’s loss, it <em>therefore</em> follows
                    that news of these developments must have been material. With respect, this
                        <em>conflates</em> the element of general availability
                    with the element of Lew’s <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> as to the materiality of the
                Information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In summary, these were our <em>main holdings</em> in the present appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_146-p2_a"></a>(a)     In so far as <em>Issue 1</em> was concerned (<em>ie</em>, what information about WBL Lew possessed at the material
                        time (which we defined at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> as
                        “the Information”)), we agreed with the Judge that the
                        Information consisted of the following pieces of information: (i) the
                        Loss Forecast, (ii) the Significant Impairment and (iii) the
                        Significant Overall Loss Forecast (all as defined above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). This was consistent with the fact that
                        “information” in s 214 of the SFA was intended to be
                        interpreted more widely (see the analysis above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> – <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In the circumstances, Lew
                        was wrong to raise the <em>certainty</em> and <em>reliability</em> of the information which he acquired
                        from the 2 July 2007 GMC Meeting to argue that the information
                        therefore did not constitute “information” within the meaning
                        of s 218. The certainty and reliability of information was only
                        relevant to the inquiry under Issues 2 and 3. Issue 1, on the
                        other hand, relates to the very broad and general question as to <em>what</em> constitutes “information” in the
                        first place, not the <em>quality</em> of the
                        information and information might include knowledge of an uncertain,
                        predictive or speculative nature. It was also important to specifically
                            <em>particularise</em> the Information (see above
                            at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> – <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>) to proceed with the inquiry under Issues 2 and 3,
                        especially with regard to Issue 2, specifically and especially when it
                        is disputed whether the Information could be <em>deduced</em> from information that was already generally
                        available. Nevertheless, as the parties had joined issue on the question of
                        certainty and (especially) reliability at this (albeit inappropriate)
                        threshold stage, we found, on the facts, that the Information was, in any
                        event and in fact, both certain and reliable (see the analysis above,
                        especially at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> – <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_146-p2_b"></a>(b)     In so far as <em>Issue 2</em>
                        was concerned (<em>ie</em>, whether the Information was
                        “generally available” under s 215 of the SFA), we agreed
                        with the Judge that the Information was <em>not</em>
                        generally available under the respective limbs of s 215 of the SFA,
                        especially under s 215(<em>c</em>) of the SFA.
                        Furthermore, we agreed that the Judge had applied the correct legal test as
                        embodied in <em>R v Hannes</em> in relation to
                            s 215(<em>c</em>) of the SFA, <em>ie</em>, information would only qualify as
                        “generally available” under s 215(<em>c</em>) if the Common Investor could make deductions, conclusions
                        or inferences from information which were of the “same
                        character” or “quality” as the information the insider
                        possessed. However, we differed from the Judge in so far as she failed to
                        state <em>exactly who</em> was contemplated in
                            s 215(<em>c</em>) as making the
                        “deductions, inferences and conclusions” from the Generally
                        Available Information on WBL (as defined at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above) for the purposes of s 215(<em>c</em>) (see above at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>). A <em>consistent and
                            objective</em> point of reference must be identified, and this
                        point of reference is <em>from the perspective of the Common
                            Investor</em> as defined at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above. To determine what information is generally
                        available in the market, it must be determined what “deductions,
                        conclusions, or inferences” as referred to in s 215(<em>c</em>) could have been made by a Common Investor. We
                        agreed with the Judge that the Generally Available Information on WBL that
                        Lew relied on was too weak for the Common Investor to have drawn the
                        deductions, conclusions or inferences that would have enabled him or her to
                        arrive at the same content as that contained in the Information. There was
                        no basis in the Generally Available Information on WBL for the Common
                        Investor to deduce that WBL was going to take an impairment charge on WPT in
                        3Q FY07 and, even if such an impairment could be deduced, the Common
                        Investor could not from the Generally Available Information on WBL deduce
                        the quantum of the impairment charge. Further, even if the Common Investor
                        could have arrived at the same conclusions as those in the Information, they
                        did not meet the necessary threshold of being of the “same
                        character” or “quality” as the Information as
                        particularised at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above: the
                        Information was based on actual financial results in April and May 2007 as
                        well as actual knowledge of the board’s discussion of an impairment
                        charge (and, importantly, its quantum) on WPT. Therefore, the Information
                        was not “generally available” under s 218 of the SFA (see
                        generally above at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> – <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_146-p2_c"></a>(c)     In so far as <em>Issue 3</em>
                        was concerned (<em>ie</em>, whether, if the Information
                            <em>were</em> generally available, a reasonable
                        person would expect the Information to have a “material
                        effect” on the price or value of WBL shares under s 216 of the
                        SFA), we agreed with the Judge that the correct legal test was the <em>TSC</em> test as defined at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above. Indeed, parties did not dispute that the
                            <em>TSC</em> test is the correct test to apply
                        under Issue 3. Rather, parties disputed how much weight should be
                        accorded to Market Impact Evidence (as defined in <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> above), with Lew, in particular, arguing that Market
                        Impact Evidence should be treated as <em>conclusive</em> in demonstrating whether the Information was
                        material or not. For the reasons given at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> – <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> above, we rejected this approach and held that, whilst
                        Market Impact Evidence may be a <em>relevant</em>
                        factor in determining whether the Information was material, it is clearly
                        not conclusive in and of itself given s 216 of the SFA and the
                            <em>TSC</em> test. The proper role of expert
                        evidence, in the context of s 216 of the SFA, should be to assist the
                        court in establishing how <em>a reasonable person, at the
                            time of the alleged insider trade</em>, would have expected the
                        information to influence a Common Investor, and <em>not</em> to analyse in minute detail what, on hindsight, had
                        actually happened to the market upon the release of the
                        information.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Further, we held that the Information here was
                        material within the meaning of s 216 of the SFA (<em>ie</em>, a reasonable person would have expected the Information
                        to have a “material effect” on the price or value of WBL
                        shares) because there was a substantial likelihood that the Information
                        would have influenced the Common Investor to buy or sell WBL shares. While
                        we had some reservations with regard to the materiality of the Loss Forecast
                            <em>in and of itself</em>, this was not crucial
                        since we agreed that the Significant Impairment Prospective and therefore
                        the Significant Overall Loss Forecast were material. The Market Impact
                        Evidence in this case supported the conclusion that there was a substantial
                        likelihood that the Information would have influenced the Common Investor to
                        buy or sell WBL shares, although, as we held earlier, Market Impact Evidence
                        is <em>not conclusive proof</em> of materiality under
                        s 216. Therefore, the Information satisfied the requirement under
                        s 218 of materiality (see the analysis above, especially
                            at <a href="#p1_110">[110]</a> – <a href="#p1_137">[137]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_146-p2_d"></a>(d)     In so far as <em>Issue 4</em>
                        was concerned (<em>ie</em>, whether Lew knew the
                        Information was not “generally available” and that if the
                        Information were generally available, it might have a “material
                        effect” on the price or value of WBL shares), we found that this was
                        a clear case where, even without relying on the presumption of knowledge
                        under s 218(4) of the SFA, there was sufficient evidence, on a balance
                        of probabilities, to find that Lew <em>knew</em> the
                        Information was not generally available, and if generally available, might
                        have a material effect on the price or value of WBL shares. Therefore, we
                        upheld the Judge’s findings regarding Lew’s
                    knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    For the reasons set out above, we were
                    satisfied that all the elements of insider trading pursuant to s 218 of the
                    SFA had been established and that Lew was in contravention of the said
                    provision. We therefore dismissed Lew’s appeal with costs and the usual
                    consequential orders.</p>
