Further, the bruises over his lower back and anterior abdomen were not typical locations of bruises sustained following an accidental fall. In cross-examination at trial, Dr Tan testified that if Izz had indeed fallen on a flat surface as the accused claimed, then such a fall would not have caused the three discrete well-defined bruises he observed on Izz’s forehead: instead, such a fall would usually cause one or two poorly-defined bruises.

On 5 October 2019, Izz was brought by his mother for review of a bruise over his left cheek which she had noticed the day before.

The accused studied Marine Engineering at a local polytechnic, but dropped out due to financial constraints. In October 2010, he was first seen at IMH when he felt stressed after breaking up with his girlfriend. He was assessed to have no mental illness. He did not complete his National Service, having been medically downgraded and discharged on psychiatric grounds. He was referred to IMH in December 2010, and again in January 2011 by the SAF Medical Officer, for having suicidal and homicidal thoughts: he was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. During his interviews with Dr Cheow, however, he told the latter that he had “actually lied about being suicidal and having homicidal thoughts towards others during his national service, as he was simply unwilling to serve in the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces)”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The accused’s next visit to IMH was in December 2015. He was brought there by the police following a quarrel with his fiancée. On that occasion, his father had tried to intervene, which led to his becoming more agitated and allegedly injuring his father’s finger “accidentally”. He was diagnosed with an “acute stress reaction” and with “anger management issues”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Prior to the 7 November 2019 incident involving Izz, the accused’s last visit to IMH was in July 2017. This was for the purpose of a medical report, as he had been referred to IMH by the Child Protection Services (“CPS”). His then fiancée (whom he later married and then divorced) had reported being physically assaulted by him, and had also reported that he had “pinched and verbally threatened” their son. In the IMH report, the accused was noted to have been sarcastic towards the psychiatrist and to be easily provoked. He was assessed as not meeting the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder. However, the report noted that he had personality traits such as being prone to anger outbursts and making suicidal/homicidal threats, and that these behaviours were pervasive and causing distress to others”. Psychotherapy for anger management was recommended, but the accused “did not see any problem with his behaviour and did not see the need for intervention”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In his report, Dr Cheow documented the account – or more accurately, <span class="font-italic">accounts</span> - of events which the accused had related to him regarding the night when Izz died. According to the initial account given, the accused had left Izz in the back of the van while he visited the nearby supermarket to buy towels and wet wipes. On returning to the van, he was packing the “baby stuff” when Izz started crying. He reported feeling “uncomfortable” due to “the baby constantly interrupting him” – although he denied feeling “disturbed” by the crying as he felt that it “would sound incriminating if he admitted to being ‘disturbed by the crying’”. At this point, Izz was “in a crawling position”. The accused “proceeded to push [Izz’s head against the plywood floor of the van”, using what he described to Dr Cheow as “mild force”. He then placed Izz in a sitting position. When Izz continued crying, he “pushed [Izz’s] head against the floor once again from this position”. Subsequently he tried to feed Izz, but Izz refused the milk; and he noticed bleeding from Izz’s gums. As his father was not keen on letting him bring Izz home, he contacted Nadiah instead in order to return Izz to her. Nadiah noticed bruises on Izz’s forehead when she met up with him, but he told her that Izz had fallen down. At this time, Izz "appeared OK”. It was only an hour later that he and Nadiah realised Izz was “not responsive” and not well”, whereupon they decided to bring him to NUH.

He claimed that the account he had previously provided “was as per the SOF”, but that he had “said the wrong thing” as he was in a “state of panic”, allegedly as a result of “coercive interrogation techniques” used by the police. The accused’s subsequent, altered account of events ran as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When [the accused] returned to the van after visiting the nearby supermarket, he saw the baby fall down and hit its head against the plywood floor of the van. He stated that he then placed the baby in a sitting position. The baby kept crying as he packed the “baby stuff” so he claimed that he was actually trying to soothe the baby by patting the baby’s neck but may have accidentally ended up pushing the baby forward instead. He further claimed that he did not use much force but the baby might have already been weakened from the previous fall. He told “Nadia” (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) and the NUH doctors that the baby had fallen out of his arms though as he did not think they would believe him if he told them that the baby had fallen down on its own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Dr Cheow’s assessment was that the accused had “impulsive personality traits characterised by being prone to anger outbursts with a propensity to react with violent or suicidal threats”. In his report, Dr Cheow stated that despite the accused’s denial of past physical violence, his then-fiancée had reported physical assaults on herself and her son by the accused.

</div> There was also a fracture of the lateral third of the left clavicle. In Dr Lau’s opinion, the cause of death was traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, which “would be consistent with the infliction of blunt force trauma to the head and face”. Further, a number of the external and internal injuries – namely, the facial abrasions and bruises, the laceration of the frenulum with surrounding mucosal bruising, and the fractured left clavicle – were, in Dr Lau’s opinion, “highly suspicious of non-accident injury”.

</div> In cross-examination, Dr Lau was asked about Nadiah’s evidence that a few days before 7 November 2019, Izz had fallen face downwards” and injured his “upper lip” while crawling. His evidence was that he found this “completely inconsistent” with the nature of the injury to the frenulum which he had observed, as the injury to the frenulum “would require quite a bit of force”– whereas if Izz had fallen “face downwards” while crawling, the distance that his head would have travelled to the floor “wouldn’t have been very high”, and the first point of contact “would likely have been the chin rather than the upper lip”. In response to Defence counsel’s assertion that both the accused and Nadiah had observed “a swell on [Izz’s] upper lip on the 7th of November”, Dr Lau stated that while that might have been the case, such a “swell” was “quite different from a laceration of the frenulum”, which was of a “completely different order or magnitude altogether”.

However, he stressed that the healing of bone injuries was very variable; that one had to be “very careful about ageing these injuries”; and that while the fracture seemed to be a fresh injury at the time of the autopsy, he was unable to say categorically that it “could not have been sustained or inflicted a day or two or some day before the fatal injuries were inflicted or sustained”.

</div> Dr Lau stated that insofar as he had documented finding “faint bruises” on Izz, these faint bruises could not be old injuries, as none of the bruises showed the sort of yellowish discoloration that would have suggested they were probably more than 18 hours old. Indeed, the fact that the bruises were faint could suggest that they had not developed fully before the child died.

His evidence was that if the assailant were indeed a full-grown adult, then one had to recognize the existence of “a stark asymmetry…between a defenceless 9.5-month-old infant and a full grown adult”: “what might have been mild or moderate force on the part of the assailant could amount to moderate to severe force as experienced by the child”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In general, with regard to the versions which recounted an accidental fall of some sort, Dr Lau noted that there was a total lack of the sort of linear abrasions and lacerations that would have been expected from a fall in which the child had allegedly come into contact with the edge of the floorboard or the footstep. Instead, the abrasions found on Izz were all non-linear, and no laceration was found.

</div> Dr Lau also expressed doubt about the accused’s claim that Izz had “bounced” off the wooden floorboard of the van, given that the head is a solid non-spherical structure and the floor of the van is a firm unyielding surface.

</div> In Dr Lau’s opinion, the version of events in which Izz had fallen headfirst onto the van floorboard before “bouncing” off it would be the least compelling version. In contrast, in Dr Lau's opinion, the version of events in which Izz’s head had been pushed twice against the floorboard was the most compelling version and would explain the occurrence of many of the external and internal injuries to the scalp. Dr Lau testified that taken together, both acts of pushing would have caused the two haemorrhages. In his view, there would have been at least two distinct or discrete blows to the head: one to the front of the head and one to the left side of the head.

</div> He denied having been “unfriendly” towards the accused or having stated that he did not believe the accused’s version of an accidental fall. Instead, according to Insp Daniel Lim, he had spent the initial part of the interview trying to build rapport by asking the accused “about his job, et cetera”. At this point, the conversation was in English, as Insp Lim had been told that the accused could speak English. However, as he started going into the “interview proper”, he noticed that the accused was becoming “rather evasive”, especially when asked about things such as timing and sequence which did not seem right – and it was at this point that the accused started asking Insp Lim questions in Malay. As he found it difficult to carry on the conversation, Insp Lim informed the IO ASP Ang that he “might not be the right person to interview [the accused]”; and he was told that another officer would take over the interview. After this, Insp Lim had “more casual” conversation with the accused, which had nothing to do with the case.

However, when he was interviewed by ASP Ang at 4.30 pm on 11 November 2019, he “decided to come back to [his] original version” of the accidental fall because ASP Ang was “not threatening" him. The accused claimed that when ASP Ang concluded the statement-recording, he walked out of the room, leaving the accused alone with the interpreter Mdm Sapiahtun. When ASP Ang returned to the interview room, he brought the accused out of the room and handed him over to “four to five police officers”. The accused was then taken to another interview room on the 14th or 16th floor, where he was questioned by Insp Daniel Lim “many times”. When he told Insp Daniel Lim that the accused had “accidentally” fallen from his arm, the latter appeared “unhappy”. At this point, the accused and Insp Daniel Lim were seated “facing each other”; and Insp Lim was holding a “Dasani water bottle filled with water”, while “four to five police officers” stood behind Insp Lim “observing” the interview. The accused claimed that Insp Lim threw the bottle of water at his cheek, then came and sat next to him, pointed a finger “on [his] neck”, and said: “You better be remorseful, or I buy you a rope”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Following the above incident, the accused was brought back to his cell in the lock-up area. By this point, both SSI Mazlan’s threat and Insp Daniel Lim’s threat were “playing on [his] mind”. The following day (12 November 2019), when he was interviewed again by ASP Ang at 10.45 a.m., he “decided to give [the] imaginary story” about pushing Izz’s head towards the van floorboard.

When asked by his counsel to explain why he had taken such a long time to bring up the alleged threats, the accused said that it was because these threats “were still playing on [his] mind”; and he also did not know at the time that the words uttered by SSI Mazlan and Insp Daniel Lim constituted threats.

The determination of voluntariness is a two-stage factual inquiry, comprising an objective and a subjective limb: <span class="font-italic">per </span>the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 (“<span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin</span>”) at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman bin Jumari</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 557 (“<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span>”) at [39]. The first stage entails an objective consideration of whether there was a threat, inducement or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person. The second stage of the test of voluntariness is a subjective consideration of whether the inducement, threat or promise operates on the mind of the accused person through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: in other words, whether the said inducement, threat or promise was such that it would be reasonable for the accused to think that he would gain some advantage or avoid any adverse consequences in relation to the proceedings against him (<span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin </span>at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily: <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman </span>at [36]. That being said, it need not be shown that all doubt of influence or fear had been removed from the accused’s mind before an attempt was made to record his confessions. Rather, the trial judge need only consider whether the evidence of the accused alleging inducements, threats, promises or assaults, taken together with the prosecution’s evidence, has raised a reasonable doubt in his mind that the accused was thus influenced into making the statement (<span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin </span>at [53], <span class="font-italic">Panya Marmontree and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The submissions made by the Prosecution and the Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The Prosecution submitted that the objective limb of the two-stage test was not met for the alleged 8 November 2019 threat and the alleged 11 November 2019 threats as these threats “never took place”.

</div> The Prosecution also submitted that even if there had been a threat made by SSI Mazlan on 8 November 2019, the subjective limb of the two-stage test would still not be met because the evidence showed that at 4.30 p.m. on 11 November 2019, the accused was still capable of giving a statement containing his initial story of an accidental fall.

</div> Moreover, the accused’s response to the alleged 8 November 2019 threat and the alleged 11 November 2019 threat did not make sense. The accused’s evidence was that he understood both SSI Mazlan and Insp Daniel Lim to have told him that he needed to change his statement from the original (and supposedly true) version of an accidental fall to a version that would allow him to avoid the death penalty. If that were indeed the case, then it made no sense for him to have changed his version of events to a “more serious” version which amounted to a “confession of intentionally pushing” Izz’s head against the van floorboard.

</div> Sgt Shahrel had no reason to lie about being present in the interview room; and he had in any event a cogent explanation for why he entered the interview room: he was there to take over from ASP Ng, to escort the accused. ASP Ng testified that Sgt Shahrel entered the interview room towards the last 15 minutes of the interview, and that he himself left the room when Sgt Shahrel arrived, as he had to take over the van for the accused’s transport.

In fact, ASP Ng described SSI Mazlan as having spoken to the accused in a professional and courteous manner during the interview. The Defence did not suggest any reason why ASP Ng and/or Sgt Shahrel should have lied to cover up any threats made by SSI Mazlan. I was also satisfied that there could not have been any collusion between these three witnesses: SSI Mazlan, for example, did not even recall Sgt Shahrel being present in the interview room and did not mention him at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In respect of the alleged 11 November 2019 threat, the accused’s allegation about ASP Ang having left the interview room immediately after the conclusion of the statement-recording was refuted not only by ASP Ang himself but also by the Malay interpreter Mdm Sapiahtun, who was certain that ASP Ang had not left her alone in the interview room with the accused at any point in time. There was no reason for Mdm Sapiahtun to lie about this issue.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Further, the accused’s story about having been brought out of the regional lockup area to another room on a higher floor was entirely refuted by the objective evidence of the ESD entries and the unchallenged testimony of Insp Shahril<span class="font-weight-bold">. </span>The relevant ESD entries clearly indicated the accused being escorted to Interview Room 5 at 4.23pm on 11 November 2019 and then being returned to his cell in the lock-up area at 7.28pm on the same day.

</div> – and yet there was no evidence at all in the ESD of such movements. This showed that the accused’s story about being brought to a 14th or 16th floor room and being threatened by Insp Daniel Lim in that room was a pack of lies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As the Prosecution also highlighted in their cross-examination of the accused, the account he gave in the ancillary hearing of the events on 11 November 2019 contradicted the account provided in his Case for the Defence as well as the Further Case for the Defence. Most significantly, the Case for the Defence dated 31 January 2022 had stated that he was first returned to his cell on 11 November 2019 before being brought out again “some time in the night” to “a room”.

</div> This version of events was strikingly dissimilar from the version the accused related in the ancillary hearing, which featured “four to five police officers” coming to Interview Room 5 after the conclusion of his statement-recording, and bringing him from that room directly to another room on the 14th or 16th floor. When asked about the discrepancies, the accused blamed them on his own counsel, claiming that counsel had not only made a mistake in the Case for the Defence but had told him to “just explain to the court” instead.

</div> Tellingly, in his submissions at the close of the ancillary hearing, counsel did not even rely on this testimony by the accused. Instead, counsel sought to suggest that the accused’s own recollection of events might be somewhat imperfect– which suggestion, with respect, was never even made by the accused himself.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Finally, as the Prosecution pointed out, despite having been purportedly “frightened” and “worried” by the threats from SSI Mazlan and Insp Daniel Lim, the accused made no complaints at any point in time – not to any police officer, nor to any interpreter, nor to the doctors who examined him before and after each of his statements – and not even to his own (former) counsel Mr Muzammil. Indeed, it was not disputed that he told his present counsel about the alleged threats only in December 2021 – more than half a year after counsel’s appointment and just a few months before the commencement of the trial. The accused claimed that this was because after “the incident” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Izz’s death) had occurred on 8 November 2019, he was still “grieving the death of Izz” and had a “lot of things running” through his mind: as such, he did not think of complaining to anyone about the alleged threats.

</div> While this might have sounded like a plausible explanation for his failure to make any complaint in the days immediately following Izz’s death, it could not explain his failure to mention the alleged threats to his former counsel Mr Muzammil during the entire time that the latter was representing him. In this connection, as noted earlier, when asked to explain his failure to mention the alleged threats to Mr Muzammil, the accused claimed that it was because the threats had continued “playing on [his] mind”, and he felt he had to “stick to [his] imaginary story”. He added that he also did not know at the time that the words uttered by SSI Mazlan and Insp Lim were threats.

</div> Neither reason made sense. First of all, on the accused’s own evidence, what SSI Mazlan and Insp Lim had communicated to him by their threats was that if he did not change his statement such that he jettisoned his story of an accidental fall, he would be facing the death penalty. However, it was not disputed that by the time the accused came to be represented by Mr Muzammil, he had already been charged with an offence punishable with the death penalty – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the offence of murder. There was thus no reason by that stage for the accused to hold back from telling Mr Muzammil about the threats, since the “evil” allegedly threatened by SSI Mazlan and Insp Lim had already come to pass. Indeed, since the accused claimed that he had told Mr Muzammil that the story about his pushing Izz’s head against the floorboard was “not the true version”,

</div> <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> he could and should have explained to the latter why he had told such a story to the police. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 As for the accused’s assertion that he did not know at the time that the words spoken by the two officers constituted “threats”, I did not see why this purported ignorance of the law should have prevented him from telling Mr Muzammil about the officers’ alleged conduct. Whatever the legal label to be applied to that alleged conduct, the bottom line was that the accused had – on his own evidence – been very “frightened” and “worried” by the things they said; and in Insp Lim’s case, the verbal statements had even been accompanied by physical violence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>throwing a bottle full of water at the accused such that it hit his left cheek). There was every reason for the accused to bring these matters up to his then counsel. The fact that he failed to do so – and had no coherent explanation for his failure to do so – strongly suggested that the alleged 8 November 2019 threat and the alleged 11 November 2019 threat never happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 To sum up on the first limb of the two-stage inquiry into voluntariness, therefore: on the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the alleged 8 November 2019 threat and the alleged 11 November 2019 threat never in fact happened. I was satisfied that neither SSI Mazlan nor Insp Daniel Lim made any threats (or for that matter, any inducements or promises) to the accused on 8 November 2019 and 11 November 2019 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Having made this finding, it was not necessary for me to consider the second stage of the two-stage inquiry into voluntariness. However, in the interests of completeness, I should make it clear that I did consider this second stage; and I was satisfied that even assuming the alleged threats had been made, the Prosecution would in any event also have been able to clear the second stage of the inquiry. As the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span> (at [39] – [40]), this is the subjective limb of the inquiry: at this stage, the court “will consider all the circumstances, including the personality and experience of the accused person, when it decides whether and how any inducement, threat of promise has affected the accused person in the statement-recording process”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In this connection, as the Prosecution pointed out, after purportedly having been told that he would face the death penalty if he did not change his story about an accidental fall, the accused actually changed his story to a much <span class="font-italic">more serious</span> one about <span class="font-italic">pushing</span> Izz’s head against the floorboard of the van. The accused claimed that from his point of view, the original “true” story of an accidental fall was “more serious” than the “imaginary story” about his pushing Izz’s head against the floorboard because the “true” story involved Izz falling three times.

</div> This did not make sense because based on the accused’s own narrative, all three falls were not caused by him and were instead the direct result of Izz having fidgeted while being held in the accused’s arm. The accused claimed that the three falls showed he had been “careless” or “negligent” – but even if that were true, it still did not explain why an “imaginary story” about <span class="font-italic">pushing</span> Izz’s head against the floorboard constituted a “less serious” version of events. After all, based on the accused’s own account, the act of <span class="font-italic">pushing </span>Izz’s head against a firm surface was a conscious act; it was neither an accident nor an act of automatism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In his submissions at the close of the ancillary hearing, Defence counsel urged me to “accept” the accused’s interpretation on the ground that he was a “layperson” with “his own thinking”.

</div> It is true that the subjective limb of the two-stage inquiry into voluntariness calls for the court to consider <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>“the personality and experience of the accused person” in deciding whether and how any inducement, threat or promise has affected him in the statement-recording process (<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman </span>at [40]).

In the present case, defence counsel did not make any arguments about invoking the court’s exclusionary discretion on the basis of some form of unfairness in the statement-recording process. In any event, there was nothing in the evidence to justify the exercise of the court’s discretion to exclude the disputed statements on this separate basis.

In <span class="font-italic">Azlin</span>, the CA held (at [133]) that to establish murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) against the accused persons in that case, the prosecution would have to establish, first, the cause of death – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>death must have been caused by the accused as a result of acts carried out by the accused (in <span class="font-italic">Azlin</span>, the pouring of very hot water on the deceased – their young son – thereby causing severe scalding injuries); second, the intention to cause the injury, which “is a subjective inquiry pursuant to the well-established test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span>”; and third, the consequences of the injury, which is an objective inquiry, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the bodily injury inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In respect of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>required under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the CA has made it clear in numerous cases that it is not necessary for the accused to have known or intended the potentially fatal consequence of inflicting the bodily injury; it is sufficient that the accused intentionally caused the particular bodily injury inflicted (<span class="font-italic">Wang Wanfeng </span>at [33], citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Chee Wee </span>at [42] – [32]). As the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chee Wee </span>put it, s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) “envisions that the accused subjectively intends to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the ordinary course of nature” (at [42]).

Whether a particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has to be determined by the court in the light of the evidence adduced and taking into account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular “minor injury”, to use the term of the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Joo Cheng</span>, which injury would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but, in fact caused a different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, cl (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) would not be attracted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23     It would be different, if the injury caused was clearly intended but the offender did not realise the true extent and consequences of that injury.

According to the accused, the “true version” was that of the accidental fall, as recounted in the Case for the Defence dated 31 January 2022 and in his testimony at trial. The Defence argued that despite having admitted to pushing Izz’s head against the floorboard in the above statements, the accused had also given the police his “accidental fall” version in the statement recorded on 11 November 2019 at 4.30 p.m.: the implication of this argument appeared to be that since the accused had given the police another account which was inconsistent with the account of his act of pushing Izz’s head, the latter must be false, or at least unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Insofar as the accused has given inconsistent versions of events in his statements, the CA has held that where there exist inconsistencies and shortcomings in an accused’s statements (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the statements contain inconsistencies when compared to each other), the trial judge is entitled to rely on such parts of the statements as he thinks can be relied on, and to decide which, if any, of the inconsistent portions represent the truth: <span class="font-italic">Thongbai Naklangdon v PP</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 55 at [47].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I have already explained elsewhere in these written grounds my reasons for finding in favour of the voluntariness and admissibility of those statements on which the accused recounted pushing Izz’s head twice against the van floorboard.

</div> To recapitulate: Dr Lau’s evidence was that a “blunt force injury” usually happened when there had been a “blow with a blunt object including say a fist or an arm that is…applied to the relevant part of the body”, or when that part of the body had been “pushed against a hard surface or object”.

</div> It will also be recalled that in respect of the accounts which narrated an accidental fall of some sort, Dr Lau testified that if the deceased had indeed fallen head down in the manner described by the accused and with sufficient force to have caused the internal injuries to the brain observed in the autopsy, then one would have expected “some laceration or some linear abrasion of the skull” – but no such laceration or linear abrasion was found in the autopsy.

</div> Further, insofar as the accused had recounted an accidental fall involving three points of impact (where Izz had fallen headfirst onto the floorboard, “bounced” off the floorboard, hit the footstep, and then fallen to the ground), Dr Lau stated that he could not see how – if any part of Izz had fallen onto a hard or firm surface such as the van floorboard – it would have “bounced” off that surface. In particular, if Izz had fallen headfirst onto the floorboard, then “logically, instead of bouncing off, what ought to have happened is that the rest of the body should then simply have fallen onto the floorboard itself”, since the head is “a solid structure”, even in a child – and “not a sphere that is filled with air nor…a rubber ball”.

</div> In respect of the laceration of the frenulum of the upper lip, Dr Lau testified that this would constitute a third point of trauma, because in his opinion, this injury “would have been due to a direct blow of some sort to the lips or to the mouth”. I accepted Dr Lau’s testimony on this score, as he was able to explain why he did not think this injury was the result of an accident. In gist, he explained that it was unlikely that the laceration of the frenulum had been caused either in the process of the child being fed milk or through a fall sustained while crawling. The first scenario was unlikely due to the softness of the teat of a milk bottle.

</div> I should add that although the Defence seemed to think that Nadiah’s testimony supported their theory that the laceration of the frenulum occurred when Izz fell on his face while crawling, this was not in fact the case. What Nadiah actually said in cross-examination was that on one occasion, Izz had hit his face “on the floor” while crawling: she had noticed some swelling on his upper lip, but she could not recall when this had occurred,

</div> evidence was also led from Dr Ian Tan of NUH. The account given by the accused to the NUH doctors involved Izz accidentally falling out of the accused’s arm and hitting his forehead on the “edge” of the van before landing “prone” on the concrete car park floor. Dr Tan’s evidence was that this account of the mechanism of injury was not consistent with the three “very discrete, well-defined” bruises found on Izz’s forehead. In Dr Tan’s opinion, if Izz had indeed fallen once on the floorboard and once on the concrete ground (as recounted by the accused at NUH), he would have expected to see two ill-defined bruises instead of the three well-defined bruises observed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 For completeness, I noted that Dr Ian Tan did suggest that the alleged dislocation of Izz’s left shoulder during sleep could be suspicious, as dislocation would usually follow an injury of considerable impact and force. However, Dr Wong’s expert opinion on clavicle fractures in young children appeared to corroborate Nadiah’s testimony as to how Izz’s shoulder injury had occurred; and Dr Lau too testified that the healing time of bone injuries could be variable. In the circumstances, I accepted that the evidence did not appear to show that the left clavicle fracture was sustained as a result of the events of 7 November 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Barring the left clavicle injury, however, the medical and forensic evidence in this case was generally consistent in establishing that Izz’s head and facial injuries were fresh and indicative of <span class="font-italic">non-accidental</span> injury to the head. It must be noted that the Defence did not call any experts of their own to challenge Dr Lau’s evidence. Apart from the issue of the left clavicle injury (on which Dr Lau clarified his position in cross-examination), Dr Lau’s evidence on the non-accidental nature of Izz’s injuries – and his rejection of the “accidental fall” narrative – remained unrefuted at the end of the trial, as was Dr Tan’s rejection of the “accidental fall” story he recorded from the accused.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The evidence of the accused’s conduct subsequent to the incident</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 I next considered the evidence of the accused’s conduct subsequent to the incident at the Yishun MSCP. Preliminarily, s 8(2) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“EA”) makes it clear that the conduct of an accused person subsequent to the alleged offence is relevant – and thus, admissible – evidence in the criminal proceedings against that accused. Having considered the evidence of the accused’s conduct subsequent to the incident, I found this evidence highly useful in shedding light on the issue of whether the accused committed the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of the offence. Essentially, this evidence supported the Prosecution’s case that Izz’s death was caused by an act of the accused and not by an accidental fall.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 In this case, while the Prosecution and the accused disagreed on what exactly happened to Izz at the Yishun MSCP, they were agreed on one thing: there was some sort of impact to Izz’s head, whether as a result of its being pushed against the van floorboard or through an accidental fall. Indeed, on the basis of the accused’s narrative at trial, there were three discrete points in time at which Izz’s head impacted a solid surface: once on the van floorboard, once on the van footrest, and once on the car park floor. In such circumstances, one would have expected the accused to seek swift medical attention for Izz – and yet the evidence showed a striking reluctance on his part to do any such thing. It was not disputed that in the immediate aftermath of the incident, the accused did not call for an ambulance, nor did he bring Izz to a hospital. He also did not seek help from his family members who were at that point in his parents’ flat mere minutes away from the Yishun MSCP.

The accused’s behaviour from the time he drove into the NUH carpark, to the time he and Nadiah reached the A&amp;E department, was captured on CCTV footage. The behaviour shown in this undisputed CCTV footage lent support to Nadiah’s testimony that the accused had all along been “delaying the time to go to the hospital”. For one, the CCTV footage showed that between the time the accused parked his van and the time when he and Nadiah started walking towards the A&amp;E, there was a time lapse of 16 minutes. Nadiah’s evidence was that the accused had spent that time cleaning and grooming himself, as he had expressed worry that he might be remanded by the police. I accepted her evidence. The accused himself, when shown the screenshots of the CCTV footage, appeared stumped and was initially unable to furnish any explanation for the 16-minute time lapse. He subsequently claimed to have been looking for his “spare phone” in the car – but his responses showed that he clearly recognised this story about looking for his “spare phone” could not account for the full 16-minute time lapse, as he conceded that “the rest [he] can’t remember”. Indeed, he appeared to realise belatedly that given his evidence that he himself had suggested bringing Izz to the A&amp;E when Izz “looked very weak”, the 16-minute delay looked incriminating – as he also conceded that he had made a “mistake”.

Nadiah testified that the delay was due to the accused’s insistence on looking for a suitable spot to dispose of his mobile phone. The accused did not – and could not –deny this, since the CCTV footage showed him leaving Nadiah waiting at the Kopitiam outlet and even walking out of the NUS compound at one point. When asked about the apparent procrastination on his part, he claimed that “a lot of things” had been running through his mind. This explanation rang false, since his evidence was also that he had believed at the time that Izz was “still alive” but “<span class="font-italic">extremely weak</span>”. Given his alleged belief, it was unbelievable that he would have spent this length of time looking – twice – for a spot to dispose of his phone.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Despite the accused’s various glib excuses, therefore, the undisputed CCTV footage of his behaviour upon arrival at NUH showed that he was in no hurry at all to get Izz to a doctor.

First, Nadiah gave evidence that on their way to NUH, the accused had stopped the van and suggested to her that they pay someone to bury Izz before reporting Izz missing to the police “maybe a year later”.

</div> This idea of concealing the true nature of Izz’s death was, by any measure, a shocking one: there was no reason for the accused to have come up with such a proposal unless there was something about Izz’s injuries that was highly suspicious – in other words, non-accidental. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The accused denied having made such a suggestion and claimed that Nadiah must have been motivated to fabricate this evidence after being remanded by the police and threatened by the IO.

Yet the startling accusations about Nadiah’s alleged deceitfulness in fabricating evidence and her motive for doing so were never put to Nadiah in cross-examination; nor did the Defence seek at any point to summon as witness the “male cousin” who had purportedly told the accused about her being remanded and threatened. The accusations against Nadiah were made belatedly by the accused when the Prosecution put it to him in cross-examination that he had initially planned to evade arrest and remand by trying to persuade Nadiah to agree to burying Izz in secret.

</div> and whilst the accused disagreed with some portions of her account, he admitted in cross-examination having told her to tell the hospital that Izz had accidentally fallen from his arm, and he had also told her the version of events he would be giving the hospital. On his own admission, this was a version which featured Izz “suddenly fidgeting” and falling out of his arm, hitting his head on the van floorboard, bouncing, hitting his head a second time on the footstep, and finally falling head-first onto the floor.

</div>
</div> That the accused should have had to brief Nadiah in detail about the story to be told to the hospital was not just odd; it was highly suspicious. After all, the accused himself conceded that Nadiah was not present during the incident at the Yishun MSCP: he was the only eyewitness to the incident, and she would not know what had happened. His actions in briefing her on – and getting her agreement to – the “accidental fall” story strongly suggested that he was making sure they both got their stories straight before they brought Izz to the hospital. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Third, the accused’s remark to Nadiah about fearing the possibility of remand by the police was also telling. If Izz had sustained an accidental fall after “suddenly” fidgeting and pitching out of the accused’s arm, then even assuming the accused was concerned that he might be regarded as having been “careless”, there was no reason for his thoughts to turn so swiftly to the possibility of remand by the police.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Seen as a whole therefore, the accused’s conduct subsequent to the Yishun MSCP incident – from his initial attempt to persuade Nadiah to have Izz buried secretly, to his efforts to ensure they both had the “accidental fall” story straight before proceeding to NUH, his procrastination in bringing Izz to the A&amp;E, and finally his concern about the possibility of remand – strongly suggested that he knew Izz was already dead by the time they reached NUH and was reluctant to face the prospect of the police inquiring into the cause of death. This supported the Prosecution’s case that Izz’s death was caused by an act of the accused, and not an accidental fall.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adverse inference under s 261 CPC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Finally, the Prosecution’s case was bolstered by the adverse inference I drew against the accused for failing to mention the “accidental fall” story in both his cautioned statements. In his cautioned statement of 8 November 2019, in response to a charge of voluntarily causing Izz grievous hurt by “slamming his head against the floorboard” of the van, the accused expressed remorse and pleaded for leniency without saying anything about an “accidental fall”. In his cautioned statement of 14 November 2019, in response to a charge of committing murder by causing Izz’s death, the accused again expressed remorse and pleaded for leniency; and again, nothing was said about an “accidental fall”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 While the accused gave various reasons for the omission, I did not find any of his reasons believable. In respect of the 8 November 2019 cautioned statement, he alleged that the officers escorting him on 8 November 2019 had scared and confused him by “shouting” questions at him. This allegation rang false. It was only raised for the first time when the accused was cross-examined about the 8 November 2019 cautioned statement; and he did not identify any of the officers involved. Moreover, although he claimed to have been overcome with confusion, exhaustion and grief at the material time, a perusal of the cautioned statement showed that he had kept his wits about him sufficiently to mention exculpatory matters such as his remorse, his youth and his resolve to “take note that such thing won’t happen again in the future”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 As for the 14 November 2019 cautioned statement, when asked about his failure to mention the “accidental fall” story, the accused sought to brush it aside, saying that prior to 14 November 2019, he had already told the doctors and police officers at NUH about Izz accidentally falling from his arm.

</div>
</div> in describing how he had pushed Izz’s head towards the van floorboard twice, the accused said that he had “used mild force”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I make the following points about the issue of the accused’s intention. First, the accused’s assertion that he had no intention to <span class="font-italic">kill</span> Izz – even if true – did not assist his defence. In respect of the second element of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge, the Prosecution did not need to prove that he had intended to kill Izz: as the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chee Wee</span> (at [42]), it is “in fact irrelevant whether or not the accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily injury or injuries intentionally caused”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Second, as the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye </span>(at [37]), in order for the prosecution to establish the second element of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge, it should be noted that “it is the particular and not the precise bodily injury that must be intended”. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>, the deceased Bock was stabbed in the legs while being robbed by the two respondents Lim and Koh (as well as a third man Ng who subsequently fled the country). One of the stab wounds to Bock’s legs caused his death. Lim and Koh were charged with murder under s 302, read with s 34 of the Penal Code, with the prosecution relying on s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). The trial judge acquitted them of the murder charge and convicted them on lesser charges of robbery with hurt under s 394 PC. On appeal by the prosecution, the CA set aside the convictions on the charges of robbery with hurt and convicted both men of the original murder charges. The CA noted that the trial judge had specifically found that Lim – and Ng too – intended to stab Bock, and in particular, to cause stab wounds to his legs / thigh. The CA noted, further, that the trial judge had acquitted Lim and Koh of murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) because (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) his “entire thesis would appear to be that as there was no intention to sever Bock’s femoral vein, a case under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was not made out”. In holding that the trial judge had erred in coming to this conclusion, the CA held (at [37] – [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37     … We accept that Lim (and Ng) did not know that there was a main artery running through the leg and that the bleeding, if unattended to, would, in the normal course of nature, cause death; however, under the <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> principle, it is never a requirement that the accused must realise the full gravity of his act.  What is essential is that the particular injury which eventually caused death in the normal course of nature was inflicted by the accused intentionally and not accidentally.  To the extent that the trial judge seemed to think that the loss of blood was the “injury”, he had fallen into error; the loss of blood was a consequence of the stab wounds which finally caused death… (I)t is quite plain that under <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span>, for a case under s 300(c) to be made out, it is the particular and not the precise injury that must be intended…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38     In finding that the severing of Bock’s femoral vein was accidental, the trial judge relied on the Indian case of <span class="font-italic">Harjinder Singh v Delhi Administration</span> AIR 1968 SC 867… where the accused had stabbed the victim in the thigh and severed an artery.  It seems to us that in <span class="font-italic">Harjinder Singh</span>, the Supreme Court, which acquitted the accused of murder, was not concerned with the question of whether the accused intended to sever the artery but whether he intended to cause the particular injuries that were found on the victim.  The court said (at [9]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our opinion, the circumstances justify the inference that the accused did not intend to cause an injury on this particular portion of the thigh… In these circumstances, it cannot be said that it has been proved that it was the intention of the [accused] to inflict this particular injury on this particular place.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39     In contrast, here Lim (and Ng too) intended to stab Bock’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping and, in the case of Ng, to teach Bock a lesson.  That was not the case in <span class="font-italic">Harjinder Singh</span>.  Furthermore, there was evidence of a fight in <span class="font-italic">Harjinder Singh</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40     It is true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a part of the body which is not commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body.  However, that is not a consideration that affects the operation of s 300(c).  As the forensic pathologist had emphasized, the thigh is a less vital region of the body only from the strictly lay perspective.  The crucial question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which Lim and Ng intended to cause.  Whether they knew the seriousness of the wounds is neither here nor there…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In <span class="font-italic">PP v Toh Sia Guan </span>[2020] SGHC 92 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span>”)

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  The accused’s appeal against conviction and sentence in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan </span>was dismissed by the CA in Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2020: [2021] SGCA 7.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>, where the accused Toh was charged with murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) PC, the fatal injury inflicted on the deceased was a through-and-through V-shaped stab wound to the inside of the right upper arm, formed by two stab wounds joined at the apex of the “V” which completely cut the right branchial artery and cut into the basilic vein. In finding that Toh possessed the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>for the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) offence, the High Court referenced the CA’s judgement in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>; in particular, the CA’s statement that the prosecution only had to show that the accused caused the particular but not the precise injury. Elaborating on its understanding of the CA’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>, the High Court noted (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are two competing interests at play in determining the requisite level of particularity. On one hand, the test cannot be so narrow as to be impossible to prove. On the other hand, it cannot be too broad such that the accused is convicted of murder for an injury he did not intend. A broad-based, simple and common-sense approach has to be adopted (Virsa Singh at [21]), drawing a middle ground between the competing interests. This has to be a fact specific inquiry, depending on the circumstances of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The High Court went on to observe that the precedents on s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) showed that the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>would usually be satisfied if the prosecution proved intention to attack the limb where the injury was found. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>, <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>was established by finding that the accused person intended to stab the deceased’s thigh. As another example, in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lie Sian v PP </span>[2019] 2 SLR 439 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Lie Sian</span>”), where the accused had hit the deceased several times on the head and body with a metal rod and where the cause of death was bronchopneumonia following multiple fractures of the skull, the CA held that <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> for murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was established by evidence that the accused had intended to hit the deceased’s head.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span>, the High Court noted that there was some controversy in the case before it over whether the requisite mental element of the offence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the intention to inflict an injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death) could be satisfied, in the situation where Toh and the deceased were involved in a fight, merely by the prosecution proving that Toh had intended to attack the wider part of the body on which the fatal injury was found (the deceased’s <span class="font-italic">upper arm torso area</span>), instead of having to prove that Toh intended to inflict the particular fatal injury on the specific part of the limb in question (in this case, <span class="font-italic">the deceased’s right upper arm</span>). The court took the view that it was not necessary to decide the controversy on the facts of this case since Toh’s intention to stab the deceased’s right upper arm was established on the facts (at [58] – [64]). On appeal, the CA agreed with the High Court’s conclusion that it was not necessary to decide the controversy for the reasons stated by the court; in particular, since it involved “deciding whether or not to add a further normative gloss on what is essentially a factual inquiry”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In the present case, I approached the issue of <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>on the basis that it was – as the CA in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan </span>stressed – essentially a factual inquiry. At the same time, as the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan </span>pointed out, the precedents in this area were useful in illustrating that the courts have usually found <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>in a s 300(c) case to be satisfied if the prosecution proved intention to attack the limb where the injury was found. The Prosecution in this case took the position that <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>would be established by their proving that the accused had intended to cause head injuries to Izz when he pushed the latter’s head against the floorboard of the van.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I rejected the Defence’s submission and accepted the Prosecution’s, for the following reasons. The test which the Defence posited for <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was so narrow that it would be satisfied only in the case of an accused person with medical knowledge and an understanding of the structure of the human brain. Such an approach would run contrary to the approach of the court in the cases examined above: as seen earlier, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span>, the prosecution was only required to prove that Lim and Ng had intended to inflict stab wounds to Bock’s thigh, and not that they had intended to sever his femoral artery (or even that they knew there was a main artery running through the leg and that the bleeding, left unattended, would cause death in the normal course of nature); in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span>, the court was satisfied with proof that the accused had intended to stab the deceased’s right upper arm and did not require proof that he had intended to cut through the right branchial artery and into the basilic vein. In the context of the present case, in my view, the Prosecution was required to prove that in pushing Izz’s head against the floorboard, the accused had acted with the intention to cause head injuries to Izz. Contrary to the Defence’s submission, the Prosecution in this case was not required to prove that the accused intended specifically to cause the acute subdural haemorrhage, the acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and the cerebral oedema which eventually led to Izz’s death. Following the CA’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Lye</span> (at [37]), the traumatic intracranial haemorrhage – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the rupturing of the blood vessels on the surface of the brain –– was not the “injury” for the purposes of the second element of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) offence in this case, but the consequence of the blunt force trauma to the head which ultimately caused death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Third, in respect of the accused’s contention that he used only “mild force” to push Izz’s head against the van floorboard, this too did not assist him. In cross-examination, Defence counsel also sought to emphasize that Izz’s skull had not been fractured and that “(b)esides the injury to the meninges, the other parts of the brain were not affected”. Insofar as these assertions were meant to highlight the absence of any intention on the accused’s part to cause serious injury to Izz, there is ample caselaw (<span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh</span> at 468, cited by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tan Joo Cheng v PP</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219 at [15]) which has established that:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The question is not whether the [accused] intended to inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that is proved to be present</span>.

</div> In gist, the absence of skull fractures in this case was not surprising or anomalous, given the pliability of a child’s skull; and the absence of skull fractures in no way precluded or militated against the rupturing of the blood vessels on the surface of the brain, as the force applied to the head would still be transmitted through the skull to the brain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The Defence also appeared to think it was significant that Dr Lau had found Izz to be “apparently somewhat undernourished”.

</div> Unfortunately, the defence submissions were not clear as to the relevance of this finding. In any event, Dr Lau was asked in cross-examination whether Izz’s undernourished state would have “contributed to the causation of the traumatic intracranial haemorrhage”; and Dr Lau’s answer was an emphatic “No”. As he explained, there was “no reason why the child being underweight would have contributed to the causation of the traumatic intracranial haemorrhage”: Izz’s undernourished or underweight state simply had “no bearing on the effect or the forces that might have been brought to bear upon [him]”.

</div> Dr Lau’s evidence on this matter was not refuted by the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 As for the Defence’s submission that the accused could not have intended to cause the fatal head injuries because they were “not the ordinary and natural consequence of the accused’s act” and could not be said to be within the reasonable contemplation of the accused, this submission too was misconceived. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no basis for the Defence to rely on <span class="font-italic">PP v AFR </span>[2011] 3 SLR 653 (“<span class="font-italic">AFR</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">AFR</span>, the cause of death was rupture to the deceased’s inferior vena cava (a large vein that transports blood from the lower half of the body to the right atrium of the heart). The trial judge in <span class="font-italic">AFR</span> concluded from the forensic pathologist’s evidence that such an injury was very rare; that it was not really known how this kind of injury occurred; that such injury had only been known to occur in car crashes or falls from height; and that he could not say exactly how such an injury could have occurred in a case where the accused had slapped, punched and kicked the deceased without breaking any bones. In the trial judge’s view, the point he had to decide was the extent to which the accused could reasonably have known that the beating he was administering to the deceased could have caused the rupture; and since even an experienced pathologist could not be certain as to how the rupture had happened in that case, the trial judge did not think it could be said that the injury was the ordinary and natural consequence of the accused’s act of beating the deceased and/or that it was well within the contemplation of any normal person. The facts of the <span class="font-italic">AFR </span>case were thus – as the trial judge made clear – very different from cases such as <span class="font-italic">Virsa Singh </span>where “the consequences of injuries by stabbing with knives or spears or drowning in water, are well within ordinary human knowledge or experience” (at [37]). (I note by the way that the prosecution in <span class="font-italic">AFR </span>did not appeal against the trial judge’s decision to acquit the accused of the charge of murder and to convict him of the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) PC – although it did appeal successfully against the sentence imposed on this lesser charge.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The facts of <span class="font-italic">AFR</span> being as exceptional as they were, the conclusion which the trial judge came to in that case was of no assistance to the accused in this case. It was simply not possible to say that the consequence of inflicting head injuries on a 9 month-old by pushing his head against a hard surface was something that was outside of “ordinary human knowledge or experience”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third element of the s 300(c) charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In respect of the third element of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge, the Prosecution was required to prove that the bodily injury intended to be inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. From Dr Lau’s evidence, it was clear that the blunt force trauma to Izz’s head was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

</div> In both cross-examination and closing submissions, the defence did not challenge Dr Lau’s evidence on this issue; nor did the defence adduce any medical evidence of its own to refute his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issue of motive</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 I address at this juncture the issue of motive. Insofar as the relevance of an accused’s motive to the proof of an offence is concerned, the CA has explained in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari v PP</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (“<span class="font-italic">Johari</span>”) at [58] that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…(W)hile motive is not an essential element of the crime, it can “bolster an inference that an intention to commit the offence was existent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 In the present case, it will be remembered that in his statements to the police, the accused referred several times to Izz crying just prior to his pushing the latter’s head against the floorboard. To recapitulate: in his 8 Nov 2019 statement, the accused recounted how he had found Izz crying when he returned from Sheng Siong Supermarket to the van. In the statement recorded on 13 November 2019 at 9.45 a.m., in response to a question about what was “in [his] mind when [he] pushed Izz’s head towards the floorboard”, the accused had initially stated that he felt “<span class="font-italic">rimas</span>” (a word he understood as meaning “uneasy”) over Izz’s crying before cancelling the words “over Izz’s crying”. In the 14 November 2019 cautioned statement, in response to a charge of murder which alleged that he had caused Izz’s death, the accused initially said that he “did it in the moment of anger” before requesting the deletion of the word “anger” and its replacement with the word “frustration”. It will also be remembered that when confronted with the 14 November 2019 cautioned statement during cross-examination, the accused claimed that the recorder ASP Desmond Ng had supplied the word “anger” and he himself had spoken “wrongly” when he used the word “frustration”.

</div> – when confronted with his original statement on 13 November 2019 about having felt uneasy “over Izz’s crying”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Having considered the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that it was the accused himself who told the police that he had felt uneasy over Izz’s crying and that he had pushed Izz’s head against the floorboard in a moment of frustration. In respect of the 14 November 2019 cautioned statement, ASP Desmond Ng’s testimony was corroborated by that of the Malay interpreter Ms Maria. Having regard to their evidence, which I found cogent and consistent, I was satisfied that the initial use of the word “anger” and its subsequent replacement with the word “frustration” both emanated from the accused. I rejected the accused’s story about having answered “wrongly” when he used the word “frustration”. His story simply did not make sense: <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, he could not offer any reason as to why he would have “wrongly” blurted out this word as a replacement for the word “anger”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The accused’s story about having “answered wrongly” in using the phrase “over Izz’s crying” in his 13 November 2019 statement was just as nonsensical. Again, there was no explanation as to why the inclusion of this phrase constituted a “wrong” answer on his part – whether, for example, it was because there was something factually erroneous or inaccurate about this phrase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Having found that it was the accused himself who told the police he had felt uneasy over Izz’s crying and that he had pushed Izz’s head against the floorboard in a moment of frustration, I found that these statements supported the Prosecution’s case about the motive behind the accused’s actions: namely, that the accused had been frustrated – or had at least been made uneasy – by Izz’s repeated crying; and that he had reacted to this frustration or unease by pushing Izz’s head against the floorboard. I also agreed with the Prosecution that it was concern about the potentially “incriminating” effect of the references to Izz’s crying that prompted the accused to request the deletion of the phrase “over Izz’s crying” from his 13 November 2019 statement. It was clear to me that his excuse about having given “wrong” answers was simply a ploy on his part to disavow anything in his statements which – in retrospect – appeared incriminating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 In this connection, tellingly, the remark about having felt uneasy <span class="font-italic">over Izz’s crying</span> was repeated by the accused during his first interview with Dr Cheow on 4 December 2019. In his IMH report, Dr Cheow stated that the accused had recounted how he felt “uncomfortable” due to Izz’s crying – but had then objected to Dr Cheow describing him as being “disturbed” by the crying “as he felt that it would sound incriminating if he admitted to being “disturbed by the crying””.

</div> the accused recanted the version of events given at the first interview. In its place, the accused offered a hybrid version in which he “accidentally ended up pushing [Izz] forward” while attempting to soothe Izz after the latter “[fell] down and hit [his] head against the plywood floor”. This frankly unbelievable hybrid version was abandoned by the accused himself, who did not repeat it in his Case for the Defence nor at trial. Notably, however, even in this hybrid version, the accused acknowledged that it was Izz’s crying that led to his “patting [Izz’s] neck” in an attempt to soothe the boy. Clearly, Izz’s crying – and the persistence of that crying – were the factors that triggered a physical response from the accused on 7 November 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Following the CA’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Johari</span>, the evidence as to the accused’s motive was relevant to proof of the second element of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge, in that it bolstered the inference that the blunt force trauma to Izz’s head was intentionally inflicted by the accused – as opposed to being the result of some accidental or inadvertent movement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 In the interests of completeness, I should state that although there was some suggestion that the accused was angered by Izz spilling a drink on him during dinner at Long John Silver, I did not place any weight on this suggestion. Even if it were true that Izz had spilt a drink on the accused, this would have happened hours before the incident at the Yishun MSCP: there was no evidence to suggest that it had any bearing on the accused’s actions at the Yishun MSCP.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Character evidence from the accused’s sister</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 Finally, in respect of the evidence given by the accused’s sister Atikah regarding the accused’s love for children and his capacity for hard work, I did not find that the evidence assisted his defence. Having observed the accused closely in the witness stand and having assessed his evidence against the other evidence available in this case, I found him to be a glib and disingenuous witness. Not only was it clear that he had made up the story about an “accidental fall” in order to evade accountability for his actions, when it became apparent during the trial that his lies were unravelling, he sought to smear Nadiah and various police witnesses by levelling false accusations against them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Mei Yoong Letticia v PP </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 897 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Mei Yoong Letticia</span>”), the appellant - who was tried for an offence of employing an immigration offender under s 57(1)(ii) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) – produced at trial “an impressive testimonial of good character from a very distinguished and highly respected senior civil servant who had known her for 40 years, stating that it was totally out of character for the appellant to have done anything illegal” (at [34]). In dismissing the appellant’s appeal against her conviction, the High Court held that the trial judge had not erred in attaching little or no weight to the testimonial as far as the appellant’s credibility was concerned. The High Court acknowledged that as a matter of general principle, evidence of good character is “generally relevant to the credibility of an appellant as a witness”. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Mei Yoong Letticia</span>, however,<span class="font-italic"> </span>while there was no doubt that the appellant was “generally of good character”, she had been “less than truthful and forthright with respect to a number of matters”; and as such, the evidence of good character “was rendered of little assistance to the appellant in this case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 In the present case, I found it difficult to accept that the somewhat sketchy and one-sided testimony from Atikah sufficed to demonstrate general good character on the accused’s part. However, even if I were to accept that the accused was generally of good character, having regard to the clear evidence of his many lies and obfuscations in this case, such character evidence was of little (if any) assistance in propping up his credibility.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the s 300(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) charge against the accused</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 At the conclusion of the trial, as I found that the Prosecution had successfully proved all the elements of the s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge of murder, I convicted the accused of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Pursuant to s 302(2) of the PC, whoever commits murder within the meaning of s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, and shall – if he is not punished with death – also be liable to caning. In this case, upon the accused being convicted, the Prosecution informed me that it would not be seeking the death penalty. Having considered the present facts in the light of the relevant caselaw, I did not find that the circumstances of this case warranted the death penalty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The test for when the death penalty is appropriate in s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) PC cases has been articulated in cases such as <span class="font-italic">PP v Kho Jabing</span> [2015] 2 SLR 112 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span>”). In that case, the court held (at [44] – [46]) that the applicable principle in deciding whether the death penalty should be meted out is “whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community”. This is because capital punishment is “an expression of society’s indignation towards particularly offensive conduct”: the fact that the death penalty continues to be part of our sentencing regime is “an expression of society’s belief that certain actions are so grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent that the death penalty may, in the face of such circumstances, be the appropriate, if not the only, adequate sentence”. In determining whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community, the death penalty is the appropriate sentence where the offender has acted in a manner that shows viciousness or a disregard for human life. It is therefore the manner in which the offender has acted which takes centre stage, though other facts such as the offender’s age and intelligence continue to be relevant: <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> at [48]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 The application of this principle is usefully illustrated in a number of cases. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chia Kee Chen</span> [2018] 2 SLR 249, the CA overturned the trial judge’s decision to sentence the accused, Chia, to life imprisonment. The CA found (at [139]) that there was a high degree of planning and premeditation. Further, the attack was vicious: the accused had suffered extensive fractures in his skull; almost every bone from the bottom of his eye socket to his lower jaw was fractured: <span class="font-italic">Chia Kee Chen </span>at [140]. Finally, Chia had (at [141]) displayed a blatant disregard for the deceased’s life: he had stated that he desired for the deceased to suffer as much as possible before dying and the only regret he ever expressed was that the deceased had died before he could inflict more suffering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 In contrast, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Sian</span> ruled that the prosecution had not established that the appellant was acting at the material time with a blatant disregard for human life. For one, the appellant was (at [88]) unaware at the time of the attack, or in its immediate aftermath, of the fatal nature of the victim’s injuries. There was also no evidence that the appellant had intended for the victim to suffer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 This was also the case in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Boh Soon Ho [</span>2020] SGHC 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Boh Soon Ho</span>”). In that case, the accused had over the course of four to five years spent approximately half his income on the victim, and tried to woo her. But the victim had no romantic interest of any sort in him. The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back came when the victim revealed that she had been intimate with her former boyfriend. In a fit of rage, the accused strangled the victim to death (<span class="font-italic">Boh Soon Ho</span> at [17] – [19]). The court accepted (at [109]) that “the present case was not one that so outraged the feelings of the community as to call for the death sentence”. The accused had acted “without premeditation and the manner in which he killed the deceased could not be said to have crossed the threshold of acting with viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life”. The appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the CA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 In <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span>, the accused had gotten into a fight with the victim. After this altercation, the accused went and bought a pair of slippers and a knife. Shortly thereafter, he returned to the area where he got into another fight with the victim. Armed with the knife, the accused stabbed the victim a few times. The court found that the death penalty was not warranted. For one, the prosecution bore the burden of proving that the actions of the accused outraged the feelings of the community; and this was not done as the prosecution had made no submissions on this issue. In any case, the following factors weighed against the imposition of the death penalty. First, the accused did not know that the injury he caused was fatal, either during the time of the attack, or thereafter: this supported the conclusion that there was no blatant disregard for human life (<span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span> at [119]). It was also not proven that the accused had any intention to want the victim to suffer as much as possible, or that he had inflicted completely unnecessary additional blows even after the accused had stopped reacting. The case also lacked a high degree of premeditation and planning. Finally, while the level of viciousness in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span> was reprehensible, it was not of such a degree so as to outrage the feelings of the community (<span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span> at [122]). No caning was imposed in light of the accused’s age. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The accused’s appeal in against conviction and sentence in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan</span> was dismissed by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Toh Sia Guan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] SGCA 7. Rejecting the accused’s argument that the sentence of life imprisonment was too harsh, the CA noted that under s 302(2) of the Penal Code, there were only two available sentencing options for murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>): the death penalty or life imprisonment. The CA thus held that the trial judge could not have imposed a more lenient sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In the present case, the Prosecution did not seek to prove that the actions of the accused had outraged the feelings of the community. On the facts of this case, I did not think that the death penalty was warranted. There was no evidence of a “blatant disregard for human life” on the accused’s part; nor was there evidence of premeditation and planning, and/or of a desire on the accused’s part for Izz to suffer. As I earlier stated when considering the issue of motive, the accused’s actions appeared to have been carried out in a fit of frustration or anger. While the act of pushing a 9 month-old’s head against the floor of a van was certainly reprehensible, I did not think the level of viciousness in this case could be said to have risen to such a degree that the feelings of the community would be outraged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 For these reasons, I found that the death penalty was not called for in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 As to caning, s 302(2) of the PC provides that an offender who is sentenced to a term of life imprisonment shall also be liable to caning. The Prosecution submitted that the accused should, in addition to a term of life imprisonment, be sentenced to 15 to 18 strokes of the cane. The Defence, on the other hand, argued that 5 to 6 strokes of the cane would be appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 While there have been cases under s 302(2) PC where the courts have imposed the maximum number of strokes of the cane alongside a sentence of life imprisonment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Wang Wanfeng</span>; also <span class="font-italic">Micheal Anak Garing v Public Prosecutor and anor appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 748), there is nothing in s 302(2) which mandates that the maximum number of the strokes must be meted out in the event that a term of life imprisonment is imposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In exercising my discretion under s 302(2), I was guided by the following principles. Our courts have consistently adopted a tough stance towards offenders who cause the deaths of defenceless young victims by violence (per the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PP v AFR</span> [2011] 3 SLR 833 (“<span class="font-italic">AFR</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [14]). An offender’s culpability will generally be viewed as being enhanced when the victim is vulnerable; and as the CA noted in <span class="font-italic">PP v BDB</span> [2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) (at [37]), among vulnerable victims, young victims are notable for several reasons. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, there will, more often than not, be a gross physical disparity at play; and as a result, the victims will often be defenceless and unable to protect themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 This was certainly the case here. As I have earlier noted, Izz, was a 9-month-old baby measuring only 71 cm in height and weighing only 7.3kg at the time of death: Dr Lau’s evidence was that these measurements corresponded approximately to the 50th and the 3rd percentiles for the expected height and weight, respectively, of a 9 month-old male child. The accused, in contrast, is a full-grown male adult. As the CA has emphasized in cases such as <span class="font-italic">AFR</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, retribution is a key sentencing consideration in cases where violence has been inflicted on a child (<span class="font-italic">AFR</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [32], <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [76]). In addition, it is important to send the clear message that no caregiver – whether a parent or any individual to whom the welfare of the child has been entrusted – has any licence to inflict violence with impunity on any young children in his or her charge. To borrow the words of the CA in its judgement in <span class="font-italic">AFR </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> (at [12]), any caregiver who does so will not be allowed (for mitigation purposes) to exclaim with regret that he did not mean to inflict violence on the victim in question, whom he professes to love. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 In <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>, the court – in considering cases involving abuse of young children where the accused had been charged under s 325 of the Penal Code – held that where death is caused in such cases, a sentence of 12 or more strokes of the cane may be warranted (at [76]). I did not think it was correct for Defence counsel to say that the CA’s remarks on caning in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> were entirely irrelevant to the present cases simply because <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> concerned a charge under s 325 of the Penal Code. The CA in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> held that 12 or more strokes of the cane was warranted in <span class="font-italic">s 325 </span><span class="font-italic">PC cases where death is caused</span>. It would be wrong in principle and manifestly inadequate for an accused convicted of causing the death of a child under the far more serious s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) charge to be sentenced only to “5 to 6 strokes” of the cane (as submitted for by the Defence).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 The Prosecution cited two cases where the accused persons were convicted of murder charges under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and one case where the accused was convicted of a s 300(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) murder charge for which the punishment is the same as that for s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, under s 302(2)). These three cases were unreported decisions. Unreported decisions should be approached with some caution because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the absence of written grounds of decision may make it difficult to arrive at a proper appraisal of these facts and circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence</span> [2020] 4 SLR 1412 at [86]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin</span> [2017] 5 SLR 671 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">GCM v Public Prosecutor and anor appeal</span> [2021] 4 SLR 1086 at [75]). Even approaching these cases with caution, however, I was unable to agree with the Defence that these three cases were “much more serious” than the present case. For one, while the mode of attack in each of these three cases was different (with two of them featuring the use of a weapon), the victims in these three cases were all adults, and not a defenceless 9-month-old child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that Izz’s extreme youth and total inability to defend himself rendered him an especially vulnerable victim and constituted an aggravating factor which must be taken into account in sentencing. Other aggravating factors included the fact that Izz had been entrusted by his mother Nadiah to the accused’s care on the night in question. In this connection, I must point out that the fact that the accused had volunteered or agreed to take care of Izz on that fateful night could not be a mitigating factor, since what he then did with the trust placed in him was – tragically – to violate that trust by inflicting physical violence on Izz and causing his death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 As the Prosecution also pointed out, the accused’s conduct following the violence inflicted on Izz showed a disturbing lack of remorse: he had, among other things, failed to seek immediate medical attention for Izz; he initially tried to get Nadiah to agree to paying someone to bury Izz and reporting him missing only a year later; when he could not persuade Nadiah to agree to this despicable suggestion, he sought to make sure she would tell the same story of an accidental fall; he repeatedly delayed bringing Izz and Nadiah to the A&amp;E department, even when they reached the hospital. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 As stated earlier, I did note that this was not a case of premeditated attack or prolonged abuse. It must be stressed, though, that the lack of premeditation and the absence of a prolonged period of abuse amounted only to the absence of aggravating circumstances, and not the existence of a mitigating factor <span class="font-italic">per se</span>: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [63].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 For completeness, I also noted that although the accused had an antecedent from 2016 (where he was fined $1000 for riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act (Cap 184)
