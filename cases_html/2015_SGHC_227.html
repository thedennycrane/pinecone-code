In this judgment, the charges will be referred to separately as the “First Charge” and “Second Charge”, and collectively as the “Charges”. In relation to both Charges, it was not only determined that the Respondent issued false death certifications, but also that he misled the investigators in an attempt to cover up his wrongdoing in the Second Charge. While the DT acknowledged the gravity of the offences, it imposed a sentence on the Respondent that struck us as manifestly inadequate. The DT decided that the Respondent should: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a) have his registration as a medical practitioner suspended for a period of three months on each charge, these to run concurrently;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(b) be censured;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(c) undertake in writing that he would henceforth not engage in the conduct complained of or any similar conduct; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(d) pay half of the costs and expenses of and incidental to the proceedings, including the costs of the Applicant’s solicitors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2 The DT’s grounds were also to be published with the necessary redactions made to the patients’ details.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3 The Applicant considered that the individual sentences as well as the total sentence were too lenient and accordingly appealed. At the conclusion of the oral submissions, we allowed the appeal and gave brief reasons for doing so.

The Applicant had not been able to take this point in past cases because it had no right of appeal in respect of proceedings brought under the MRA 2004, even if it was of the view that some of the sentences imposed in the past had been manifestly inadequate.

</div> Our impression was that his position before us seemed to contradict what he had said before the DT. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">28 We had no hesitation in allowing the appeal. In a nutshell, the issue before us was whether the sentences imposed by the DT were manifestly inadequate, and they undoubtedly were. In our judgment, the imposition of a three-month suspension was a manifestly inadequate sentence considering both the nature of the harm as well as the Respondent’s dishonest and evasive conduct. We now elaborate on the reasons, and also address certain key legal aspects in which the DT erred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The analogy to improperly certifying medical certificates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">29 We begin by observing that the sentence for the Prior Charge was indefensibly light. In any case, we consider it appropriate to re-visit the benchmark sentence where death certificates are improperly certified. Indeed, this was the sort of situation for which the legislative changes were effected in the MRA 2010, and as a result of which the Applicant is now able to bring appeals against sentences imposed by the DT which it considers unduly lenient. In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(11 January 2010) vol 86 (“<span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">he 11 January 2010 Debate</span>”) at cols 1898–1899, the then Minister for Health, Khaw Boon Wan, said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">The new section 55 sets out the framework for the SMC or an aggrieved complainant to appeal to the High Court against the Disciplinary Tribunal’s decisions. Currently, only the defendant doctor is allowed to appeal to the High Court on the decision of the Disciplinary Committee. This is not necessarily fair to the public or the complainant. This section allows the SMC to appeal when the Council is not in agreement with its independent Tribunal’s orders. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">30 Pursuant to the legislative changes, the court’s role is to correct the DT’s decisions where appropriate. This may require us from time to time to recalibrate the sort of sentence that should be considered for certain types of misconduct. The observations of Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kim Kwong v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2014] 4 SLR 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Kim Kwong</span>”) at [45]–[47] are apposite and bear reproducing at some length:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">… [W]e would emphasise that fidelity to precedent ought not to lead to ossification of the law. For circumstances change: the way medicine is practised now may be different in many respects from the way it was practised, say, a decade ago, and it may well be rather different from the way it will be practised a decade from today. A corollary of this is that, given two similar cases separated in time by a substantial number of years, the sentence that was appropriate in the earlier case may not necessarily be appropriate in the later.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">46 All we would say is that it is open to the Respondent in future cases to persuade the DC or this court that relevant sentencing precedents are no longer a helpful guide to the appropriate sanction that ought to be imposed because prevailing circumstances are materially different from those at the time when those precedents were decided. For example, from a cursory examination of the published grounds of decision of DC cases available on the Respondent’s website, we note that it is very rare for periods of suspension to exceed six months. There are two cases in which three years’ suspension was imposed, one involving gross overcharging of a patient and the other involving a sexual relationship lasting more than a decade between a medical professional and a patient who had psychiatric problems, but it would seem that these are exceptional.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">47 Indeed, the Respondent itself, in its written submissions, referred at least twice to the fact that the precedent concerned was dated, observing that the case of Dr S (discussed above at [31]) “took place almost 15 years ago and would not [be] reflective of the needs of the profession and the public today”, as well as observing that as two other cases “are very old precedents from almost 20 years ago, the DC is entitled to take the view that the benchmark should be moved in light of the prevailing circumstances today”. <span class="font-italic">But it is not enough to state that sentencing precedents should not be followed simply because they are from another era; some more concrete difference between the circumstances then and the circumstances now that calls for correspondingly different approaches or benchmarks should be demonstrated. Should the Respondent on some future occasion take the view that the sentencing tariffs have up to that point in time been set too low, whether generally or in respect of a particular type of case, this is something it should bear in mind when it makes the argument before the relevant adjudicatory body.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">31 The English experience has been similar; historically, decisions by the Fitness to Practise Panel (“FPP”) and their predecessors were final subject only to limited rights of appeal by the doctor. Concerns were expressed about this limitation, and the Council for the Regulation of Health Professions (subsequently renamed the Council for Health Regulatory Excellence) was created in 2002. One of its functions was to appeal against decisions of the General Medical Council which it considered were unduly lenient. The courts would approach such appeals by considering whether the sentences imposed fall outside the reasonable range of sanctions available to the sentencing court in the circumstances: Mark Davies, <span class="font-italic">Medical Self-Regulation: Crisis and Change</span> (Ashgate, 2007) at p 327. In <span class="font-italic">Council for the Regulation of Health</span><span class="font-italic"> Care Professionals v General Medical Council and another </span>[2004] 1 WLR 2432, Leveson J observed at [14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">Miss Morris argued that there is a clear distinction between the criminal and disciplinary jurisdictions because criminal sentencing is concerned with punishment and disciplinary sanction with protection of the public. As I have just accepted, I agree that there is a very real difference between the two, but that difference is not to the point in relation to the proper construction of this provision. <span class="font-italic">The context in which undue lenience must be considered may be different for criminal cases (concerned with retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation) and disciplinary cases (concerned with the protection of the public and the reputation of the profession) but the relevant question remains the same, namely, whether, having regard to the purposes of the particular sanction being imposed (whether criminal or disciplinary), this particular sanction is outside the range of sanctions which the sentencing tribunal, applying its mind to all the factors relevant to its jurisdiction, could reasonably consider appropriate.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">32 In its submissions, the Applicant pointed us to the disparity in sentencing between doctors who were found guilty of improperly certifying deaths, and those found guilty of improperly issuing medical certificates. To begin with, we do not think the two are even analogous. Medical certificates are generally issued to and used by patients to justify their taking medical leave from work, or for them to be excused from certain responsibilities. While the issuance of a false medical certificate is a serious matter, the fact remains that in general, the only direct harm that will result from this is a loss of money or productivity. Far more severe consequences can result from improper death certifications as will be seen at [52]–[53] below. We therefore considered that the analogy between improperly issuing medical certificates and improperly issuing death certificates is an inappropriate one for purposes of sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">33 We noted that doctors found to have improperly granted a medical certificate had been suspended for up to 12 months, especially in instances where the doctor concerned had attempted to cover up his or her actions. In that light, the sentences imposed for improper death certifications appeared grossly and disproportionately light. The Applicant tendered the following precedents relating to improper death certifications before us:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a) Dr X was charged with improperly certifying three causes of death. He pleaded guilty and cooperated fully with the authorities. The police excluded any foul play. Dr X also stopped providing death certifications in ad-hoc cases.

Under s 35D(2)(b) of the Medical Act 1983 (c 54) (UK) (“the Medical Act”), the FPP is empowered to suspend the doctor’s registration for a period not exceeding 12 months at any one time, although under s 35D(5)(a), it also has the power, if appropriate, to extend the period of suspension from the time when it would otherwise expire. Under s 41A(1)(a) of the Medical Act, the Interim Orders Panel (“IOP”) is authorised to suspend a doctor for up to 18 months in the interim if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the protection of the public or it is otherwise in the public interest to do so. In comparison, the DT’s sentencing jurisdiction is found in s 53(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MRA 2010, where it can suspend the doctor’s registration for not less than three months and not more than three years. These differences are relevant to our discussion on sentencing considerations at [46]–[60] below, and we took this into account when we considered the length of suspension that should be imposed on the Respondent. But conscious of the relevant differences, we turn first to three English cases which dealt with falsely certified deaths. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">41 The first case is <span class="font-italic">Jasinarachchi</span><span class="font-italic"> v General Medical Council </span>[2014] EWHC 3570 (Admin) (“<span class="font-italic">Jasinarachchi</span>”), where a trainee doctor, because of his desire to catch a flight, had falsely declared that he had seen the patient’s body and conducted an external examination on her. He completed the cremation certificate and also lied to the Funeral Directors that he had seen the patient’s body after her death. He then flew off to Australia for two weeks. It subsequently became apparent that the doctor had not attended to the patient at all. The cremation certificate could not be used, and as a result, the patient’s planned cremation was delayed. A family member had to identify the body, and a post mortem was performed on the patient (at [15]). The doctor was punished with a six-month suspension. In meting out this punishment, the FPP noted that the dishonesty in this instance was <span class="font-italic">not premeditated </span>and was in fact an uncharacteristic reaction to his circumstances. It was said to be a “single episode in an otherwise unblemished career” (at [18]). The FPP also considered the following mitigating factors: (a) the absence of any repetition of his misconduct; (b) his developing maturity as a doctor; (c) the lack of financial gain behind his actions; and (d) his apology made to the patient’s family which they accepted. It was in such circumstances that the FPP considered a suspension to be sufficient to warn the wider profession that such dishonest behaviour was unacceptable, and fell short of the standards expected of a doctor (at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">42 The second case is the decision of the FPP of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in the case of Dr Amit Pramanik<span class="font-italic"> </span>(16 May 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Amit</span>”), where the doctor was charged with five counts of making false statements that he had examined deceased patients’ bodies. The acts of dishonesty were not isolated and greatly undermined the fundamental tenets of the profession as his misconduct consisted of “a significant number of individual acts, committed over a number of months.” It was held at p 9 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">The Panel noted that you have been convicted of [falsely certifying a death certificate] and that your misconduct consisted of a significant number of individual acts, committed over a number of months. <span class="font-italic">You undermined an important system of death certification and cremation and abused the trust of the medical referee.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">43 Despite the gravity of his actions, the doctor in <span class="font-italic">Amit</span> was eventually given a six-month suspension after the FPP took into account the mitigating factors in his favour. These included his admission of wrongdoing immediately after being questioned about his misconduct, his issuance of an apology letter and acts of remorse, the high quality of his reflective notes with respect to his Continuous Professional Development, and the positive testimonies about his clinical skills and good character. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">44 The third case is <span class="font-italic">Martin </span><span class="font-italic">Sandler v General Medical Council </span>[2010] EWHC 1029 (Admin) (“<span class="font-italic">Sandler</span>”), where the doctor received an interim 18-month suspension from the IOP pending his hearing before the FPP (at [1]). He sought to terminate the suspension order so that he could work. The IOP held that as the doctor had apparently wilfully signed false certificates on at least 116 occasions, the reputation of the profession could be adversely affected if he were allowed to continue practising (at [10]). His application to lift the interim suspension order was denied. Nicol J considered that the reputation of the medical profession would be adversely affected if his suspension was lifted and thus declined to lift his interim suspension (at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">45 The three English decisions show that dishonesty is taken seriously by the English medical profession. The doctors in <span class="font-italic">Jasinarachchi </span>and <span class="font-italic">Amit </span>were given suspensions only because in the former case, it appeared to be an isolated incident motivated by the doctor’s personal convenience and in the latter because it was mitigated by the general high regard for the doctor within the medical practice, and his clear remorse for his actions. The strong attitude against dishonesty is better exemplified in <span class="font-italic">Sandler</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where Nicol J declined to terminate the doctor’s interim suspension order in the interests of upholding the reputation of the medical profession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">46 We bore in mind that the English decisions were decided in the context of the English framework, where the maximum term of suspension that could be imposed on errant doctors is 12 months, whereas our sentencing framework empowers the DT as well as the court to suspend an errant doctor for up to three years. Even then, and despite the presence of mitigating factors, the sentences imposed in England have been consistently higher than they have been here. In our judgment, it would be appropriate to use the full range of the sentencing powers to ensure that these are commensurate with the gravity of the offence, and there is no reason to shy away from exercising this power where necessary. Indeed, the 2010 legislative changes envisage this and they were crafted to achieve this end. <span class="font-italic">The 11 January 2010 Debate </span>at cols 1899–1901 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">Second, we propose to expand the range of orders for SMC, its Complaints Committees, Disciplinary Tribunals and Health Committees so as to grant them more powers to be able to deal more effectively and appropriately with errant doctors. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">Under the current Medical Registration Act, the Disciplinary Committee can impose a financial penalty not exceeding $10,000 on a medical practitioner who is convicted. The next level of penalty is a suspension of between three months and three years. There is, therefore, a significant gap in the range of penalties in the current Act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">The new section 53 will allow the Tribunal to impose a fine of up to $100,000, thereby enabling the Tribunal to mete out a penalty that is appropriate to the severity of the case. This section will also allow the Disciplinary Tribunal to impose other orders … The SMC … can thus impose appropriate conditions or restrictions on the practitioner. … All this enhances the powers of the Tribunal by expanding the array of possible orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">47 Hence, while the English cases can be a guide, sentencing in our context must be developed with due reference to the applicable framework here. Aside from this, however, we note that the same attitude abhorring dishonest practice may be found in Singapore. The Applicant’s Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines (“the Code”), which are to be used by doctors as a “yardstick for their own conduct and behaviour” (see part 3 of the Code), states that a doctor is expected to “[m]aintain the highest standards of moral integrity and intellectual honesty” and “[t]reat patients with honesty, dignity, respect and consideration”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">48 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Low Cze Hong v Singapore Medical Council</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 612 at [36] and [88], V K Rajah JA remarked:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">36 In the same vein, this approach applies with equal force to the medical profession under the supervision of the SMC. The importance of maintaining the highest level of professionalism and ethical conduct has been duly acknowledged by the SMC in the Introduction section of the SMC Ethical Code (at p 1):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">The medical profession has always been held in the highest esteem by the public, who look to their doctors for the relief of suffering and ailments. In modern medical practice, patients and society at large expect doctors to be responsible both to individual patients’ needs as well as to the needs of the larger community. Much trust is therefore endowed upon doctors to do their best by both. <span class="font-italic">This trust is contingent on the profession maintaining the highest standards of professional practice and conduct.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">88 <span class="font-italic">The medical profession is a historically venerated institution. Its hallowed status is founded upon a bedrock of unequivocal trust and a presumption of unremitting professional competence.</span> The basic premise underpinning the doctor and patient relationship is that all medical practitioners will infallibly discharge their duties in the time-honoured and immaculate traditions of this singularly noble profession … [E]rrant conduct must be painstakingly policed and <span class="font-italic">effectively deterred </span>if the medical profession is to continue to rightfully occupy its unique position in society. All it needs is a few recalcitrant practitioners to diminish the stature and standing of a revered and respected institution. The SMC plays a pivotal role in ensuring that it does not. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">49 In our judgment, the improper issuance of a false death certificate based on non-existent medical records goes against the very essence of these standards and constitutes a very serious breach of the Code. This is seriously aggravated if the doctor then fabricates or conjures up records in an attempt to justify the false certification. In this case, the element of dishonesty was scarcely accounted for by the DT when it held that it led to the crossing of the threshold from a mere censure or a fine to a suspension.

</div> This was overly lenient to the point of being wrong in principle. It is out of line with Sir Donald Irvine’s suggested approach of erasure from the medical register as a starting point before adjusting for proportionality (see [38] above). It is also out of line with the approach we take to dishonest lawyers who are invariably struck off the rolls regardless of the mitigating circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh and another </span>[2015] 3 SLR 829 at [77]. Additionally, the Respondent displayed his lack of contrition and repentance before us at the oral hearing, when he continued to justify his improper certification of Patient A and B’s deaths despite the overwhelming evidence against him (see [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">50 In <span class="font-italic">Cheatle v General Medical Council </span>[2009] EWHC 645 (Admin) at [33], which followed <span class="font-italic">Bolton v Law Society </span>[1994] 1 WLR 512, it was held that sanctions in medical disciplinary proceedings serve two functions: first, to ensure that the offender does not repeat the offence; and second, to uphold the standing of the medical profession. With respect to the former, we considered that the ultimate aim is to ensure that the public is protected from the potentially severe outcomes arising from the actions of errant doctors (see <span class="font-italic">Council for the Regulation of Health Care Professionals v General Medical Council and Ruscillo </span>[2005] 1 WLR 717 at [60]). We take this opportunity to lay down some principles as to the basis on which we imposed the sentence on the Respondent, and trust that they will guide future DTs in sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">51 We begin with the observation that the concept of public interest which guides sentencing of medical misconduct extends further than just the danger which the doctor may pose to his patients. In <span class="font-italic">Dr Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Nwogbo v General Medical Council</span> [2012] EWHC 2666 (Admin) (“<span class="font-italic">Nwogbo</span>”), Davies J when considering the FPP’s observations said at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">It is clear from the determination of the panel that they had proper regard to the guidance contained in the indicative guidance sanctions promulgated by the GMC in 2009. They recorded, correctly, that the purpose of sanction is protection, not punishment, and that there has to be a proportionate balancing of the interests of the public with those of the doctor. They accepted, correctly, that this was not a case where the appellant posed a risk to patients, but <span class="font-italic">they also observed, rightly, that the public interest is wider than the protection of patients and extends to other matters as well.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">52 In our judgment, public interest considerations weighed heavily in favour of imposing a stern sentence in this case. The issuance of a false death certificate is a very grave breach of a doctor’s ethical and professional duties. The Coroners Act (Cap 63A, 2012 Rev Ed) requires that certain types of unexplained deaths be inquired into by the Coroner. This requirement serves several important functions. From a legal standpoint, it is a vital safeguard against the possibility of homicides being covered up. It may also be important in determining liability in civil lawsuits – in cases of malpractice, for instance – or for the settlement of certain kinds of insurance claims. From a public health standpoint, it serves a critical function. When an otherwise healthy person dies, it is important that society understands why that has happened so that mistakes may be avoided, lessons may be learnt, and possible sources of disease and infection may be discovered and guarded against. From a personal standpoint, not knowing the true cause of the death of a loved one can cause great anguish and confusion for the bereaved family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">53 The following passage from Serene Ai Kiang Ong and Siang Hui Lai, “Certification of Death in Singapore” (2014) 23(4) Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare 292 at p 292 is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">The role of death certificates is generally two-fold: legal and statistical. They could be used for medicolegal, insurance, and inheritance matters. At the same time, the information recorded within constitutes essential epidemiological data for national mortality and morbidity statistics, which ultimately affects health-related decisions such as governmental policies and funding. It is thus essential that the information entered on the certificate must be accurate, yet studies from elsewhere have found error rates as high as 60%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">54 Because of the severity of the potential consequences, we were deeply disturbed by this case. The Respondent issued two death certificates that he later admitted were false. This is not including the matters covered by the Prior Charge. In an attempt to substantiate his lies, he went so far as to claim the existence of extensive medical records and the conduct of treatment and investigations which, upon investigation, proved to be entirely false. For these reasons, we were satisfied that public interest considerations weighed heavily in favour of significantly increasing the sanction to be imposed on the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">55 Second, we also had regard to the considerations of general and specific deterrence. These were elaborated upon by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]–[32] and [34]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">… Deterrence, as a concept, has a multi-faceted dimension and it is inappropriate to invoke it without a proper appreciation of how and when it should be applied. <span class="font-italic">It is premised upon the upholding of certain statutory or public policy concerns or alternatively, upon judicial concern or disquiet about the prevalence of particular offences and the attendant need to prevent such offences from becoming contagious. Deterrence, as a general sentencing principle, is also intended to create an awareness in the public and more particularly among potential offenders that punishment will be certain and unrelenting for certain offences and offenders.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">32 Deterrence however also has a more specific application. <span class="font-italic">Specific deterrence is directed at persuading a particular offender from contemplating further mischief. This assumes that a potential offender can balance and weigh consequences before committing an offence</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">34 In sentencing a particular offender, both general and specific deterrence must be scrupulously assessed and measured in the context of that particular factual matrix before deciding exactly how and to what extent each should figure in the equation. ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">56 In our judgment, the facts of this case amply warranted the application of both these considerations. The Respondent’s actions not only led to an erosion of public trust in the medical profession, but also had serious implications and consequences for the family of the deceased persons. In addition, as we have noted above, it would also potentially have an impact on public health, including the work of medical statisticians, and even possibly criminal investigations when homicides might be covered up or investigations hampered. In the light of the wider consequences of his actions, we considered that general deterrence was applicable as a sentencing principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">57 We were also satisfied that specific deterrence, which is directed at discouraging an offender from contemplating further mischief, was applicable here. The facts showed that when the Respondent committed the acts leading to the Charges, he was being investigated for the acts leading to the Prior Charge. Yet, he went ahead to certify two other deaths without basis or substantiation. His attitude was reckless and callous. Together with his seeming lack of remorse and attempts at justifying his actions, the Respondent did not seem to realise the wrongfulness of his actions. We therefore considered that the principles of general and specific deterrence are applicable in this instance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">58 We turn to the mitigating factors raised by the Respondent at the proceedings below. In this regard, DTs are primarily concerned with the protection of public confidence and the reputation of the profession. For this reason, mitigating circumstances which weigh in favour of an offender in criminal proceedings are viewed in a qualitatively different light where disciplinary proceedings are concerned. <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tha</span><span class="font-italic">m Yu Xian Rick </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 68 at [22], cited by this court in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Kurubalan s/o Manickam Rengaraju</span> [2013] 4 SLR 91 at [48], held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">... Because orders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive, considerations which would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less effect on the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in criminal cases … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">59 Here, the Respondent urged the DT to consider that: (a) he is an undischarged bankrupt and no one would employ him after the Charges were brought against him;

</div> we were unable to give those factors any weight. In our judgment, the interests of protecting public confidence and the reputation of the medical profession outweighed any mitigating value that the Respondent’s voluntary work could give him because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a)  the offences committed by the Respondent were serious ones with potentially damaging consequences; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(b) the Respondent was brazen and his acts of dishonesty were indefensible;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(c) he attempted to cover up his wrongdoing; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(d) he persisted in this conduct despite already facing the Prior Charge; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(e) he displayed a lack of remorse that was evident in the position he took before us (see [27] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Considering his lack of insight into the wrongfulness of his actions, public confidence in and the reputation of the medical profession would not have been adequately protected if the Respondent were given a lighter sentence on the basis of the mitigating circumstances raised, even if we were to accept these as true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">60 <span class="font-italic">Nwogbo</span> is instructive in this regard. The doctor had been charged with an offence of assault pertaining to domestic violence in the presence of a child, and had an obligation to inform the General Medical Council without delay of this (at [12]). He failed to do so, and repeatedly sought and obtained employment from various medical establishments without disclosing his charge, and subsequently, his conviction. The FPP found that the doctor displayed dishonest conduct, and erased his name from the medical register, and at the same time suspended him pending the erasure coming into effect (at [5]). The doctor appealed, and the court observed that there was evidence that he had completely failed to accept his offending, face up to his criminal behaviour, or express any regret or remorse for his conduct which involved elements of dishonesty. It was held that those were factors which pointed to the FPP’s decision being an appropriate one, and the court declined to vary the FPP’s decision (at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">61 In all the circumstances, we considered that a suspension of 18 months for each Charge was appropriate, and that these should run consecutively for an aggregate suspension term of three years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">62 We would also add that the Respondent could well have been struck off the medical register. However, we declined to order that, because there were too many questions left unanswered at the conclusion of the investigation and the DT proceedings. We touch on these below at [70]–[72] in the hope that in any future cases, matters such as these may be fully resolved. Nevertheless, we should say here that even without the additional information and having regard only to the seriousness of the offence and the patent dishonesty on the part of the Respondent, consideration could have been given to striking the Respondent off the medical register. We did not do so in this case as we would have wanted detailed submissions on the question of whether the usual penalty for dishonesty in professional dealings in the medical profession should be similar or different to that in the legal profession. The Respondent was unrepresented and unreliable in the manner he made submissions; it was evident that we would not get much assistance from him. However, we flag this as an open issue that we will take up on an appropriate occasion in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">63 The DT also erred in relation to several points of law, and we now turn our attention to address those.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consolidating the charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">64 First, the DT considered that the First Charge should have been consolidated with the Prior Charge.

It was not possible for the First Charge to be consolidated with the Prior Charge. On 1 December 2010, the MRA 2004 was repealed and the Amendment Act came into effect, which transitioned the MRA 2004 to its current form – the MRA 2010. Section 41(3) of the Amendment Act states that any inquiry, investigations or proceedings commenced before any DC or Complaints Committee (“CC”) appointed before 1 December 2010 would be governed by the MRA 2004, but any proceeding commenced after that date would be governed by the MRA 2010. The upshot of the legislative changes is that r 23B(1) of the Medical Registration Regulations (Cap 174, R 1, 2000 Rev Ed), which was enacted pursuant to the MRA 2004 and gave power to the DC to join similar disciplinary offences, lapsed on 1 December 2010 (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Teck Hin </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 672 at [27], where it was held that subordinate legislation, unless saved by the repealing enactment, lapses on the repeal of the provisions under which it was made), save for its application to disciplinary proceedings which had been commenced before 1 December 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">66 A CC for the Prior Charge was appointed before 1 December 2010,

</div> The MRA 2010 therefore applied to the proceedings concerning the First Charge while the MRA 2004 applied to those concerning the Prior Charge. There was thus no possibility that the proceedings could have been joined. The DT therefore erred in holding otherwise. Consequently, the basis on which the DT ordered that the Respondent serve the two sentences concurrently and pay only half of the Applicant’s costs was wrong and fell aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prior Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">67 Second, the DT erred in considering that the Respondent was not a repeat offender on the basis that he had not yet been <span class="font-italic">sentenced</span> for the Prior Charge when he committed the two acts of misconduct leading to the Charges. The DT reasoned that the sentence should not be stiffer than that imposed for the Prior Charge, which was primarily a three-month suspension. In our judgment, the DT was wrong. It is important to note that while the Respondent had not yet been formally charged with the Prior Charge when he falsely certified Patients A and B’s death certificates, he <span class="font-italic">was</span> on notice that he was under investigation for the prior offence. We considered this to be an aggravating factor and therefore took this into account when imposing the sentences we have set out at [61] above. In any event, it was not evident to us how the Respondent could not be regarded as a repeat offender since the plain facts were that he had repeatedly issued false death certificates. There was simply no ambiguity in this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondent’s guilty pleas</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">68 Third, the DT erred in placing emphasis on the Respondent’s plea of guilt as a mitigating factor. While the court will account for a plea of guilt in mitigation as evidence of remorse, its relevance and weight will depend on the facts (<span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 361 at [10]–[17]). In particular, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) said at [14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">14 In making these comments, I do not dissent from the principle applied by the Senior District Judge that the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their<span style="color: rgba(31,31,31,1)"> </span>relevance<span style="color: rgba(31,31,31,1)"> </span>and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. <span class="font-italic">I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">69 In our judgment, the facts before us clearly fell within the latter category referred to by Chan J. When the Respondent pleaded guilty, the evidence against him was overwhelming and there was no way in which he could possibly have justified his actions. It was on that basis that the Respondent pleaded guilty, and thus the mitigation value was minimal. Indeed, of greater relevance was the fact that the Respondent had initially maintained the position in relation to the Second Charge that he was entirely justified in issuing the death certificate in that case, and had produced what purported to be a letter from D, and further that before us, he maintained that the medical documents that would have substantiated his claim did in fact exist but were just not before us (see [27] above). This was despite the fact that the Respondent had previously admitted that they had been fabricated. We did not believe these were the actions of a remorseful person. In our judgment, his guilty pleas had no value as a mitigating factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our thoughts on the Applicant’s investigations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">70 Finally, we make some observations on the investigations that had been carried out by the Applicant. Having looked at the evidence and heard the parties, we found that there were many questions left unanswered and many difficulties unresolved. First, what was the incentive for the Respondent to falsely certify the deaths of both Patients A and B? The Respondent is a doctor with many years of experience and as much as he might claim to be untrained in death certification, there was nothing unclear about why it was wrong to do what he did. He could not possibly have been unaware of the gravity and consequences of his actions. In investigations of this nature, we thought that it would be obvious that one of the most important questions to be answered was <span class="font-italic">why</span> the acts had been carried out. The motivations behind such acts would undoubtedly be an important factor in determining the sentence to be meted out against an errant doctor. The consequences might have been quite different depending on whether he had done it to conceal some other illicit act, for profit, or for some other less egregious reasons such as sympathy for a bereaved family. We asked the Applicants’ counsel, Mr Philip Fong Yeng Fatt, if this had been looked into, and he told us it had not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">71 Second, we thought that the circumstances surrounding the Respondent’s explanation to the Applicant in relation to the Second Charge were highly suspicious. As mentioned at [16] above, the Respondent had attached what purported to be a letter from D dated 10 December 2011

</div> together with his explanation to the Applicant regarding the cause of Patient B’s death. We found the circumstances surrounding what appeared to be D’s letter and its contents extremely odd to say the least. They gave rise to the following unanswered questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a) How did D know that the Respondent was being investigated and what were the circumstances in which he had written the letter? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(b) D was Patient B’s husband and unless relations between them were very bad, how could he have been so mistaken as to his wife’s medical condition?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(c) Why did D falsely state that C was not the sister of his wife? On the other hand, if C was not the sister of Patient B, why did the Respondent admit to that fact in the Agreed Statement of Facts?

If D had typed the letter, why would he not type his name on the letter before printing it out and then signing on it? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 justify-content-center">(f) In all the circumstances, was the letter genuine, and had it in fact been issued by D, Patient B’s widower?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">72 Our impression formed from reviewing the record of the oral hearing and the papers was that these questions were not asked during investigations. It could be that this was because the Respondent had pleaded guilty to the Charges. In our judgment, the fact that the Respondent had pleaded guilty to the Charges did nothing to quell the concerns that give rise to these questions which ought to have been investigated. Answers to these questions could have given us greater insight into the true culpability of the Respondent and this would have been relevant to sentencing. As we have noted above, had more information been available, we might have found that there were ample grounds for the Respondent to be struck off the medical register even on the basis of the existing sentencing framework without taking into account the point mentioned at [62] above. But as there was no evidence before us as to the matters we have outlined above, we proceeded to sentence him based solely on the facts that we were presented with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">73 However, we remain disturbed by these unresolved issues, and have therefore referred the matter to the Attorney-General to consider what, if any, further steps should be taken to investigate this matter. In our judgment, in future investigations, those leading these inquiries, including those prosecuting these matters, should endeavour to seek answers pertaining to such crucial questions, such as the motivations behind the commission of the offences. Where a plea of guilt is taken, the answers to such questions should be reflected in the agreed statement of facts to the extent they might have a bearing on the appropriate sentence. Apart from ensuring that the sentence is then imposed with the benefit of as complete a picture as possible as to the culpability of the errant doctor, consideration can also be given to any other steps that may need to be taken to ensure that vital interests that are adversely impacted, including those mentioned in the context of this case (see [52] above), the administration of criminal justice and the interests of public health, are attended to. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">74 For these reasons, we set aside the sentence of three months suspension for each Charge, and instead imposed a term of suspension of 18 months for each Charge. We ordered that both sentences are to run consecutively, thus giving rise to an aggregate term of suspension of three years. We were informed, though only after the hearing, that the Respondent had already served the sentence of three months suspension that had earlier been imposed by the DT. It is appropriate that this should be taken into account, leaving him to serve the remaining period of suspension of 33 months commencing on 6 July 2015, the date on which we delivered our judgment. We also ordered that the Applicant should have its full costs and expenses of and incidental to the  inquiry  before  the  DT,  including  the  costs  of  its solicitors.
