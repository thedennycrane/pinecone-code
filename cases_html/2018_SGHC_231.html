The defendant (“Technik-Soil”), is in the business of general construction work and wholesale trade.  On 28 October 2010, Sea-Shore and Technik-Soil entered into an agreement (“the Service Agreement”) for Technik-Soil to rent approximately 10,000 sq ft of storage space at Sea-Shore’s premises to store Technik-Soil’s equipment for a monthly rent of $7,490. The parties do not dispute that the terms of the Service Agreement governed the relationship between them, and that Technik-Soil owed Sea-Shore arrears of rent totalling $266,110 (as of 30 September 2014) (“the Debt”).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In November 2014, after the parties had exchanged various correspondence regarding the repayment of the Debt, including several letters of demand by Sea-Shore, Sea-Shore proceeded to dispose of the equipment which Technik-Soil had stored at Sea-Shore’s premises for a net sum of $40,000, and applied this $40,000 towards the partial discharge of the Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In January 2015, Sea-Shore commenced this suit against Technik-Soil to claim the remaining unpaid rent of $226,110 for Technik-Soil’s rental of Sea-Shore’s premises to store its goods. In turn, Technik-Soil counterclaimed in tort for conversion, detinue and negligence, as well as for breach of contract, alleging that Sea-Shore had sold or removed the goods it had stored at Sea-Shore’s premises without its consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Sea-Shore subsequently applied for judgment on admission. When this application was heard, Technik-Soil did not dispute that it owed the Debt. As such, on 11 May 2018, I entered judgment for Sea-Shore in the sum of $226,110 (after deducting the $40,000 which Sea-Shore had obtained from selling Technik-Soil’s equipment). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The trial thus proceeded only on Technik-Soil’s counterclaim. Technik-Soil claimed that it had stored a vast number of equipment on Sea-Shore’s premises, far in excess (in quantity and value) of the equipment that Sea-Shore had disposed of. At the conclusion of the trial, I found Sea-Shore liable in tort for conversion as it had no right to sell Technik-Soil’s equipment to discharge the outstanding Debt. However, I found that Technik-Soil failed to prove its allegations about the quantity and value of the equipment that was the subject of the conversion, and awarded Technik-Soil $60,000 in total as damages. Technik-Soil has since appealed against my decision, and I now give the full grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sea-Shore’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Balan’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Balan Vijayarahavan Pillai (“Balan”), the Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of Sea-Shore, testified on its behalf.

At the time of the trial, Balan was managing Sea-Shore’s operations, including its storage business. Sea-Shore’s premises located at No 14 Pioneer Sector 2 (“the Premises”) comprised of one building surrounded by a large fenced-up open yard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Service Agreement was signed by Deen on Sea-Shore’s behalf and by Shin Young Kyun (“Shin”) for Technik-Soil. It was undisputed that Technik-Soil ceased to pay the monthly rent from July 2011 onwards.

In a letter to Sea-Shore dated 26 April 2013 (“2013 Letter”), Shin asked Deen for more time to make payment, explaining that Technik-Soil was facing financial difficulties. In this letter, Technik-Soil requested that it be given until 31 May 2013 to relocate its equipment, failing which Sea-Shore could “scrap sale off [Technik-Soil’s] equipment”.

He did not inform Technik-Soil of this disposal at that time, as he was of the view that it had been given adequate notice by way of Sea-Shore’s 3rd Demand Letter and that Technik-Soil itself had acknowledged Sea-Shore’s right to scrap sell the equipment in Technik-Soil’s 2013 Letter.

As part of its business operations, it required storage space for its equipment when not deployed for use, and hence it entered into the Service Agreement with Sea-Shore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 After entering into the Service Agreement, Technik-Soil proceeded to relocate a total of 198 units of various equipment from its previous storage location at Jalan Papan to the Premises between 29 October and 2 November 2010 (“the Relocated Equipment”). Shin claimed that the Relocated Equipment was missing from the Premises between November 2014 and January 2015.

Nevertheless, Deen allowed Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment at the Premises and to pay the rent later. In 2013, in the midst of negotiations on the outstanding rent, Technik-Soil agreed to Sea-Shore’s request that it relocate its equipment.  Technik-Soil notified Sea-Shore of its agreement by way of the 2013 Letter, requesting at the same time for more time to arrange for the relocation. As Technik-Soil could not find an alternative storage location in time, Shin claimed that Deen subsequently agreed to allow Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment on the Premises on the condition that Technik-Soil made partial payment of the outstanding rent. It was not disputed that Technik-Soil made three payments totalling $20,000 in June and July 2013 as partial repayment of its rent arrears

</div> and that Sea-Shore continued to allow Technik-Soil to store its equipment at the Premises. From August 2013 to October 2014, Shin continued to assure Deen that the outstanding rent would be paid in due course. Deen was sympathetic to Technik-Soil’s situation and was prepared to defer the payment of its outstanding rent while allowing Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment at the Premises. Hence, Shin was surprised to receive the 1st and 2nd Demand Letters. Technik-Soil then wrote to Sea-Shore with a counter-proposal on 17 October 2014, which Sea-Shore responded with the 3rd Demand Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 22 October 2014, Deen acceded to Technik-Soil’s request to store additional equipment at the Premises.

He discovered more equipment missing when he returned to the Premises on 28 November and 15 December 2014. By 13 January 2015, Shin found that all of the Relocated Equipment and the Additional Equipment had completely disappeared. On 8 January 2015, Technik-Soil’s lawyers wrote to Sea-Shore to inform them of the missing equipment. On 16 January 2015, Sea-Shore’s lawyers replied to say that Sea-Shore had disposed of Technik-Soil’s equipment to settle Technik-Soil’s rent arrears.

Yet, it was not until Mr Kamil, Sea-Shore’s counsel, highlighted this discrepancy in cross-examination that Shin tried to explain the discrepancy. The Checklist, which Shin had consistently maintained was “100% accurate” had clearly reflected the pumps as being of models JP600 and JP800 (and not JP300), and it was signed <span class="font-italic">and countersigned</span> by Shin and his son.

</div>, and Technik-Soil had scant evidence to show that all the Relocated Equipment it was claiming for remained on the Premises until October 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The crucial evidentiary gap here was that Technik-Soil did not keep any contemporaneous records showing what equipment was moved out of and back into the Premises. Shin claimed that among the Relocated Equipment, only certain specific items had been moved out of and into the Premises between November 2010 and October 2014. These movements were purportedly evidenced by “Machine Out and Return Situation” documents (“MOR documents”) recording the movement of specific pieces of equipment on specified dates to and from specified locations.

However, the transportation invoices did not show what equipment was carried on the vehicles. It is unclear how Shin could, simply relying on the transportation invoices, recall that a particular piece of equipment was moved from and to the Premises on specified dates, when many of the invoices dated back to 2011 and 2012.

</div> It was not until he allegedly discovered one of the two remaining drills missing on 15 December 2014 that he lodged a police report on 24 December 2014.

Shin purportedly first discovered missing items barely five days after Sea-Shore’s 3rd Demand Letter; one would have thought that given the contemporaneity of the 3rd Demand Letter, Technik-Soil would have immediately replied to remonstrate with Sea-Shore regarding the loss of its equipment, but it did not. Notably, Sea-Shore had sent three demand letters in October 2014 (including the 3rd Demand Letter) well before Technik-Soil finally made its police report on 24 December 2014 and wrote to Sea-Shore on 8 January 2015 regarding the allegedly missing equipment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Although Shin claimed that he had confronted Deen on each occasion shortly after discovering that equipment was missing, Technik-Soil did not call Deen to support its claim.

In that case, the defendant-hirers of a tractor complained that the plaintiff (which had brought the suit claiming for hire arrears) had failed to mitigate its damage by not repossessing the tractor. The court observed that, by making such a submission, the defendants appeared to be “cocking a snook” against the plaintiff, since it was the defendants who were in possession of the tractor and who had failed to disclose its whereabouts to the plaintiff. In the present case, the very existence of the goods on the Premises at the material time was in dispute and Technik-Soil had not shown me that all of the Equipment claimed were present at the Premises at the material time, much less that Sea-Shore had disposed of them or that they had gone missing due to Sea-Shore’s act or omission. All that was shown, from Sea-Shore’s evidence, was that Technik-Soil had <span class="font-italic">some</span> equipment at the Premises in November 2014 and that these had been scrap sold by Sea-Shore (see [47] and [48] below).

This would have been well within Technik-Soil’s ability to prove and it was incumbent on Technik-Soil to keep proper and complete records of the movement of its equipment in and out of the Premises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the round, I found that the only pieces of equipment belonging to Technik-Soil which were at the Premises at the material time were the items that Sea-Shore had sold to Metal Recycle, as reflected in Metal Recycle’s PO.

Consideration was furnished through Sea-Shore’s forbearance to scrap sell its equipment until that date (“the Purported Scrap Sale Agreement”).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Mr Kamil relied on <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim</span> [2010] 3 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>”) to show that Sea-Shore had accepted Technik-Soil’s offer contained in the 2013 Letter by conduct. In <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>, acceptance by conduct was demonstrated by the plaintiff’s forbearance to sue and the plaintiff’s reply letter to the defendant. The plaintiff had evinced an intention to sue the defendant, and the defendant thereafter promised to pay the plaintiff what was owing to him (“the defendant’s offer”). The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff had accepted the defendant’s offer by refraining from commencing legal proceedings and that this was evidenced by a subsequent letter from the plaintiff to the defendant accepting the defendant’s offer. Hence a valid, fresh contract had been entered into between the parties and there was sufficient consideration through the plaintiff’s forbearance to sue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The present case was distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>. To begin with, the formation of a contract is assessed objectively and a party’s acceptance of a contract must be sufficiently clear and unequivocal (<span class="font-italic">Compaq Computer Asia Pte Ltd v Computer Interface (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 316 at [36]; <span class="font-italic">Midlink </span><span class="font-italic">Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at [48]–[52]). Whilst Technik-Soil may have, in the 2013 Letter, stated that Sea-Shore could scrap sell the equipment if Technik-Soil could not relocate them by 31 May 2013, there was no evidence that Sea-Shore had accepted this proposal. Sea-Shore did not reply to the 2013 Letter and its conduct in allowing Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment at the Premises until 31 May 2013 is equivocal. Even without an agreement, Sea-Shore could simply allow Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment with rent accruing, as indeed happened until November 2014. Moreover, as Sea-Shore did not have a right to scrap sell the equipment in the first place (other than its reliance on the 2013 Letter), its forbearance to scrap sell cannot be consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Sea-Shore did not point to any correspondence after the 2013 Letter in which the Purported Scrap Sale Agreement was reached. None of the demand letters that Sea-Shore sent in 2014 referred to the Purported Scrap Sale Agreement. Even after Technik-Soil’s lawyers wrote to Sea-Shore’s lawyers on 8 January 2015 to inform Sea-Shore that its equipment was missing from the Premises and that Sea-Shore should return Technik-Soil’s equipment failing which Technik-Soil would commence legal proceedings, Sea-Shore’s lawyers’ reply on 16 January 2015 made no mention whatsoever of this Purported Scrap Sale Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Indeed, the Purported Scrap Sale Agreement (and any acceptance by conduct of the 2013 Letter) was inconsistent with Sea-Shore’s subsequent conduct. Not only did it not proceed to scrap sell Technik-Soil’s equipment after May 2013, it continued to allow Technik-Soil to store its equipment at the Premises for well over another year (while charging further rental). I accepted Shin’s evidence that Deen had agreed to allow Technik-Soil to continue storing its equipment at the Premises on condition that Technik-Soil made some partial repayments to the outstanding rent, which Technik-Soil did in June and July 2013. Hence, going by Shin’s evidence, the initial plan to relocate the equipment outside the Premises (and hence to give Sea-Shore the right to scrap sell the equipment if Technik-Soil failed to do so by 31 May 2013) was no longer afoot. As Balan confirmed, Sea-Shore did not immediately order a scrap sale of Technik-Soil’s equipment even in June and July 2013 because Technik-Soil had made the three payments totalling $20,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Balan also admitted that even after the 1st Demand Letter in October <span class="font-italic">2014</span> (in which Sea-Shore’s right to scrap sell was not raised), Sea-Shore continued to allow Technik-Soil to store its equipment at the Premises.

</div> Technik-Soil’s request on 17 October 2014 for an extension of time to pay did not acknowledge or accept that Sea-Shore had a right to dispose of its equipment in satisfaction of the outstanding rent, and Sea-Shore did not re-assert its right of sale in the 3rd Demand Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The evidence above showed, on balance, that the Purported Scrap Sale Agreement was never formed in 2013 and, even if it were, that the parties had subsequently conducted themselves in a manner that suggested that they no longer intended to be bound by it.

I stress that the converted equipment is limited to those listed on Metal Recycle’s PO, since I found that Technik-Soil failed to prove that there were other pieces of equipment at the Premises at the material time. Technik-Soil’s claim in detinue substantially overlaps with its claim in conversion, but its claim for relief for delivery up of its equipment is no longer available as whatever equipment remained at the Premises at the material time has been sold off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In its closing submissions, Technik-Soil no longer relied on a claim for breach of contract. I also did not have to consider whether Sea-Shore had a duty to look after Technik-Soil’s equipment stored at the Premises; Mr Magintharan agreed that this issue would not arise if I was not satisfied that any of Technik-Soil’s equipment (apart from the equipment sold to Metal Recycle) was missing as it claimed.

Sea-Shore does not admit that any of the equipment listed by Shin and valued in Mario’s report correspond to the equipment that Sea-Shore sold. Sea-Shore called Mohamed Ali B Darius (“Mohamed Ali”) as its valuer. Mohamed Ali merely opined that Mario’s report did not comply with the International Valuation Standards (“IV Standards”) for valuing assets as no physical inspection of the assets were carried out and Mario had simply assumed that the equipment was operational when he valued them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The measure of damages is essentially the market value of the converted equipment at the date of conversion or the cost of replacing the converted equipment (<span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport </span><span class="font-italic">Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 at [28]–[33]). However, in proving its entitlement to damages, Technik-Soil must show both the fact of damage and its amount, and there must be sufficient evidence of the quantum of loss suffered even if Technik-Soil would otherwise have been entitled to such quantum (<span class="font-italic">Biofuel Industries Pte Ltd v V8 Environmental Pte Ltd</span> [2018] SGCA 28 at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 If it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage is ordinarily no reason to award no damages or merely nominal damages. In <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623, the Court of Appeal accepted that the proof of damage requires a flexible approach, with different occasions calling for different evidence with regard to certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the case and the nature of the damages claimed (at [30]). Where the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its loss and the evidence is cogent, the court should allow recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Such guidance is readily applicable where uncertainty is inherent in the nature of the damages sought; for instance, where the head of damages involves postulating about the effects of a counterfactual scenario, isolating the effects of the tortious cause, or postulating about the future. But the difficulty before me is a different one: uncertainty surrounds the very <span class="font-italic">identity</span> of the equipment to be valued, and its<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">nature and condition</span>. Technik-Soil faced difficulty in even identifying what items of equipment were converted in the first place, and this was largely due to the fact it had failed to keep proper records of what equipment was at the Premises at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At first blush, the difficulty faced by Technik-Soil (in identifying what equipment had been converted by Sea-Shore and in proving the condition and value of such equipment) appeared to be the result of Sea-Shore’s wrongful sale of the equipment. This would appear to trigger the maxim <span class="font-italic">omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem</span> – that everything is presumed against the spoiler or wrongdoer. There are authorities that suggest that a person who, having converted property, refuses to produce it such that its exact value may be known is liable for the greatest value that such an article could have (<span class="font-italic">Coldman v Hill</span> [1919] 1 KB 443 at 458; <span class="font-italic">Armory v Delamirie</span> (1722)<span class="font-italic"> </span>1 Stra 505, 93 ER 664) (“the <span class="font-italic">Armory </span>principle”). In modern authorities, the <span class="font-italic">Armory </span>principle has been accepted and restated by the English courts as raising an evidential presumption in the claimant’s favour, giving him the benefit of any relevant doubt where the defendant has made it difficult or impossible for him to adduce relevant evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Browning v </span><span class="font-italic">Brachers</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 753; <span class="font-italic">Glenbrook Capital LP v </span><span class="font-italic">Hamilton</span> [2014] EWHC 2297 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Glenbrook Capital LP</span>”) at [42]–[44]). Likewise, the High Court of Australia has affirmed a principle that “[t]he trial judge … may think it proper to draw inferences in favour of the appellants, if it is concluded that the respondent’s wrong itself made quantification difficult” (<span class="font-italic">Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd </span>[2004] HCA 3 at [74], citing <span class="font-italic">Armory v Delamirie </span>at footnote 48). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Although the authorities do not necessarily speak with one voice on the application of the <span class="font-italic">Armory </span>principle, it is clear that the principle is subject to some qualifications. First, the full rigour of an adverse presumption applies only where a party has intentionally and in bad faith destroyed or refused to produce the subject matter in question so as to prevent the claimant from adducing evidence that could prove his case (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Zab</span><span class="font-italic">ihi v Janzemini &amp; Ors </span>[2009] EWCA 851 (“<span class="font-italic">Zab</span><span class="font-italic">ihi</span>”) <span class="font-italic">per </span>Moore-Bick LJ). Next, it should only apply where the wrongdoer’s acts make it difficult or impossible for the innocent party to prove its loss or where the facts needed to prove the loss are known solely by the wrongdoer and he does not disclose these facts to the innocent party (<span class="font-italic">Ticketnet Corporation v Air Canada</span> (1997) 154 DLR (4th) 271 at [85]–[86]), cited in <span class="font-italic">Bangle v Lafreniere</span>, 2012 BCSC 256 at [38]). Further, any presumption must still be consistent with the rest of the facts of the case and founded on the evidence that has been presented (<span class="font-italic">Colbeck v Diamanta</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd</span> [2002] EWHC 616; <span class="font-italic">Glenbrook Capital LP</span> at [44]; <span class="font-italic">Double G Communications Ltd v News Group International Ltd </span>[2011] EWHC 961<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]). In other words, the <span class="font-italic">Armory </span>principle is not a licence for the court to engage in pure guesswork. Bearing in mind that the identity of the converted equipment is disputed in the present case, I note in particular that in <span class="font-italic">Zab</span><span class="font-italic">ihi</span>, Blackburne J at first instance (whose decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal) declined to apply the <span class="font-italic">Armory </span>principle in its fullest force because it must be “temper[ed]… to the fact that [the claimant was] not able to establish <span class="font-italic">just what the goods were</span>” (emphasis added). It must be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Zab</span><span class="font-italic">ihi</span>, it was not disputed that the plaintiff claimant had handed over certain jewellery to the defendant tortfeasor and had informed the defendant of the price he expected the defendant to sell them for.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 With these qualifications in mind, I was not satisfied that any evidential presumption should be raised against Sea-Shore. There was no evidence that it had wilfully sold the equipment or refused to produce them in order to prevent Technik-Soil from giving evidence. Sea-Shore had believed (albeit erroneously) that it was entitled to sell Technik-Soil’s equipment to discharge the rental arrears that Technik-Soil owed to Sea-Shore. Furthermore, although the sale of Technik-Soil’s equipment has made it difficult for Technik-Soil to prove the condition of the equipment as a physical inspection was no longer possible, it was its responsibility to keep track of the identity of its equipment and their movement into and out of the Premises. Sea-Shore was not obliged to keep an inventory of Technik-Soil’s equipment. The specifications of each equipment were also within Technik-Soil’s knowledge, as evidenced by its ability to particularise details such as the model, make and year of manufacture of some 65 types of equipment (totalling more than 200 units) it claimed for.

On the other hand, a court must not unquestioningly accept unchallenged evidence. Evidence must be weighed and evaluated in the context of the factual matrix and the objective facts, and an expert’s opinion “should not fly in the face of proven extrinsic facts relevant to the matter”. In reality, substantially the same rules apply to the evaluation of expert testimony as they would to other categories of witness testimony (<span class="font-italic">Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 at [76]). Hence, while a judge is not obliged to accept the opinion of an expert, even where there is no contrary opinion, such rejection must be based on sound grounds (<span class="font-italic">Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina and another</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 326 at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the value of the equipment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I first summarise my decision on the quantum of damages before explaining my grounds in detail.

There was no perceptible basis for its assumption that a selected few of its drill rigs and water pumps corresponded to PO Items 1–10 or that the silo tanks and water tank corresponded to PO Items 11–15. This was a fatal flaw because Technik-Soil claimed that even within the same class of equipment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, among the drill rigs),<span class="font-italic"> </span>each particular item differed in make, model, year of manufacture and value, and the range of fair market value (on Technik-Soil’s own case) was wide.

I was unable to accept this method of attribution. The 12 drill rigs were not of the same make, model, capacity or even year of manufacture, and Mario had assigned a different market value to each of them, ranging from $6,000 to $149,000. Without proper documentation of which drill rigs remained on the Premises at the time of the tort (or whether the drill rigs that Sea-Shore had sold were even from the list of the Equipment), Technik-Soil’s approach in randomly selecting six out of 12 drill rigs and making a claim for those drill rigs was arbitrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Next, I had difficulty accepting that certain drill rigs were even present at the Premises at the time of the tort because there was inadequate documentation supporting the acquisition, presence or movement of these drill rigs (including the six assumed to have been the ones converted):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Based on the Checklists, it was doubtful whether Item A2 (auger motor) and Item A3 (11 screw rods) had even arrived at the Premises on 1 November 2010 as Technik-Soil had claimed (see [26] above).

At best they showed the movement of <span class="font-italic">vehicles</span> but not the equipment transported, and documentation was also missing for certain trips to and from the Premises (see [31] above).

There were also no documents to show that Technik-Soil had acquired or leased Item B5. Even if Item B5 was first moved to the Premises on 2 November 2010, it is unclear if (as Shin claimed) Item B5 was transported back to the Premises on 26 July 2012 after it was removed from the Premises on 10 April 2012

Even if six drill rigs must have been on the Premises because they were sold to Metal Recycle, there was no evidence as to which six these were among Technik-Soil’s 12 drill rigs (or whether the six rigs were even from these 12 rigs). Technik-Soil’s documentation of the movement of equipment to and from the Premises was inadequate and the transportation invoices did not state the equipment transported. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Further, even if I were prepared to consider awarding Technik-Soil the <span class="font-italic">minimum</span> value of six drill rigs among its list of 12 drill rigs, I was not prepared to rely on Mario’s valuation, for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no basis for Mario’s assumption that the equipment was operational, as no inspection was done, and he relied only on Technik-Soil’s assertion that they were operational. However, Technik-Soil had not produced any evidence that the equipment was regularly maintained or serviced or any reliable evidence of recent use of the equipment. Based on Technik-Soil’s own case, only two of the 12 drill rigs moved to the Premises (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, drill rigs PX600 and SSD1000) were ever deployed for construction projects and hence there was no evidence that the other 10 were even operational.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mario’s valuation was based on photographs of the equipment provided to him by Technik-Soil. As earlier noted, some of the photographs were dated and could not have provided him with an accurate picture of the condition of the equipment in November 2014.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mario’s ascription of the Base Value of the equipment was sourced from the internet or inquiries with suppliers, but he did not provide supporting documentation so that the Base Value could be verified. Further, even where Technik-Soil had provided evidence of its actual cost of acquisition of a particular equipment, Mario did not utilise that figure. I found this especially problematic for Item B8 (jet grouting machine GT1001), for which the invoice for purchase states that Technik-Soil acquired it at a price of $4,800.

</div> In contrast, Mario obtained a Base Value of $67,317 and a valuation of $43,000 after depreciation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) For several items (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Items B3, B4, B5, B6), Mario was unable to ascertain the year of purchase or manufacture, and Technik-Soil did not supply any documentation of the same. It was thus unclear how Mario could assess the condition of the equipment and the appropriate depreciation value. Even where he specified a year of purchase or manufacture, he admitted that he was making an assumption based on his internet searches on the equivalent model numbers and it was not clear that these particular models were produced in only one production run.

I accepted that there were some weaknesses in Sea-Shore’s evidence of the value of these items. For example, Sea-Shore did not call for an open auction or obtain a valuation from an experienced valuer. Its method of sale was rather more haphazard; in Balan’s words, Sea-Shore simply “invited many people [to view the equipment at the Premises] and took the highest bid”.

</div> Balan did not give evidence about the profile of potential buyers that Sea-Shore invited, such as whether they were all scrap dealers or used machinery dealers. Nonetheless, the value obtained on Sea-Shore’s sale was based on a physical inspection of the equipment’s condition at the time of sale. Sea-Shore adduced photographs showing the condition of some of Technik-Soil’s equipment remaining on site as of August 2014, and Balan explained, using the photographs, why the equipment was not in serviceable condition.

As with the drill rigs (or boring machines as described in Metal Recycle’s PO), Technik-Soil did not identify which pumps Sea-Shore had sold to Metal Recycle. Moreover, Sea-Shore had assumed that this category of items comprised of <span class="font-italic">only</span> grouting and drilling pumps, which is at variance with the description on Metal Recycle’s PO, which refers to “loose maintenance tools” and “accessories” as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Second, I had difficulty accepting that certain pumps were even present at the Premises at the time of the tort:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was unclear from Technik-Soil’s own document whether Item B10 (grouting pump MP7-680S), which it claimed was first removed from the Premises on 20 January 2011 was ever returned to the Premises eventually.

If so, there was again no reliable evidence of which particular silo tanks (from among the five that Technik-Soil claimed to have moved into the Premises or otherwise) corresponded with the four silo tanks in Metal Recycle’s PO.

</div> It was doubtful that all the water tanks had arrived at the Premises on 29 October 2010 (as no corresponding signature or record was made for some of the water tanks entering the Premises) and, in any event, Shin also stated that some items were eventually sold. Ultimately, the Checklist suggested that Technik-Soil had a number of water tanks, but only one was left on the Premises at the time of the tort. It was unclear if the water tanks were generic, and Technik-Soil did not produce any documents to show the specifications or model of the particular water tank that it was making a claim for. Hence there was no factual basis for Mario’s valuation of the water tank. Although Lim Kek Hian of SAM Transportation testified that a vehicle from his company had transported a cement silo and a water tank to the Premises on 25 October 2014,

This is problematic as there is no factual basis to accept Mario’s valuation and also because, as stated above, Technik-Soil’s own Checklist suggested that Technik-Soil owned numerous water tanks at the material time. There was no documentary evidence of the year of purchase or manufacture, or of the dimensions and model of the water tank. Therefore, there was no factual foundation for Mario’s assessment of the water tank’s value and the depreciation value (30%) accorded to the water tank, and I thus rejected the value put forth by Mario. Given the paucity of evidence, I accepted that the price paid by Metal Recycle was the best evidence of the water tank’s value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For the cement silos (Items B28 to B31), Technik-Soil had produced documents evidencing their purchase or lease.

The documentation for Item B28 described the goods as “Cement Silo 50Ton” but it was 70m3 in capacity. Technik-Soil did not adduce evidence of the actual dimensions and capacity (in cubic metres) of Items B30 and B31. There was also no evidence supporting the dimensions and capacity that Mario used to value all the cement silos. Further, as Item B31 was leased in 2010, it was likely to have been manufactured before that date; without evidence of its year of manufacture, it was not possible to reliably assert a depreciation value. In addition, Mario did not apply a consistent method in arriving at the depreciation ratio for the cement silos. Though Item B28 was a year older than Item B30, the asset condition of Item B28 was valued at 35% of the cost of a new cement silo of its specification, whereas the asset condition of Item B30 was valued at 30%. Similarly, though Item B29 and Item B30 were purchased in 2002 and 2006 respectively, the asset condition of both Items B29 and B30 were valued at 30% of the cost of a new cement silo of their respective specifications. Finally, Mario’s valuation of the cement silos suffers from the same general deficiencies observed at [81(a)]–[81(c)] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an unsubstantiated assumption that the silos were in working condition, photographs that were outdated or not probative, and a lack of supporting documents for the Base Value that Mario sourced from the internet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Therefore, I was unable to accept Mario’s assessment of the value of the cement silos. I reiterate that it is for Technik-Soil to prove its loss and the quantum of such loss. Given the state of the evidence, I accepted that the price paid by Metal Recycle for the cement silos was the best evidence of their value.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Given the deficiencies in the evidence presented by Technik-Soil, I accepted that the price paid by Metal Recycle to Sea-Shore was the best evidence of the value of the equipment at the time of conversion. Technik-Soil is entitled to $40,000, the price which Metal Recycle paid for PO Items 1–15. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The PO also states that five “compressor units / hydraulic units” were sold to Metal Recycle for $20,000. In its closing submissions, Technik-Soil asserted that this reference to “compressor units” (which Technik-Soil never owned any of) referred to five units of “turbo mixer plants” in the list of the Equipment.

</div> Its assertion was not supported by any evidence. Sea-Shore’s case is that the items sold to Metal Recycle were found in the area of the Premises designated for Technik-Soil’s equipment and it has credited these items as belonging to Technik-Soil. As the physical existence of the equipment in that designated area was not in doubt (as Balan was present when the equipment was sold to Metal Recycle) and I accepted that the price Metal Recycle paid was the best evidence of the value of the equipment that Technik-Soil had on the Premises at the material time (even if the type of equipment cannot now be determined with certainty), the amount of $20,000 (in Metal Recycle’s PO) paid for this category of equipment should be credited to Technik-Soil.  In any event, Sea-Shore was not making a claim to “re-set” this amount. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Finally, I noted that in the PO, Sea-Shore allowed Metal Recycle a deduction of $20,000 from the total purchase price for transportation and repairs. According to Balan, the repairs were to be carried out on PO Item 6, the boring machine which was stated to be “spoilt”.

</div> The remaining pieces of equipment, according to him, were beyond repair and were to be scrapped, as reflected in the lower value paid for them. For starters, Sea-Shore should not be allowed to claim for any transportation costs against Technik-Soil for Metal Recycle to transport the items that Sea-Shore had wrongfully converted. Second, as Metal Recycle had paid Sea-Shore what the former thought was fair value for the items, it is unclear why it should be allowed to deduct further costs to repair PO Item 6 and how such costs should then be off-set against the price it paid for the items. In any event, such cost should not be borne (ultimately) by Technik-Soil. Hence, no amount should be deducted for transportation and repair costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Accordingly, I awarded Technik-Soil $60,000 in total on its counterclaim. As Sea-Shore had set off $40,000 against the outstanding rent, I ordered a further sum of $20,000 to be paid by it to Technik-Soil, with such sum to be set off against the judgment debt that Technik-Soil owed Sea-Shore in the main claim – Mr Kamil confirmed that Sea-Shore did not object to such set-off.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the final analysis, it must be remembered that Technik-Soil chose to mount its case on the basis that there were 214 units of Equipment on the Premises that Sea-Shore had converted. I had found this to be dubious. Technik-Soil could not in the alternative simply assume certain items of Equipment as the items sold to Metal Recycle when it had not reliably produced evidence of which particular items of equipment (whether from the list of Equipment or otherwise) were actually on the Premises at the material time. Such evidence would have been within Technik-Soil’s possession and knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Kamil submitted that Sea-Shore should be awarded the costs for the application for judgment on admission at $6,000, and 50% of the cost of the action. Mr Magintharan submitted that each party should bear its own costs. I ordered the costs of the application for judgment on admission be awarded to Sea-Shore fixed at $6,000 (inclusive of disbursements) as Sea-Shore had succeeded on that application. I further ordered that each party bear its own costs of the action. Whilst Sea-Shore had succeeded on its claim for the rental arrears (being a straightforward claim), I had found Sea-Shore to be liable in conversion of Technik-Soil’s equipment and thus Technik-Soil had succeeded on its counterclaim, albeit the damages awarded were not substantial.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Nawaz Kamil and Wong Joon Wee (Providence Law Asia LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>S Magintharan, Vineetha Gunasekaran and Tan Xiyun Benedict (Essex LLC) for the defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
