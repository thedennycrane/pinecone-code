<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the defendant husband
                    (“the Husband”) against the district court’s decision to
                    dismiss the Husband’s application for a stay of divorce proceedings filed
                    by the plaintiff wife (“the Wife”) on 26 June 2011 on the ground
                    of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. After hearing the
                    parties, I allowed the appeal on 12 April 2013. I now give the grounds for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Material facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties were married in France in 2000. The
                    parties and their son are French nationals, the Wife having become a French
                    national in 2006. The Husband and the son also have Swedish
                nationality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties presently reside in Singapore,
                    although they are not permanent residents. The Husband currently holds an
                    employment pass in Singapore while the Wife and the son hold dependant passes.
                    Before the parties relocated to Singapore in 2006, they had lived in several
                    different countries where the Husband worked. Of all these countries, the
                    parties have stayed in Singapore for the longest period of time. The son was
                    born in Singapore in 2010 and has resided in Singapore ever since, with a few
                    visits to Paris and Beijing (China).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Prior to their marriage, the parties signed a
                    pre-nuptial agreement in France. This pre-nuptial agreement was not expressly
                    governed by French law, but made numerous references to the French Civil Code.
                    Significantly, the pre-nuptial agreement provided for the maintenance of
                    separate property by each spouse, <em>ie</em>, each spouse
                    was entitled to keep the property that he or she subsequently
                        acquired.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It was not disputed that
                    the parties had no immovable property in Singapore; they only possessed
                    immovable property in France and China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There was some dispute between the parties over
                    their future plans in Singapore. The Husband averred that their stay in
                    Singapore was transient, given the family’s previous trend of relocating
                    to wherever he could secure employment and the fact that the parties were not
                    even Singapore permanent residents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Wife argued
                    that the Husband intended to stay in Singapore, given that he had recently been
                    promoted and had also renewed the family’s respective passes in Singapore.
                    She also expressed her desire to remain and bring up the son in Singapore in the
                    light of their settled routine and social support network here.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There are concurrent divorce proceedings taking
                    place in Singapore and France. The Husband commenced divorce proceedings in
                    France on or about 27 April 2012. The relevant papers for the French proceedings
                    were served on the Wife on 22 June 2012. Meanwhile, the Wife had attempted to
                    commence divorce proceedings in Singapore on 14 June 2012; however the filing
                    was rejected by the court registry due to the lack of specific information. The
                    Wife then re-filed the divorce suit in Singapore on 26 June 2012, after she was
                    served with the Husband’s French divorce papers. Subsequently, the
                    Singapore courts made interim orders on maintenance and custody arrangements: an
                    order for maintenance of the Wife and the son was made in August 2012 (after an
                    original maintenance order made in March 2012 was varied on appeal), while an
                    order granting the Husband interim access to the son was made in July
                        2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Both of these
                    orders were interim orders pending the hearing on ancillary matters in the
                    parties’ divorce proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Husband averred that he had no intention of
                    avoiding the Singapore interim orders, and that the French court hearing the
                    divorce would enforce these orders on maintenance and custody
                        arrangements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    According to the Husband, he had asked the French court to
                    “mirror” the Singapore interim orders and not to take jurisdiction
                    over the son. As such, the only issue that would be raised in France would be
                    the division of matrimonial assets (although the Husband’s French counsel
                    also gave evidence that under French law, maintenance would stop upon
                    pronouncement of the divorce and that the judge would fix a lump-sum
                    compensatory allowance for the poorer spouse).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Husband exhibited a new document from the
                    French court that was not available at the time of the hearing below. On 30
                    November 2012, a Non-Reconciliation Order (“the French NRO”) was
                    issued by the French court pursuant to a hearing attended by both parties on 16
                    October 2012. The French NRO addressed the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The parties’ agreement on the
                        provisional maintenance of the Wife and the son in accordance with the
                        interim order made by the Singapore district court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband was also to pay the
                        Wife an <em>ad litem</em> provision of €10,000 for
                        her legal fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The parties’ agreement to the
                        jurisdiction of the Singapore courts on “parental responsibility and
                        maintenance obligations relating to the child”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The parties’ agreement to the jurisdiction of the
                        French court on the maintenance obligations between the spouses. As for the
                        applicable law on this issue, the French judge determined that French law
                        would apply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Significantly, the French NRO also stated that
                    the parties had agreed to French jurisdiction and to the application of French
                    law to the divorce:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The district judge below dismissed the
                    Husband’s application for a stay of the Singapore divorce proceedings on
                    23 November 2012. The reasons for this decision can be summarised as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The real and connecting factors are
                        in Singapore since the parties are living here with no apparent plans to
                        relocate. Enforcement of maintenance or court orders will hence have to take
                        place in Singapore. Conversely, none of the parties have a real connection
                        with France other than their citizenship. Nationality <em>per
                            se</em> is of limited significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the issue of divorce, all the witnesses
                        pertaining to the Husband’s adultery (<em>eg</em>, the co-defendant, the private investigator) are based in
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Interim orders for custody and maintenance issues have already been made in
                        Singapore, and the Husband has participated in and agreed to abide by these
                        orders. Although the Husband has sought a “mirroring” of the
                        Singapore interim orders in France, this does not mean that the French court
                        will ultimately do so and matters may have to be re-litigated <em>de novo</em>, resulting in a waste of costs and duplicity
                        of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     The fact that the matrimonial properties are situated in China and France
                        is not critical. Singapore courts have consistently dealt with the division
                        of worldwide assets in ancillary hearings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     Similarly, Singapore courts are able to take
                        into account the pre-nuptial agreement in the division of matrimonial
                        assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The applicable test to determine if divorce
                    proceedings should be stayed in Singapore on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is the test enunciated in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC
                    460 (“the <em>Spiliada</em> test”): see
                        <em>VH v VI and another</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 742 and
                        <em>Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla (Danialle An,
                        co-respondent)</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 920 (“<em>Mala Shukla</em>”). The <em>Spiliada</em>
                    test consists of two stages:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>Stage
                            one</b>: The party seeking the stay (<em>ie</em>, the Husband) must show that there is another available
                        forum that is <em>clearly or distinctly more
                            appropriate</em> than Singapore to determine the dispute. The
                        court will take into consideration connecting factors, such as factors
                        affecting convenience or expense (<em>eg</em>,
                        availability of witnesses), the law governing the transaction and the places
                        where the parties reside or carry on business.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>Stage two</b>: If
                        there is another forum which is <em>prima facie</em>
                        more appropriate, the court will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are
                        special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should
                        nevertheless be refused. At this stage, the burden shifts to the plaintiff
                        to show such special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The <em>Spiliada</em>
                    test is essentially a factors-based test; the weight to be placed on the various
                    factors varies with the specific factual matrix of the case (<em>BDA v BDB</em> [2013] 1 SLR 607 (“<em>BDA</em>”) at [24]). In <em>BDA</em>, a
                    case involving maintenance proceedings, it was also noted that the court
                    exercises a discretion in determining whether Singapore is a <em>forum non conveniens</em> and, as such, an appellate court should be
                    slow to interfere unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of
                    principle, or had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken
                    into account, or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have
                    taken into account, or his decision was plainly wrong (<em>BDA</em> at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In a case of <em>lis alibi
                        pendens</em> where there are simultaneous proceedings elsewhere, this
                    is an important factor to be taken into account under the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine, as it raises issues of
                    duplication of resources and conflicting judgments (<em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009)
                        (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at para
                    75.094. In such a case, the choice is between trial in Singapore <em>plus</em> trial abroad (if a stay is refused), and trial
                    abroad (if the stay is granted) (Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett, <em>Private International Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 14th
                    Ed, 2008) at p 55). The weight to be given to the fact of existence of parallel
                    proceedings depends on the circumstances of the case. Some pertinent
                    considerations include the degree of overlap of issues and parties and the
                    degree to which the respective proceedings have been advanced; however, little
                    or no weight will be given to foreign proceedings if they were commenced for
                    strategic reasons (<em>Halsbury’s</em> at para
                    75.094). Thus, the fact that there are existing proceedings in another
                    jurisdiction can be a decisive but not an automatic factor in favour of a stay;
                    all depends on the circumstances of the case (<em>Mala
                        Shukla</em> at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I now turn to apply the <em>Spiliada</em> test to the present facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage 1: Whether France is a more appropriate forum than
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The district judge did not err in finding that
                    the parties’ French nationality was of limited significance and that
                    greater weight should be given to the fact of the parties’ residence in
                    Singapore as a connecting factor. As stated in <em>BDA</em>
                    at [29], nationality <em>per se</em> is of limited
                    significance; residency and/or domicile are better indicators of the strength of
                    a party’s connection to a particular forum. Indeed, the Husband has spent
                    little of his adult life either residing or working in France; the son has also
                    spent very little time on French soil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the parties have
                    lived in Singapore for the last six or seven years. The Wife also stated in her
                    affidavits that she only acquired French citizenship in 2006 in order to visit
                    her in-laws more easily and to oblige the Husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    Thus, in the light of the parties’ residence in Singapore, the Husband had
                    a greater evidential burden to adduce other convincing countervailing factors in
                    favour of a stay (<em>BDA</em> at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the jurisdiction of the court is not
                    based on the nationality and residence of the parties alone; great weight should
                    also be attached to the location of the subject matters in dispute (<em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 851 at
                    [34]). The first task was thus to determine the subject matters in dispute in
                    this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my opinion, the dispute in the present
                    proceedings really revolved around the pre-nuptial agreement. The fact that the
                    Husband’s adultery took place in Singapore and that the evidence on this
                    issue was located in Singapore was not a significant factor. The Husband’s
                    adultery was not a disputed fact; the Husband had expressly acknowledged his
                    relationship with the co-defendant in his affidavits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> In any case, the
                    Wife could adduce (by way of evidence) the private investigators’
                    report in the French proceedings if needed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for the ancillary matters, the
                    Husband’s position seemed to be that the “mirroring”
                    requests made to the French court would dispose of the maintenance and custody
                    issues, such that the only issue open to adjudication by the French court would
                    be the division of matrimonial assets. As this would primarily involve an
                    examination of the pre-nuptial agreement made in France and under French law,
                    France would be a better forum. The Wife conceded that the issues regarding the
                    pre-nuptial agreement should be adjudicated in France<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, but argued that issues pertinent to
                    custody arrangements and maintenance should be heard by the Singapore courts,
                    given that parties are resident here.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife’s assertions were not wholly
                    without merit, given that it was unclear at this stage whether the French court
                    would ultimately uphold the Singapore interim orders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In particular, I also
                    noted that the issue of the Wife’s maintenance might remain an issue
                    before the French court, in the light of the Husband’s own evidence that
                    under French law, the Wife would receive a lump-sum compensatory allowance in
                    lieu of maintenance upon the pronouncement of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Nevertheless, it should be noted that the
                    French court in the French NRO upheld the Singapore interim order on maintenance
                    (albeit provisionally) and also did not take jurisdiction over custody and
                    maintenance issues vis-à-vis the son, stating that there was an agreement
                    between the parties on this matter. Moreover, the Wife’s evidence
                    indicated that parties were mostly in agreement on the custody arrangements for
                    the son (joint custody of the son with care and control to the
                        Wife).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    Conversely, the validity and voluntariness of the pre-nuptial agreement was
                    contested. Presumably, the Wife also contested the Husband’s stay
                    application because the parties believed that the pre-nuptial agreement (which
                    is not favourable to the Wife) would be given greater weight in a French court
                    than in a Singapore court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The pre-nuptial agreement was thus
                    the main subject matter in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     While the district judge was correct to state
                    that pre-nuptial agreements (even those governed by foreign law) could be
                    considered by a Singapore court in the division of matrimonial assets (<em>TQ v TR and another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961), the
                    Wife did acknowledge that the fact that the Singapore courts may be required to
                    rule upon the parties’ pre-nuptial agreement was a pertinent factor in
                    favour of a stay of the Singapore proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Proof of French law would likely be
                    necessary as the pre-nuptial agreement made references to the French Civil Code.
                    Where the Wife contested her voluntariness in signing the pre-nuptial agreement,
                    witnesses in France would also need to be called. As the Wife’s own French
                    counsel conceded, the validity of the pre-nuptial agreement and the competence
                    of the French notary who facilitated its making were not issues for adjudication
                    in the Singapore courts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Although the district judge was also correct
                    in stating that the Singapore courts could deal with the division of worldwide
                    assets in ancillary hearings, some emphasis should also be placed on the fact
                    that the matrimonial properties are located in foreign jurisdictions. For
                    instance, in <em>Mala Shukla</em>, the fact that the
                    parties there had immovable property in India but not Singapore was a pertinent
                    factor in favour of a stay (<em>Mala Shukla</em> at [54]).
                    Similarly here, the fact that the parties have immovable property in France but
                    not Singapore should be a supporting factor for a stay of the Singapore
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As this case involved concurrent divorce
                    proceedings in Singapore and France, the doctrine of <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> came into play as another factor in favour of a
                    stay. The Husband had filed for divorce in France in April 2012; the Wife then
                    commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore on 14 June 2012, although it should
                    be noted that the French papers were only served on her on 22 June 2012 and that
                    she had applied for maintenance of herself and the son in March
                        2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> There was a
                    significant overlap between these two proceedings; both addressed issues
                    relating to the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters, in particular
                    division of matrimonial property. A significant difficulty for the Wife was that
                    she had apparently submitted to the jurisdiction of the French court and its
                    application of French law to the divorce in the proceedings that culminated in
                    the French NRO (see [9] above). This was contrary to her contention before the
                    district judge that she was only entering an appearance and did not submit to
                    the jurisdiction of the French court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Moreover, as pointed out by the
                    Husband, the Wife sought additional relief from the French court in the NRO
                    proceedings, for example, an <em>ad litem</em> provision
                    for her litigation costs in France, the return of her jewellery as well as the
                    appointment of a notary to draw up a plan for the liquidation of the matrimonial
                        regime.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    It thus seemed that the Wife was pursuing concurrent divorce proceedings in
                        <em>both</em> France and Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Looking at the various factors in totality,
                    France was clearly the more appropriate forum to hear this matter. While I
                    agreed with the Wife that the parties’ residence in Singapore favoured the
                    hearing of matters relating to custody of the son and maintenance in Singapore,
                    the other factors in favour of France as the appropriate forum were
                    overwhelming. I was reinforced in my decision by the statements made by Lee Seiu
                    Kin JC in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 993 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In my view it is more important that the same court consider and
                        decide these matters [<em>ie</em>, divorce and
                        ancillary matters such as custody and access] than to divide the issues to
                        be decided in separate courts simply because the assets are in another
                        jurisdiction. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As such, the burden of proof shifted to the
                    Wife to show that this court should nonetheless refuse to exercise its
                    discretion to stay the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage 2: Whether there are special circumstances warranting refusal
                of a stay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Although the Wife made no specific submissions
                    on this issue, some possible arguments as gleaned from her affidavits were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife was prejudiced since she
                        was not fluent in French, the language in which the French proceedings would
                        be conducted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Proceedings in France would be a burden on the Wife, who
                        was financially dependent on the Husband. The need to appear in French court
                        and its related expenses would also impede the Wife’s efforts to find
                        gainful employment in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     Proceedings in France would cut the Wife and the
                        son off from their social networks in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Husband raised the following points in
                    response:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife was not prejudiced by the
                        divorce proceedings taking place in France as she was ably represented by
                        French counsel and also had the benefit of translation services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     As for Wife’s litigation
                        expenses, the Husband had proposed to pay for the Wife’s airfare and
                        also a daily allowance while she was in France.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the French NRO required the
                        Husband to pay the Wife €10,000 for her litigation costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     According to the Husband’s
                        French counsel, the Wife no longer needed to appear in person before the
                        French court. Even if her attendance was required, she could be heard
                        through a rogatory commission to the French Consulate in
                            Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Thus, there were no special circumstances by
                    reason of which justice required that a stay of the Singapore divorce
                    proceedings be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the light of the above, I allowed the
                    Husband’s appeal and ordered that the divorce proceedings in Singapore be
                    stayed. I made no order as to costs.</p>
