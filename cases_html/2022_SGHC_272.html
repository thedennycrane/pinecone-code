</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The question at hand is when the <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees </span>rule would apply to sponsors of bankrupt litigants – in other words, when would it be just, in all the circumstances to order costs against the third-party sponsors of bankrupt parties? As a starting point, the SGCA has recognised that a sponsor who assists a bankrupt to pursue his appeal <span class="font-italic">could</span> be a potential non-party against whom costs can be ordered in the event that the appeal fails: <span class="font-italic">Goh Heng Seng v Wang </span><span class="font-italic">Xiaopu </span>[2020] SGCA 66 at [16]. However, as accepted by counsel for both Mdm Wang and Dr Goh, there is presently little local authority on the <span class="font-italic">circumstances</span> under which a costs order against a third-party sponsor of an impecunious litigant would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Counsel for Mdm Wang sought to rely on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd and others </span>[2000] 2 Costs LR 169<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Locabai</span><span class="font-italic">l</span>”), where costs were ordered against the claimant who was funded by a third-party sponsor. As counsel for Mdm Wang rightly recognised, the case of <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did not suggest that there was a general rule that third-party sponsors of impecunious litigants should be liable for the costs of the proceedings, but simply that it was just in the circumstances of that case for costs to be ordered against the third-party sponsor. <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>centered around a property known as Hawks Hill. The registered proprietor of Hawks Hill was a Panamanian company (“Aurora”) which was owned by Mr Ares Emmanuel. Mr Emmanuel had procured Aurora to grant a first charge over Hawks Hill to Locabail (UK) Ltd (“Locabail”). Locabail and Mr Emmanuel subsequently agreed to have Hawks Hill transferred to the first defendant, Bayfield Properties Ltd (“Bayfield”), and for the initial charge to be replaced by a charge in favour of Allied Trust Bank Ltd (“Allied Trust”). Allied Trust would in turn advance funds to Bayfield for the purchase of Hawks Hill from Aurora.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Emmanuel’s second wife, Mrs Emmanuel, was in occupation of Hawks Hill. She sought to set aside a possession order obtained by Allied Trust (whose rights had now been assigned to Locabail), on the basis that she had acquired an interest in Hawks Hill under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel owing to oral representations made to her by Mr Emmanuel. Her application to set aside the possession order was dismissed and costs were ordered against her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Peter Tavoulareas, Mrs Emmanuel’s first husband, was ordered to pay the costs ordered against Mrs Emmanuel. Mr Lawrence Collins QC, sitting as a Deputy Judge in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice held (at 185) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… </span>I have come to the conclusion that the relevant factors do make this one of those cases with such exceptional circumstances as would justify an order of costs. I do so on the combination of <span class="font-weight-bold">(a) Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Tavoulareas’ funding of the proceedings and the fact that it follows from his evidence that he knew Mrs Emmanuel would not be able to satisfy a costs order if she lost; (b) his intense identification in his evidence with Mrs Emmanuel’s position; (c) his indifference to the legal and factual issues; and (d) my rejection of the factual basis of Mrs Emmanuel’s case</span>. I am conscious that, but for the fact that he gave evidence, two of these factors would not have been apparent, and that he may not have had the opportunity to obtain professional advice on his potential liability before he gave evidence. <span class="font-weight-bold">Nevertheless, I do not consider that it would be unjust or unfair for Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Tavoulareas to bear the consequences of funding litigation, the object of which he fully supported, in which he participated and with which he ultimately identified himself</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I noted that there have also been instances in English case law where the court has found that non-party funders of plaintiffs<span class="font-italic"> </span>in an action ought not be held liable for costs ordered against said plaintiffs. In <span class="font-italic">Hamilton v Al Fayed (No 2) </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 665 (“<span class="font-italic">Hamilton</span>”), the claimant had brought and lost a libel action, which he was able to bring because of a fighting fund contributed by pure funders, on the understanding that the money would be returned only if the action was successful. In holding that the pure funders were not liable for costs ordered against the claimant, Simon Brown LJ stated (at [47]–[48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in my judgment the pure funding of litigation (whether of claims or defences) ought generally to be regarded as being in the public interest providing only and always that its essential motivation is to enable the party funded to litigate what the funders perceive to be a genuine case. This approach ought not to be confined merely to relatives moved by natural affection but rather should extend to anyone – not least those responding to a fund-raising campaign – whose contribution (whether described as charitable, philanthropic, altruistic or merely sympathetic) is animated by a wish to ensure that a genuine dispute is not lost by default … So long as the law continues to allow impoverished parties to litigate without their having to provide security for their opponent’s costs, those sympathetic to their plight should not be discouraged from assisting them to secure representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Chadwick LJ held that the risk of injustice to a claimant to have effective and represented access to the courts would be the predominant concern against ordering costs against the funders of impecunious claimants (at [64]– [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But the courts have had to balance the risk of injustice to the defendant in those circumstances against the risk of injustice to a claimant who is denied access to the courts to pursue a genuine claim; and the scales have come down in favour of the latter. Access to the courts is one thing; effective access with the benefit of legal representation is another. This is not to suggest that those who choose to represent themselves – or who are forced by circumstances to do so – do not receive a full and fair hearing … But it would be idle to pretend that an unrepresented claimant in complex proceedings will not be at some disadvantage against a skilled and experienced advocate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 From <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hamilton</span>, it appears that while the provision of funding is not in itself an automatic justification for a costs order against third-party litigation sponsors, funding may be indicative of factors including the litigation sponsor’s close connection to the proceedings and/or role in incurring legal costs. In such cases, it may be just in the circumstances to order that costs be borne by the litigation sponsor. That being said, the court must consider the risk of injustice to claimants who, if not for the funding provided, would be deprived of effective access to the courts with the benefit of legal representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Preliminarily, I noted counsel for Dr Goh’s clarification that Dr Michelle Goh’s Undertaking was only to pay for Dr Goh’s legal fees, and not his party-and-party costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 More importantly, the cases identified above contemplated costs orders against the sponsors of impecunious <span class="font-italic">claimants</span>; they did not account for situations where the impecunious party is on the defensive and has not opted to enter litigation in the first place. SUM 5041 entailed committal proceedings brought <span class="font-italic">against</span> Dr Goh and were not commenced by him. The question of whether costs should be ordered against the sponsor of an impecunious third-party defendant is likely to be an uncommon one, as there is little incentive for a claimant to pursue a claim against a bankrupt individual. In this case, the reason why proceedings had been initiated against Dr Goh despite his status as an undischarged bankrupt was simply because these were committal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Further, it is precisely because these proceedings are for a committal application that the risk of injustice stemming from a lack of access to legal representation was even more serious here. Losing these proceedings could result in imprisonment for Dr Goh (as did happen). The difficulty Dr Goh would have faced as an unrepresented layperson in mounting his defence was a material factor as his liberty was at stake. I was of the view that this factor justified not ordering costs against Dr Michelle Goh.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Costs ordered against Dr Goh</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether costs should be ordered on an indemnity basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Counsel for Mdm Wang submitted that indemnity costs should be ordered on the basis of Dr Goh’s dishonest conduct and abuse of process.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”) at [18]. In <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [23(c)]), Chan Seng Onn J held that a party’s dishonest, abusive or improper conduct in the course of proceedings would be one of the categories of conduct which may provide good reason for an order of indemnity costs to be made. That being said, the failure of a losing party to disclose relevant material did not mean that indemnity costs should be awarded to the winning party as a matter of course, as the seriousness of the non-disclosure must be considered (at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The baseline inquiry for the court when deciding if it is appropriate to make an order of indemnity costs is whether the party’s conduct was so unreasonable as to justify this order. It is relevant to consider whether and the extent to which the party’s conduct had caused prejudice to the other party, and the court should bear in mind the context and nature of the dispute when considering if the case is of such an exceptional nature that it is appropriate to depart from the standard basis of costs. It would only be in rare cases that indemnity costs are ordered despite the absence of unreasonable conduct, as there is a penal element and stigma attached to an order of indemnity costs (at [50]–[53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Counsel for Mdm Wang submitted that Dr Goh had behaved dishonestly
