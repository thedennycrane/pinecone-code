                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant in this appeal, Kwek Seow Hock
                    (“the Appellant”), appealed against the judgment of the High Court
                    judge (“the Judge”) in Criminal Case No 8 of 2008. The Judge
                    convicted the Appellant on a charge of trafficking in not less than 25.91g of
                    diamorphine (more commonly known as heroin) without any authorisation – a
                    capital offence that is punishable pursuant to s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Kwek Seow Hock</em> [2009] SGHC 202 (“the
                    GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the submissions of the Appellant
                    and the Prosecution, we dismissed this appeal. We now give our
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant had worked for one “Ah
                    Long”, an unauthorised supplier of controlled drugs, in making drug
                    deliveries to persons as instructed by Ah Long. On 20 July 2007, the
                    Appellant was instructed to receive drugs from one “Ah
                        Seng”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> After
                    meeting Ah Seng, he was on his way to hand over S$6,650.00 in cash to one
                        “Jackie”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    when, at around 11.15pm, he was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotic
                    Bureau (“the CNB”) at the vicinity of the car park of
                    Block 23 Hougang Avenue 3.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> When he was arrested, the Appellant had
                    in his possession a black “Hugo Boss” paper bag.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> An “Ever
                    Rich” paper bag was found inside the “Hugo Boss” paper bag.
                    The paper bags contained, <em>inter alia</em>, S$6,650 in
                    cash, one red packet that contained one sachet and one straw of white granular
                    substance, one red packet that contained 6½ dormicum tablets, and 46
                    packets of white granular substance<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (“the
                    Packets”), which were subsequently established by scientific analysis to
                    contain 25.91g of diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Appellant was also
                    found to have S$2,409.15 in cash in his wallet and pockets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Pursuant to s 17 of the Act, there was a
                    presumption that the Appellant had the Packets (which contained 25.91g of
                    diamorphine) in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. On 25 July
                    2007, a long statement (<em>ie</em>, a statement recorded
                    pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”)) was recorded, in which the
                    Appellant made the following admission:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the drugs found in the black bag are for selling. Only the one packet
                        of heroin, 1 straw of heroin and 6 ½ [d]ormicum tablets [<em>ie</em>, the drugs found in the red packets] are for my
                        consumption, the rest are for selling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant, in addition, did not dispute the fact that he knew that
                    the Packets contained diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       However, during the trial, the Appellant claimed
                    that he had intended to retain 23 of the Packets (<em>ie</em>, half of the Packets) for his own consumption (this will be
                    referred to as “the defence of consumption” where appropriate). If
                    the Judge had accepted the defence of consumption, the Appellant would have,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, successfully established that the
                    quantity of diamorphine that he had trafficked in was not above the 15g
                    threshold for his offence to attract capital punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the conclusion of the trial, the Judge
                    rejected the defence of consumption and held that the Appellant had failed, on a
                    balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumption under s 17 of the Act.
                    Accordingly, the Prosecution was held to have established its case beyond
                    reasonable doubt (see [78] of the GD).
                    The main reasons for rejecting the defence of consumption could be said to be as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant did not have the
                        financial means to purchase half of the Packets, and there was no
                        arrangement to pay Ah Long in instalments (see [35]–[46] and
                            [73] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     As the
                        Appellant admitted that he had a ready supply or access to heroin, it was
                        unlikely that he would have needed to stockpile 23 of the Packets for
                        himself (see [47] and [73] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     An adverse inference could justifiably
                        be drawn against the Appellant, as he had failed to mention the defence of
                        consumption in his long statements (see [65]–[70] and
                            [74] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Appellant
                        had stated in his long statement dated 25 July 2007 that all of the
                        drugs that were seized, save for the drugs in the two red packets, were for
                        sale (see [65] and [74] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the Appellant had really intended to
                        keep 23 of the Packets for himself, it would have been reasonable to expect
                        him to separate out those that he had intended to keep before he met Jackie
                        to pass the rest to him (see [76] of
                        the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In relation to (c) above, the Judge did not draw
                    an adverse inference from the Appellant’s failure to mention the defence
                    of consumption in his cautioned statement (<em>ie</em>, a
                    statement recorded pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC), after having regard to
                    the fact that the statement was recorded early in the morning and the probable
                    poor state of the Appellant at that point in time (see [60]–[64] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The submissions on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The main submissions of the Appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant’s case, in essence, was that
                    the Judge had made the wrong findings of fact on the evidence in coming to the
                    conclusion that the presumption under s 17 of the Act had not been
                    rebutted. It was, in particular, submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant intended to hand over
                        only the money to Jackie, and that was why he did not separate the half of
                        the Packets which he had intended to keep for his own
                    use.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant
                        had the financial means to pay for half of the Packets. He had S$2,409.15 in
                        cash (which was found on him) and S$1,200 in his bank account, and expected
                        to receive S$650 from Jackie. Also, he could pay Ah Long in
                        instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Appellant did not have ready access to heroin as he received an average of
                        one consignment of drugs from Ah Long every two months, and given that the
                        Appellant was a heavy user of heroin, it was reasonable for him to stockpile
                        a sufficient quantity of heroin to satisfy his needs until the next
                        consignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant also contended that the Judge had
                    erred in law in drawing an adverse inference against him for his failure to
                    disclose the defence of consumption in his long statements. Counsel for the
                    Appellant pointed out that when those statements were recorded, the Appellant
                    was under the impression that he would face a charge of trafficking 335g of
                    heroin (which would be substantially above the capital offence threshold of
                    15g), and, therefore, he did not think that it would have mattered whether or
                    not he stated that 23 of the Packets were intended for his own
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The main submissions of the Prosecution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Prosecution’s case, in essence, was
                    that the Judge had made the correct findings and that the defence of consumption
                    was an afterthought. The Prosecution contended that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     The fact that the Appellant was a
                        heavy user of heroin did not necessarily mean that he had intended to keep
                        23 of the Packets for his own consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge’s finding that the Appellant had
                        intended to deliver both the drugs and the money to Jackie was supported by
                        the Appellant’s long statement dated 22 July 2007 where he stated
                        that Ah Long had instructed him to pass the drugs to someone at
                        Block 23 Hougang Avenue 3 (where he was arrested).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellant had no reason to
                        stockpile two to three months’ supply of heroin since he admitted that
                        he had ready access to Ah Long, and, furthermore, it was risky for him to
                        keep so many packets of heroin in his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Appellant did not have the
                        financial resources to purchase 23 of the Packets, as he did not have
                        sufficient cash or a real source of income, and, further, there was no
                        evidence to support his claim that he could pay Ah Long in
                        instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Prosecution also submitted that the Judge
                    was not wrong to have drawn an adverse inference against the Appellant due to
                    his failure to disclose the defence of consumption in his long statements. In
                    this regard, reference was made to the decision of this court in <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny v Public Prosecution</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 689 (“<em>Lim Lye Huat
                    Benny</em>”). In that case, this court upheld the decision of the
                    trial court to draw an adverse inference against the appellant due to his
                    failure to mention his defence or the material aspects of it in his long
                    statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings of fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Based on the evidence before the Judge, it was
                    our view that the Judge had not erred in his findings of fact. The Appellant
                    had, to begin with, admitted in his long statement dated 25 July 2007 that
                    the Packets were meant for “selling” (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above). That aside, the Judge was justified in finding on
                    the evidence that the Appellant had no reason to stockpile 23 of the Packets
                    when he had ready access to a supply from Ah Long, and also that he would not
                    have been able to finance the purchase of 23 of the Packets. In his long
                    statement dated 22 July 2007, the Appellant also stated that he had been
                    instructed to deliver both the drugs and the money to Jackie. He
                        said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Ah Long] told me to pass [the drugs] to someone at [Block] 23
                        Hougang Ave 3. ... He also told me to pass the $6[,]650 to the person.
                        The money will be together with the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the evidence, the only person whom the Appellant intended to meet
                    at Block 23 Hougang Avenue 3 was Jackie. Therefore, the Judge was well
                    entitled to conclude that the “someone at [Block] 23 Hougang
                    Ave 3” was in fact Jackie. Counsel for the Appellant argued that the
                    evidence indicated that the Appellant had only admitted that he would pass money
                    to Jackie, but not drugs. The Judge did not accept this argument as it
                    contradicted the Appellant’s own words. We agreed with the
                Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     These reasons alone would be sufficient to
                    explain our dismissal of the appeal. However, for completeness, we will touch on
                    the question of whether the Judge was correct to draw an adverse inference
                    against the Appellant for failing to state the defence of consumption in his
                    long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adverse inference </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Under s 122(6) of the CPC, a person, when
                    charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for an
                    offence, has to be served with a notice informing him that if he holds back any
                    fact that he intends to rely on in his defence till he goes to court, his
                    evidence may be less likely to be believed. The basis for a court to draw
                    adverse inferences from a failure to mention material facts when subjected to
                    this caution can be found in s 123(1) of the CPC, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence evidence
                        is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially
                        informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such
                        fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could
                        reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed, as the
                        case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for
                        trial or whether there is a case to answer, and the court, in determining
                        whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such
                        inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the
                        basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting
                        to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to
                        which the failure is material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the present case, the Appellant omitted to
                    mention the defence of consumption in his cautioned statement. However, the
                    Judge declined to draw an adverse inference for this omission. In this regard,
                    he stated ([61]–[62] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    I take certain guidance from the Court of
                            Appeal’s analysis in <em>Lim Lye Huat
                                Benny</em>, the facts of which are rather similar to the
                            present facts before me. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    I ... found that there could be a plausible
                            explanation for the [Appellant’s] failure to mention his defence
                            in his s 122(6) statement. It was early in the morning and he
                            probably did not have any rest or food at the time the s 122(6)
                            statement was recorded. He had just been arrested the night before.
                            Also, he was probably feeling unwell due to his craving for heroin and
                            his consequent withdrawal symptoms, some six to seven hours after his
                            last consumption. I therefore opted not to draw an adverse inference
                            against this instance of failure to mention his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The case that the Judge referred to, <em>viz</em>, <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny</em>, was a
                    case where this court accepted the appellant’s contention that no adverse
                    inference should be drawn against him with respect to his cautioned statement as
                    it had been recorded at an unearthly time when he had been too tired and hungry
                    to think of his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge, in contrast, drew an adverse
                    inference against the Appellant for failing to state the defence of consumption
                    in his long statements. The Judge explained as follows ([68]–[70] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    At the time that [the Appellant] gave his
                            s 121 statement, it ought to have been apparent to him that it
                            would be important to state material aspects of his defence, such as
                            that half of [the Packets] found on him [were] for his own consumption,
                            rather than emphasise that the drugs were for selling. I rejected
                            defence counsel’s explanation in submissions that the [Appellant]
                            was still suffering from inner restlessness and that his mental
                            faculties were still affected at the time his statement was recorded.
                            This was not the first time he has been charged with an offence of drug
                            trafficking. He should have known that the fact that he had intended to
                            keep for his own consumption half of the drugs he had been caught in
                            possession of – certainly a significant amount – would have
                            been an important fact in his defence to a drug trafficking charge.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    Furthermore, he had two other opportunities to
                            mention his defence when further statements were recorded under
                            s 121 from him on 13 September 2007 and 3 October 2007.
                            Yet, on those occasions, he never uttered a word on [the] defence of
                            consumption. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70    I therefore drew an adverse inference against the
                            [Appellant] in respect of his failure to mention anything at all about
                            the defence of consumption in any of his s 121
                        statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This approach is consistent with the approach
                    taken in <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny</em>, where this court
                    stated (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the same [<em>ie</em>, that an adverse
                        inference cannot be drawn] cannot be said with reference to [the
                        appellant’s] failure to mention in his s 121 statement that he
                        believed that he was carrying counterfeit money. That was a lengthy
                        statement given by him on 21 February 1995, which was some three days
                        after his arrest and it was recorded at the time between 10.30am and 3.10pm
                        with a break in between. That statement contained a detailed account of his
                        first meeting with Richard, of his subsequent contacts with Richard, of what
                        Richard asked him to do when they met on the 17 February 1995,
                            <em>ie</em> the day of the offence, and of what
                        Richard handed to him at that meeting. However, not a word was mentioned of
                        Richard’s representation to him that what he was asked to deliver was
                        counterfeit money and of how he came to possess the counterfeit note of
                        RM50. His explanation was that his brother had told him that his brother
                        would engage a lawyer to defend him and therefore he did not think that it
                        was important to mention that the plastic bag contained counterfeit money.
                        But that explanation was not accepted by the learned trial judge. In our
                        judgment, the learned trial judge was entitled to take this view of his
                        evidence and to draw an adverse inference against him. The learned judge
                        also held that the appellant had failed to convince him that it was
                        unremarkable to be paid $3,000 for carrying a plastic bag from Rochor Road
                        to Bedok Reservoir Road. In consequence, the learned trial judge did not
                        find his evidence sufficiently convincing and did not accept his evidence
                        that he believed that the content of the plastic bag was counterfeit money.
                        Looking at the evidence on the totality, we cannot say that the learned
                        trial judge was plainly wrong in this finding. In the circumstances, the
                        appellant has not, in our judgment, rebutted the presumptions under
                        ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Act. This appeal accordingly fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is necessary to add that the court is not
                    always entitled to draw an adverse inference for failure to disclose a material
                    fact in long statements. The reason is that s 121 of the CPC allows an
                    accused to withhold mentioning any fact or circumstance that, if disclosed, may
                    incriminate him. Section 121 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Examination of witnesses by
                            police</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>121</b>.—(1) A police officer making
                        a police investigation under this Chapter may examine orally any person
                        supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and
                        shall reduce into writing any statement made by the person so
                        examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    
              <em>Such person shall be bound to
                                state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted
                                concerning the case except only that he may decline to make with
                                regard to any fact or circumstance a statement which would have a
                                tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or
                                forfeiture</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A statement made by any person under this section
                            shall be read over to him and shall, after correction if necessary, be
                            signed by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 121 of the CPC is a
                    straightforward provision. The person under investigation is “bound to
                    state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted concerning
                    the case”, except that he may decline to state any fact or circumstance
                    which would incriminate him in any way. He is entitled to remain silent in so
                    far as self-incrimination is concerned. In our view, because an accused has such
                    a right against self-incrimination when he makes a long statement under
                    s 121, no adverse inference, in general, may be drawn against him for
                    failing to state any fact or circumstance which may incriminate him in any
                    way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     If, however, the fact or circumstance that is
                    withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably
                    infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that
                    there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or
                    circumstance. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he
                    is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected
                    to disclose why he has such a belief. For a self-confessed trafficker like the
                    Appellant, consumption would be an exculpatory fact. Furthermore, an exculpatory
                    fact or circumstance has more credibility if disclosed to an investigating
                    officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest. Thus, in <em>Chou Kooi Pang and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 205, this court (without referring to <em>Lim Lye
                        Huat Benny</em>) held, in regard to one of the appellants, that his
                    “failure to mention a material part of his defence at an earlier stage
                    meant that it was less likely to be believed” (at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the fact of an intention
                    to retain 23 of the Packets for self-consumption (if proved) would effectively
                    have exculpated the Appellant from an offence of trafficking that carries the
                    death penalty. Accordingly, it would have been in his own interest to have
                    mentioned it at the first opportunity to the investigating officer. He did not.
                    Instead, he gave an explanation as to why he did not do so – this being
                    that he thought that it would be of no use. The Judge, in our view, rightly
                    rejected this explanation. That said, it was not necessary for the Judge to draw
                    an adverse inference against the Appellant in order to reject the defence of
                    consumption as being not credible in the circumstances. A court is entitled to
                    disbelieve the evidence of a witness without having to draw an adverse inference
                    against him for omitting to earlier mention some material fact which, if disclosed,
                    would be in his favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For the above reasons, we agreed with the
                    Judge’s decision, and dismissed this appeal.</p>
