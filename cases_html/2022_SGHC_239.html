He and his co-director believed it was in the best interests of the Company to be compulsorily wound up. They had considered initiating a creditors’ voluntary liquidation process for the Company. However, one of the requirements for this process is that the Company must pass a special resolution to this effect. The claimant did not believe that a quorum of shareholders could be achieved for such a special resolution to be passed.

</div> Accordingly, he brought the present application for permission to commence winding up proceedings against the Company pursuant to s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The generally applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I considered first the generally applicable law, leaving the specific principles for discussion later at the appropriate junctures. The starting point is s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for winding up</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">124.</span> —(1)  A company, whether or not it is being wound up voluntarily, may be wound up under an order of the Court on the application of one or more of the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any director of the company; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must in turn be read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA (“s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)”), which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">124.</span> — …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Despite subsection (1), the following apply:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a person mentioned in subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) may not make a winding up application unless a prima facie case for winding up is established to the satisfaction of the Court, and the Court grants that person permission to bring the winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Prior to the IRDA, a director of a company did not have legal standing under Singapore law to apply to wind up the company. The absence of any statutory provision prescribing such a ground of winding up has, in turn, created difficulties in certain situations where it might be necessary for a director to file an application to wind up the company. For example, this could be where the shareholders and other directors of the company have abandoned the company, and the locally resident director becomes subject to liability for insolvent or fraudulent trading or failure to file annual returns (see <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee: Final Report </span>(Chair: Lee Eng Beng SC) (2013) at p 74 (“<span class="font-italic">Final Report</span>”)). Thus, s 459P(2)(c) of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“the Corporations Act 2001”), which similarly provides that an application for a court-ordered winding up by a director requires the leave of court (see [19] below), is likewise justified by the concern about the director’s liability for insolvent trading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Given the practical benefits of allowing a director standing to commence a winding up application, and the lacuna in the law providing for this, it appears that the practice in some jurisdictions was to tolerate what would otherwise be irregular winding up applications. For example, in England, the irregular practice of allowing a company to present a winding up petition on the strength of a resolution from directors was tolerated for many years (see <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmadart Ltd </span>[1979] 1 All ER 599 at 605). This remained the case in England until the problem was resolved by the passage of the Insolvency Act 1986 which expressly confers on directors the standing to petition (see <span class="font-italic">Woon’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Corporations Law</span> <span class="font-italic">2019 Desk Edition</span> (Walter Woon SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2019, April 2021 release)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 354). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Section 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was introduced in the IRDA to give a director of a company the legal standing to apply to wind up the company. However, while this solves the problems associated with a director not having standing to commence winding up applications, it can also lead to abuse by such a director. This may occur where there are disputes among the directors and/or shareholders of a company, and a single director is able to use an application for winding up as “a pressure tactic or to secure a strategic advantage” (see <span class="font-italic">Final Report </span>at p 74). Accordingly, the Insolvency Law Review Committee in its <span class="font-italic">Final Report</span> – which informs the purpose of the IRDA – proposed that appropriate safeguards had to be put in place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 These safeguards eventually manifested in s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which is expressly applicable only to s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). In this regard, the Insolvency Law Review Committee expressed the following views on the necessary safeguards (see <span class="font-italic">Final Report </span>at p 75):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Committee is of the view that a single director ought to be given the right to commence winding up proceedings against the company, but only where the director is able to show that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the company ought to be wound up, and where leave of court is obtained to do so (in a manner similar to the derivative actions commenced in the name of the company pursuant to section 216A of the Companies Act. <span class="font-italic">The application for leave of the court will allow the court to satisfy itself that the winding up application is being made by the director for a legitimate reason, and not an improper purpose</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Accordingly, on a plain reading of s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), as informed by the views expressed in the <span class="font-italic">Final Report</span>, I was of the view that an application, under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for permission to be given to a director to commence a winding up application against a company, should be analysed in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the director must be able to show that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the company ought to be wound up.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the director can show such a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, the court may grant permission for the director to commence a winding up application, if it is satisfied that, among other considerations, the winding up application is being made for a legitimate reason and not for an improper purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I derived support for this manner of analysing an application under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) from the Federal Court of Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">International </span><span class="font-italic">Entertainment Corp Pty Ltd v Soccer Australia Ltd </span>[2002] FCA 879 (“<span class="font-italic">International Entertainment</span>”). In that case, Emmett J had to consider an application under s 459P(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. Section 459P(2) refers to an application by persons, including a director, for leave to apply to court for a company to be wound up. Pursuant to s 459P(3), the court may only give leave if it is satisfied that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the company is insolvent. As such, the application contemplated by s 459P(2) is similar to that under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Emmett J held that an application for leave under s 459P(2) raises three issues (at [5]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[5]  … The first is whether an applicant can be said to be a creditor, albeit a contingent or prospective creditor. The second is whether the applicant can satisfy the Court that there is a prima facie case that the Company is insolvent. The third issue is whether the Court should exercise the discretion to give leave, even if satisfied that there is a prima facie case that the Company is insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Apart from the first issue, which is required as s 459P(2) refers to persons other than just a director, the other two issues mirror those I have identified above. Further, I should add that, in considering whether to grant permission, the court should consider the facts set out in the affidavits tendered in support of the application for permission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 With these applicable principles in mind, I proceeded to consider the present application. The first question was whether the claimant had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the Company ought to be wound up. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimant has shown a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> case that the Company ought to be wound up</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law: a </span><span class="font-weight-bold">prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In determining this first question, I considered what a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” in the context of s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA means. In this regard, the Insolvency Law Review Committee in the <span class="font-italic">Final Report</span> had stated that permission should be granted “only where the director is able to show that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the company ought to be wound up, and where leave of court is obtained to do so (in a manner similar to the derivative actions commenced in the name of the company pursuant to s 216A of the Companies Act” (see <span class="font-italic">Final Report </span>at p 75). Given the Committee’s reference to s 216A of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“s 216A”), which prescribes the statutory requirements for commencing a statutory derivative action, it might appear logical to refer to case law on s 216A of the Companies Act to infer what a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” means in the context of s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. In my view, this would be incorrect for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, a contextual reading of the Committee’s statement quoted above suggests that it had intended only to analogise the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of the application for leave to commence a winding up application (and not the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard) with the application under s 216A for leave to commence a statutory derivative action. As such, I did not think that the Committee intended the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard, as it has been developed in relation to s 216A, to be applicable to establishing a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Second, how the “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>” standard is referred to under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA and s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act are quite different. Whereas s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) refers to the director needing to establish a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case”, s 216A provides, amongst others, that the applicant needs to show that “it appears to be prima facie in the interests of the company” that the statutory derivative action is brought (see s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)). The courts have recognised that there is a difference between a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, and what <span class="font-italic">appears</span> to be a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case (see Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) at p 462). The latter standard, that of an <span class="font-italic">apparent </span><span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, is a lower standard than a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. This relatively lower standard is presumably to recognise that a minority shareholder, in the context of s 216A, is usually not able to obtain sufficient evidence at the leave stage to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn </span><span class="font-italic">Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2011] 3 SLR 980 at [28]). This concern is not as apparent in relation to a director seeking permission to commence a winding up application under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. This is because the director here would presumably have more access to the relevant evidence to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for winding up as compared to a minority shareholder in the context of s 216A. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mukherjee </span><span class="font-italic">Amitava v DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1054 has held (at [25]) that a director has an almost-presumptive right to inspect the documents of a company to the extent that these fall within s 199 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As such, I did not think that the cases discussing the apparent <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard under s 216A of the Companies Act are of assistance in interpreting the <span class="font-italic">prima fac</span><span class="font-italic">ie</span> case standard under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. Instead, I turned to cases that have defined “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” in deriving its meaning in s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Phos</span><span class="font-italic">agro Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1052 (“<span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia</span>”), the Court of Appeal had to consider the meaning of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” in the context of s 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). The court explained the meaning as follows (at [72]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 … The concept of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case” was explained by Wee Chong Jin CJ in the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in <span class="font-italic">Gan Soo Swee v </span><span class="font-italic">Ramoo </span>[1968–1970] SLR(R) 324 (at [21]), where he clarified that in order to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case, a plaintiff had to “prove facts from which in the absence of an explanation liability could properly be inferred”. This definition was cited with approval by Chan Sek Keong CJ in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario </span>[2012] 3 SLR 440 at [7].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen, deriving support from previous cases, the court defined a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” to mean that a claimant has to “prove facts from which in the absence of an explanation liability could properly be inferred”. In other words, when applied to the slightly different context of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for winding up, the claimant must adduce evidence on affidavit which, on its own and without rebuttal, would be sufficient to prove a case for winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I derived support for this interpretation of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case in the context of s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA from the Supreme Court of Victoria decision of <span class="font-italic">Sharda v Bansal </span>[2018] VSC 701 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharda v Bansal</span>”). In that case, Hetyey JR had to consider s 459P(1)(d) read with ss 459P(2)(c) and 459P(3) of the Corporations Act 2001, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">459P Who may apply for order under section 459A</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Any one or more of the following may apply to the Court for a company to be wound up in insolvency:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) a director;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) An application for any of the following, or by persons including any of the following, may only be made with the leave of the Court:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) a director; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The Court may give leave if satisfied that there is a prima facie case that the company is insolvent, but not otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 It can be seen that s 459P(1)(d) read with ss 459P(2)(c) and 459P(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 is substantively similar in content to s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. In essence, both sets of provisions provide that the court may give permission for a director to commence a winding up application against the company if the court is satisfied that the director has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for winding up. In <span class="font-italic">Sharda v Bansal</span>, Hetyey JR provided clear guidance on what a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” meant in this context (at [41] and [42]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[41]  Section 459P(3) makes clear that the Court may give leave if satisfied there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the Company is insolvent.

The question, though, is whether there is a prima facie case, <span class="font-italic">in the sense that, if the evidence remains as it is, there is a probability that, at the trial, the applicant would establish that the Company is insolvent</span>. It is not appropriate for the Court to undertake a preliminary trial of that issue in an application such as this. It is sufficient if the applicant has a fair chance of success. What will be required, of course, will vary from case to case.

I found that these Australian cases supported my view expressed above that the “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case” for winding up referred to by s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA means that the claimant must adduce evidence on affidavit which, on its own and without rebuttal, would be sufficient to prove a case for winding up.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This evidence deposed by the claimant in his affidavit would, on its own and without rebuttal, be sufficient to prove a case for winding up under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) read with s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. Section 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) provides that the court may order a company to be wound up if the company is unable to pay its debts, whereas s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) deems a company to be unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is unable to pay its debts, considering the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company. The Court of Appeal has held in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd v RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tong </span><span class="font-italic">Teik Pte Ltd) </span>[2021] 2 SLR 478 (at [65]) that the cash flow test is the “sole applicable test” to be used to determine insolvency under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which is the predecessor provision to s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). Applying this test, I was satisfied that the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets (both measured within a 12-month timeframe) such that it was not able to meet all debts as and when they fall due. Accordingly, in the absence of any rebuttal, I found that the claimant has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for winding up as required by s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the court should grant permission for the claimant to commence a winding up application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant considerations in deciding to grant permission </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I turned next to the second question under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which was whether the court should grant permission for the director to commence a winding up application. While the section is silent on the relevant considerations in deciding to grant such permission, I was of the view that those considerations include whether the winding up application is being made for a legitimate reason and not for an improper purpose. This follows from the Insolvency Law Review Committee’s views in the <span class="font-italic">Final Report</span> in relation to the purpose of requiring the director to seek the court’s permission. Indeed, given the Committee’s concern to avoid a single director’s use of a winding up application to pressure other directors and/or shareholders in a dispute (see <span class="font-italic">Final Report</span> at pp 74–75), the consideration that the director is not in fact doing so must be the primary consideration for a court in deciding whether to grant permission under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There can, of course, be other relevant considerations. In <span class="font-italic">Sharda v Bansal</span>, Hetyey JR had to interpret s 459P(1)(d) read with ss 459P(2)(c) and 459P(3) of the Corporations Act 2001, which are also silent on the relevant considerations. He pointed to the following considerations he took into account to grant leave (at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[43]  In addition, the following discretionary factors militate in favour of leave being granted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the evidence reveals a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between Mr Sharda and his fellow director, Mr Bansal. That being the case, it appears unlikely that the directors will agree on the appointment of a voluntary administrator if the Company is insolvent. Moreover, Mr Bansal is not in a position to appoint a voluntary administrator himself;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Bansal’s winding up application does not appear to be “mischievous or harmful” and it was not suggested that it was intended to be so;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) there is a clear policy found in Part 5.4 of the <span class="font-italic">Corporations Act</span> that an insolvent company should be promptly wound-up as a matter of public interest. The fact the Company is no longer trading is not an adequate answer to this concern. The Company has no present means to satisfy its liabilities, including future liabilities which continue to arise under the Loan Agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Sharda’s allegations regarding diversion of cash receipts and the under-recording of sales are matters which Mr Sharda in his capacity as director and creditor may properly raise with a liquidator for further investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">International Entertainment</span>, Emmett J also identified (at [42]) the consequences of winding up as a relevant to the court exercising its discretion to grant leave under s 459P(3) of the Corporations Act 2001. In that case, the company had argued that if it were wound up, there would be widespread consequences involving the state of soccer in Australia, such as the cancellation of matches in the National Soccer League and the removal of FIFA’s endorsement, which would prohibit Australia’s national teams from competing internationally (at [41]). The learned judge also identified the existence of a genuine dispute between the parties as to the grounds for winding up as another relevant consideration (at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  As such, Hetyey JR’s and Emmett J’s judgments reveal a few relevant considerations that may also be applicable in our legislative regime:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first consideration concerns the circumstances in which the application for permission is brought. For instance, if the director cannot bring about the winding up of the company in another way, then the director would well be justified to apply for permission to commence a winding up application. This will also go towards showing that the director’s application for permission is not for an improper purpose. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second consideration concerns the presence of any collateral purpose for bringing the winding up application. This would address squarely the primary factor for a court in deciding whether to grant permission under s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third consideration concerns the presence of any allegation of wrongdoing to the company which a director in his or her capacity would be well-placed to raise with the liquidator for further investigation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The fourth consideration is the consequences of winding up if an order were eventually made.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The fifth consideration is the existence of a genuine dispute between the parties as to the grounds for winding up.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Finally, the sixth consideration concerns the general policy that an insolvent company should be promptly wound up as a matter of public interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision: the relevant considerations in the present case favour the grant of permission </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my judgment, having regard to the relevant considerations as set out above, I granted permission for the claimant to commence the winding up application against the Company. Two reasons underlie my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, I found that the claimant was almost compelled to apply for permission under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA to commence a winding up application against the Company. I accepted the claimant’s explanation that it would be impossible or difficult to achieve a quorum of shareholders necessary to pass a special resolution for a voluntary winding up. In particular, the claimant and his co-director have been unable to confirm that ML, as one of the two shareholders of the Company, was prepared to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company’s shareholders to pass a special resolution in favour of initiating the voluntary winding up procedure. I was satisfied that the claimant had made repeated attempts since October 2021 to obtain a definite response from ML on this matter. However, ML has never said definitively whether they were amenable to supporting the passage of such a special resolution. In fact, ML has not responded even after being served with the relevant papers on 1 August 2022, 7 September 2022, and 12 September for the present application.

</div>
</div> In the circumstances, it was unlikely that a special resolution for the voluntary winding up of the Company can be obtained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, and following from the above reason, I found that the claimant’s present application was brought for a legitimate reason and not for an improper purpose. That legitimate reason was that the claimant was compelled to take out the winding application in his capacity as director due to the difficulties he faced with obtaining a definite response from ML on the passage of a special resolution. I was also satisfied that there was no improper purpose in connection with the application.
