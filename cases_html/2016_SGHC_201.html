The Applicant argued that the 2001 conviction, relied upon by the Prosecution for the present consumption charges, was for an offence unknown in law, since morphine had already been classified as a “specified drug” under the 1998 MDA as at 20 July 1998. It was thus no longer a “controlled drug” for the purposes of a consumption offence.

</div>  However, the Applicant does not dispute the fact that he did consume morphine in relation to the 2001 conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 This criminal revision thus sought to quash or set aside the 2001 conviction and the sentence imposed.

Thus, the charge in DAC 25009/2001 was essentially a “charge unknown to law”

The most that could be said was that the charge was imprecise in not stating that morphine was a specified drug.

The Prosecution brought an application for criminal revision seeking to amend the wording of the charge for the accused’s 2002 conviction from one of consumption of a controlled drug under s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the 2001 MDA”) to consumption of a <span class="font-italic">specified</span> drug under s 8(b)(ii) of the 2001 MDA. The application was premised on the argument that the said charge was erroneous and the accused would not be prejudiced by the amendment. The application was dismissed as the court held that the 2002 conviction was for an offence unknown in law and the test for prejudice set out in <span class="font-italic">Garmaz </span>was not satisfied on the facts. The court also observed that there was an inordinate delay of ten years in bringing the application after the accused pleaded guilty.

The matter was heard before the same judge and was dismissed. There were no written grounds given. The same accused then filed Criminal Motion 74 of 2014 (<span class="font-italic">unreported</span>) for leave to refer a question of law of public interest arising out of the decision in Magistrate’s Appeal No 98 of 2013 to the Court of Appeal. The question was whether it was right that he be punished under s 33(4) of the MDA given the High Court’s ruling in <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span> that his prior 2002 conviction was for an offence unknown in law.

The accused brought the application for criminal revision seeking to quash the conviction under s 33A(1) of the MDA as it was premised on another conviction in 2000 for consumption of a controlled drug under s 8(b) of the 1998 MDA. The accused there alleged that the conviction was erroneous since the drug in the charge, morphine, had already been listed as a specified drug by the material time of the offence. The Court dismissed the application on the basis that the criminal revision, if allowed, “would result in the applicant evading justice” and noted (at [7]) that if the accused were really convinced that the 2008 conviction was wrong, he ought to have appealed against the decision in 2008. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Ong Gim Hoo</span>, the accused faced four charges for offences under the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Customs Act”).

If successful, the application would have the effect of rendering the accused liable for the enhanced punishment prescribed in s 128L(5) of the Customs Act, if he were to be found guilty of the four pending charges. The<span class="font-italic"> </span>court also tried to reconcile the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bhavashbhai</span> in the following passage (at [11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Had the accused in <span class="font-italic">Bhavashbhai</span> sought to peruse his criminal records in the midst of, or even prior to, his LT-2 proceedings, he would have understood that he had a recorded LT-1 conviction, and was hence liable to punishment on an LT-2 scale should he reoffend. Had he been troubled with the basis of the LT-1 conviction, namely the word “controlled” rather than “specified” in his previous conviction, he would have brought it up when convicted of the LT-1 offence. He did not. It hence cannot be said that he was caught by surprise when he then faced an LT-2 charge, and it cannot be said that prejudice would have been caused to him by refusing to amend, or set aside, the previous LT-1 conviction as he knew all along – and seemingly accepted – that he was liable to punishment on an LT-2 scale should he reoffend. In <span class="font-italic">Shaik</span>, if the accused were to peruse his criminal records before his LT-1 proceedings, he would not have thought that he was liable to be punished on an LT-1 scale. The LT-1 proceedings would have hence come as a surprise since his records would have revealed that he did not have the requisite convictions to make out an LT-1 charge. To amend his convictions retrospectively would have caused him prejudice. […]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While the Court acknowledged that the mistake in the charges appeared to be of a “technical nature”, it dismissed the application on the basis that the criminal revision could have led to complications. The decision appeared to turn on the Court’s view (at [13]) that if it set aside the convictions and charged the accused on reframed charges and the accused then decided to defend himself against them, “a disproportionate amount of resources may have to be expended to resolve the matter.”  However, the Court also noted (at [13]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is within the trial judge’s powers in the ongoing proceedings, which the respondent faces, to determine whether the previous convictions should count for the purpose of enhanced sentencing in the present proceedings […]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I respectfully disagree with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Shaik </span><span class="font-italic">Alaudeen</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span>, the accused’s 2002 conviction could not be said to be for an offence that was unknown in law. The consumption of morphine has been an offence since the first version of the MDA was enacted in 1973. The reclassification of morphine as a specified drug occurred on 20 July 1998 and was a result of a wider set of changes implemented to impose harsher punishments on repeat consumers of opiate drugs. Morphine was mentioned explicitly as one of these opiate drugs that were targeted (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (1 June 2014) vol 69, at cols 43-44 (Wong Kan Seng, Minister for Home Affairs)). The legislative intent behind the specified/controlled drug classification put it beyond doubt that the mischief targeted is the consumption of morphine.  Consumption of morphine at the material time of the accused’s offence was and remained an offence, so it is wrong to call it an offence unknown in law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is hard to see why the test for prejudice set out in <span class="font-italic">Garmaz </span>was not satisfied on the facts of that case. As pointed out by the court in <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span>, the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens reas</span> under ss 8(b)(i) and 8(b)(ii) of the MDA for consumption of a controlled drug and a specified drug are identical. The accused there did not appear to dispute the fact that he had consumed morphine in 2002 and there was nothing to suggest that he would not have pleaded guilty to the same charge, had it described morphine as a specified drug instead of as a controlled drug. Section 162 of the 1985 CPC, which the Prosecution relied on for the present case, would apply to <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span> equally. There was no suggestion in that case that the accused was misled by the description of morphine as a controlled drug. For that reason, the description of morphine as a controlled drug was really an immaterial error in the particulars of the charge. I disagree with the Court’s comments at [5] of <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span> that to amend the charge and reflect a conviction under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA would prejudice the accused by rendering him liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) of the MDA. Regardless of the wording of the charges, the accused had consumed morphine at least twice, which was the very action that Parliament sought to deter with the enhanced punishment regime. The accused there would have been liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A(1) of the MDA by virtue of the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> requirements being fulfilled but for the error in the description. Therefore, an amendment to the 2002 charge would serve to reflect his true legal liability.  In my view, any amendment made to the 2002 charge would have been a purely technical one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For the same reasons as given above for disagreeing with <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span>, I also respectfully disagree with the approach in <span class="font-italic">Ong Gim Hoo</span> and the attempt therein to reconcile <span class="font-italic">Shaik Alaudeen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bhavashbhai</span>. When balanced against allowing the accused to evade enhanced punishment as a result of a mistake of a “technical nature”, as acknowledged by the Court in that case, the justice of the case clearly lies in favour of allowing the amendment. In any case, on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ong Gim Hoo</span>, it was also not apparent that the accused disputed the fact that he did commit the previous offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The result in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Bhavashbhai</span> would lend authority in favour of dismissing the Applicant’s petition for criminal revision. The observations by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Bhavashb</span><span class="font-italic">hai</span> about the revision potentially resulting in the accused evading justice would apply equally in the present case, since the Applicant brought this application in an attempt to evade enhanced punishment. <span class="font-italic">Bhavashbhai</span> could have been decided on the basis that the description of morphine as a controlled drug was an immaterial error and it did not change the substance of the offence for which the accused was convicted on. It was certainly not an unknown offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Turning to the present case, it is important to note that the Applicant did not dispute at any point that he had indeed consumed morphine in 2001. Consumption of morphine at the material time in DAC 25009/2001 was an offence. Therefore, the Applicant was wrong to call it “an offence unknown to law”. I preferred the Prosecution’s argument that DAC 25009/2001 was only described wrongly. This is similar to a situation where an offence that exists in law is described correctly in a charge in terms of the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> requirements but the wrong section in the statute was stated. This does not make it a non-offence. The present case was not one where the scientific name of the drug was wrongly stated, which would have altered the type of drug that the accused had admitted he consumed. The error was only in the legal classification of morphine. Accordingly DAC 25009/2001 was not fundamentally defective. In any case, the section of the offence in DAC 25009/2001 was stated as s 8(b) of the 2001 MDA, which could not be said to be wrong, although it was imprecise given that s 8(b) has two subsections. Section 8(b) criminalizes offences of consumption of drugs in general and the Applicant pleaded guilty to that. He was therefore aware of what he was pleading guilty to, even if the legal classification of the particular drug was wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I was not satisfied that there was any merit in the Applicant’s case to set aside his 2001 conviction. I therefore dismissed the application for criminal revision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that I should amend DAC 25009/2001 and the corresponding conviction to reflect the Applicant’s consumption of a specified drug in 2001.  There would be no prejudice to the Applicant if I exercise my criminal revisionary powers to the opposite effect of what he sought, <span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>, to amend DAC 25009/2001 to reflect that morphine is a specified drug. Further, the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) for DAC 25009/2001 stated that morphine was both a controlled drug and a specified drug under the 2001 MDA. The Applicant was under no illusion as to what he was pleading guilty to. He consumed morphine, knowing that it was an offence. He accepted the punishment imposed on him. It has been 15 years since the Applicant was convicted on the 2001 charge. There could be no prejudice to the Applicant even if he were to face s 33A(1) charges instead as a result of my amendment of DAC 25009/2001. The fact remained that he consumed morphine in 2001, accepted his conviction and sentence, and was admitted to drug rehabilitation once. Therefore, as a matter of law, he should be liable for enhanced punishment if he is found guilty of the pending charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I acknowledge that there was an error in the charge here but it was a misdescription of the legal classification rather than a fundamental defect. I therefore exercised my criminal revisionary powers to rectify the Applicant’s conviction record. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I dismissed the Applicant’s application to quash the 2001 conviction. Instead, I exercised my revisionary powers to order that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) DAC 25009/2001 be amended by:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) deleting “controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule” and substituting “specified drug as listed in the Fourth Schedule”.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) deleting “Section 8(b)” and substituting “Section 8(b)(ii)”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The SOF for DAC 25009/2001 be amended by:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) deleting from para 9 the words “a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) as well as”.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) deleting from para 10 the words “controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule” and substituting them with “specified drug as listed in the Fourth Schedule”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Applicant’s conviction under DAC 25009/2001 is therefore to stand as a conviction under s 8(b)(ii) of the 1998 MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br>Judge of Appeal</br></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Lau Wing Yum, Marcus Foo and Chan Yi Cheng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br>Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju (S K Kumar Law Practice LLP) for the accused.</br></div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
