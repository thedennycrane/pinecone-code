This prevented the Plaintiff from pursuing his claim against his previous solicitor, Ezekiel Peter Latimer (the “Defendant”) for negligence in Suit 654. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Defendant was the solicitor who represented the Plaintiff when he took out a suit to claim for damages arising from a road traffic accident. The Defendant commenced an action in the District Court between 2010 and 2015 (the “District Court suit”). The Defendant was negligent in handling the Plaintiff’s District Court suit and this resulted in the striking out of the District Court suit. Accordingly, the Plaintiff engaged another law firm, S K Kumar Law Practice LLP (“SKK”), to commence Suit 654 against the Defendant for his negligent handling of the District Court suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 What is particularly ironic in this case is that the order imposed by the First AR which struck out the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in Suit 654 arose because of the irresponsible and lackadaisical conduct of SKK, the Plaintiff’s new solicitors, in the handling of Suit 654. As a result of the order, the Plaintiff is unable to pursue a claim against the Defendant simply because of the errant conduct of SKK. Effectively, the Plaintiff’s District Court suit and Suit 654 were struck out as a result of the errant conduct of the Plaintiff’s two sets of solicitors. Thus, the Plaintiff was gravely disadvantaged <span class="font-italic">twice </span>in his attempts to seek recourse and justice for his road traffic accident case. I find the First AR’s striking-out order draconian and disproportionate in the circumstances because the Plaintiff was not at fault, but yet had to bear the consequences of the misconduct of SKK’s solicitors in Suit 654. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In 2008, the Plaintiff was the hirer of a motor taxi bearing vehicle plate number SHC6348Y belonging to Premier Taxis Pte Ltd (the “motor taxi”).

The “unless order” set out that the plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the order would lead to the action being dismissed with costs, while the defendants’ failure to comply with the order would lead to the defence being struck out and judgment being entered for the plaintiffs. The defendants filed their documents on time, but the plaintiffs failed to do so. The defendants’ solicitors then made an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> application by summons in chambers to perfect the “unless order” and dismiss the plaintiffs’ action. The assistant registrar hearing the application dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim with costs ordered against the plaintiffs. No appeal was filed by the plaintiffs’ solicitors. Thereafter, the plaintiffs engaged new solicitors who made an application before a different assistant registrar asking for the previous assistant registrar’s order to be set aside. The assistant registrar hearing the second application dismissed the plaintiffs’ application without hearing the merits on the basis that he lacked jurisdiction to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On appeal, the High Court agreed that the assistant registrar’s decision to dismiss the plaintiffs’ application without hearing the merits was correct (<span class="font-italic">Changhe</span> at [5]). The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Changhe</span> noted that the matter had already been litigated once by the plaintiffs before the assistant registrar where the plaintiffs’ solicitor was in attendance and had made his submission to the assistant registrar. The High Court held that the plaintiffs, therefore, could not “re-litigate the same matter save by way of an appeal” (<span class="font-italic">Changhe</span> at [6]). In the present case, no solicitor from SKK was present at the PTC on 27 September 2022, although Mr Foo was there to represent SKK. Neither SKK nor Mr Foo was given an opportunity to be heard or to address the court on whether the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC was an appropriate consequence for SKK’s solicitors’ failure to comply with the earlier direction at the PTC on 23 August 2022. SKK did seek a re-hearing or review of the 27 September 2022 Order by way of a letter dated 27 September 2022, but this was refused. It was, therefore, not a case where the Plaintiff was asking, in effect, the Second AR to give a different ruling on a point that had already been taken before and decided by the First AR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Plaintiff, on the other hand, relies on the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">The “MMM</span><span class="font-italic"> Diana” </span>to  argue that the Second AR was in a position to decide on the merits of the Plaintiff’s prayers.

The defendants filed a notice of appeal to a judge in chambers in the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The High Court made no order on the appeal, finding that the appeal was in substance an application for an extension of time to comply with the “unless order” and to set aside the default judgment (<span class="font-italic">The “MMM Diana</span><span class="font-italic">”</span> at [12]). The High Court found that an assistant registrar had jurisdiction to hear the application for an extension of time and that an appeal was possible only after an assistant registrar had decided on the merits of the application. Further, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “MMM Diana” </span>stated that the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Changhe</span> would apply in the context of applications where an assistant registrar was being asked to give a different ruling on a point <span class="font-italic">which had already been argued before</span> and decided by another assistant registrar (<span class="font-italic">The “MMM Diana</span><span class="font-italic">”</span> at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In the present case, although SKK’s solicitor was absent at the PTC on 27 September 2022, SKK had asked Mr Foo to attend to the matter on its behalf. Mr Foo did appear before the First AR, but the latter refused to acknowledge that Mr Foo was representing the Plaintiff and ordered the “unless order” to be operative and struck out the Plaintiff’s SOC. The First AR did not allow Mr Foo to make a submission. It is understandable that the First AR was very frustrated and at his wit’s end as SKK’s solicitors kept on disobeying the court’s directions. The absence of SKK’s solicitors was due to their own unacceptable conduct and defiance of numerous court warnings issued in the course of the PTCs. There were no arguments made at that time on the merits of whether the consequences of the absence of SKK’s solicitor on 27 September 2022 should justify a striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC. Therefore, the Second AR had the jurisdiction to hear the parties on whether a further extension of time should be granted to the Plaintiff, and whether the 27 September 2022 Order should be set aside and the Plaintiff’s SOC reinstated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the order to strike out the Plaintiff’s SOC was proportionate on the facts of the case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I next consider whether the 27 September 2022 Order was proportionate, given that the repeated procedural breaches were attributable to the failure on the part of SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs, and not because of the Plaintiff’s own conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The conduct of SKK’s solicitors was plainly contumelious and unsatisfactory. Their repeated absences from the scheduled PTCs while having conduct of Suit 654 were clearly unacceptable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, the fact that there was an “unless order” in place and that the solicitors’ conduct was contumelious did not automatically mean that the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC would follow. As was stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>, even where it was established that an intentional and contumelious breach of an “unless order” had been committed, the court had to determine what sanction ought to follow; this would be guided by considerations of proportionality (<span class="font-italic">Mitora</span> at [37], [39] and [40]). In <span class="font-italic">Mitora</span>, the Court of Appeal cited with approval (at [39]) the guidance issued by Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Teeni Enterprise Pte Ltd v Singco Pte Ltd</span> [2008] SGHC 115 (at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clearly, the court must balance the need to ensure compliance with court orders which are made to be adhered to and not ignored, and the need to ensure that a party would not be summarily deprived of its cause of action or have default judgment entered against it without any hearing of the merits especially when the non-compliance or breach, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, was not so serious or aggravating as to warrant such a severe consequence: see <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR 117 at [4]. The discretionary power to enforce the unless order according to its strict terms must therefore be exercised judiciously and cautiously after carefully weighing everything in the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On the facts, the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC because of the failure of SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs was a disproportionate consequence. There was no suggestion by the parties before the Second AR or on appeal that the conduct of SKK’s solicitors was instigated by the Plaintiff himself or attributable to the Plaintiff’s conduct. The evidence suggests that the Plaintiff was not even aware of the obstinate misconduct of his solicitors in refusing to attend the PTCs. It was the disrespectful misconduct of SKK’s solicitors that resulted in the Plaintiff’s SOC being struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 When the case came before the First AR on 27 September 2022, Mr Foo should have been given an opportunity to explain the reasons for the absence of SKK’s solicitors and why the “unless order” should not be allowed to be operative. These were not done and the “unless order” was allowed to be operative. The First AR was understandably displeased, but he should not have allowed the “unless order” to be operative as it would adversely affect the Plaintiff’s claim. Having the Plaintiff’s SOC struck out, the Plaintiff would thus be unable to obtain justice for his road traffic accident case for the second time. I should emphasise that none of this is attributed to the fault of the Plaintiff, but rather a result of his errant solicitors’ contumelious conduct. On this basis, it would have been wholly disproportionate to pin the consequences of the solicitors’ misconduct on the Plaintiff. This was especially so when the effect of doing so meant that the Plaintiff would no longer be able to hold the Defendant accountable for the Defendant’s conduct in DC 1462.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 More significantly, it was clear that the Defendant had not suffered any irremediable prejudice due to the delay arising from the failure by SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs. Further, the Plaintiff had already been ordered to pay costs to the Defendant on three previous occasions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, at the PTC on 14 June 2022, the Plaintiff had been ordered to pay costs of $3,000 to the Defendant in view of the wasted costs arising from the four adjournments granted at the PTCs between 12 April 2022 and 23 May 2022.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, following the 27 September 2022 Order, the First AR had ordered costs of the action payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant to be agreed upon or taxed. When I allow the appeal, the errant solicitors for the Plaintiff will nevertheless have to bear the costs. The quantum of the costs will be determined after submissions are made by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Plaintiff had also been ordered to pay costs of $2,000 to the Defendant after the hearing of SUM 3828 on 4 November 2022.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s argument that SKK’s solicitors should have been aware of the consequences of failing to attend court hearings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the Defendant’s written submission, he argues that SKK’s solicitors should have been cognisant of the consequences of failing to attend hearings fixed by the court. In particular, the Defendant highlighted the recent High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy Rajoo and another v Sheila Devi d/o Pakirisamy Rajoo</span> [2022] SGHC 285 (“<span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span>”), where See Kee Oon J had warned one of SKK’s solicitors, Mr Singh, about his unacceptable conduct in failing to attend trial without giving prior notice to the court.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s HC/RA 334/2022 Submissions at paras 21– 27.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span>, the case was scheduled for a two-day trial. However, both the plaintiffs and their counsel, Mr Singh, were absent on the first day of trial without any prior notice given to the court. Following the brief submissions from the defendant’s counsel, See J dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim. Medical certificates covering one plaintiff and Mr Singh were subsequently produced during a summons hearing which sought to set aside See J’s dismissal of the claim. However, these medical certificates did not excuse the plaintiff or Mr Singh from court proceedings. In arriving at his decision, See J considered the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiffs and Mr Singh did not have good reasons for being absent from trial. The medical certificates did not operate to excuse the plaintiffs or Mr Singh from court attendance. Further, no notice was given to the court ahead of the trial (<span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> at [34], [35] and [39]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs’ claim did not appear to have a real prospect of success. No objective evidence was put forth by the plaintiffs to support their allegations. Further, one of their claims was time-barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) (<span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> at [44]–[48]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Although the plaintiffs had applied promptly to set aside the judgment dismissing their claim, this appeared to undermine their claims that they were so ill that they could not be present for trial (<span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> at [50]–[51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Defendant, in this case, argues that Mr Singh and SKK’s solicitors should have been especially mindful of the need to attend court hearings following See J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span>. The facts in <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> and this case are significantly different. In particular, there are two key differences between <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> and the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Pa</span><span class="font-italic">kirisamy</span>, both the plaintiffs and the solicitor failed to attend the trial on the scheduled date. The plaintiffs were also unable to satisfactorily account for their absence from trial. One plaintiff produced a medical certificate that See J observed was obtained under questionable circumstances and which did not excuse the plaintiff from court proceedings. The second plaintiff failed to produce any medical certificate to explain her absence from trial. This was quite unlike the present case where the contumelious conduct was only on the part of the solicitors from SKK. No evidence was adduced before me to show that the Plaintiff was complicit in the contumelious conduct of the solicitors from SKK. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Further, and more significantly, See J opined<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the plaintiffs’ claim in <span class="font-italic">Pakirisamy</span> lacked a real prospect of success. On the contrary, the Plaintiff appears to have a strong case to claim for damages arising from the road traffic accident involving his motor taxi’s collision with a motor lorry. The Plaintiff also appears to have a strong case against the Defendant for the latter’s negligent handling of his road traffic accident claim. This is especially so since the Defendant does not dispute in the pleadings that it was his own failure to set down DC 1462 for trial which caused the Plaintiff’s road traffic accident claim to be struck off in the District Court.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Defence at para 14.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, to strike out the Plaintiff’s SOC which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> appears to have a real substantial prospect of success would be a wholly disproportionate response to address the misconduct of the Plaintiff’s solicitors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 While SKK’s solicitors should have been aware of the consequences of failing to attend court hearings, the Defendant has not satisfactorily explained why the Plaintiff, who was innocent of the failure of SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs, should bear the brunt of his solicitors’ misconduct and to have his SOC struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s suggestion that the Plaintiff would continue to have recourse was unsatisfactory</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the course of the oral submissions on 13 January 2023, the Defendant suggested that the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC was not fatal to the Plaintiff’s claim as he could then proceed with another action against SKK for its solicitors’ negligent conduct of his case in Suit 654. The Defendant readily acknowledged, however, that the Plaintiff would have to jump through additional hurdles before the Plaintiff would be able to successfully obtain justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This is a wholly unsatisfactory, unjust and prejudicial recourse available to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was already denied access to justice in DC 1462 because of the errant conduct of his previous solicitor, the Defendant. By striking out the Plaintiff’s SOC in Suit 654, the Plaintiff would have once again been denied access to justice simply because of the misconduct of another set of errant solicitors, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SKK, his current solicitors in Suit 654. It did not appear to be in the interests of justice to place the burden on the Plaintiff to commence fresh proceedings against SKK, when the present breach in Suit 654 was through no fault of his.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Show Cause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I adjourned the proceedings to allow the parties to show cause and to address me on whether costs should be awarded personally against the errant solicitors in this case and whether they should be referred to the Law Society of Singapore (“LSS”) for any actions it deems fit. I issued these directions because it was unfair that the Plaintiff was made to bear the previous costs orders for: (a) SKK’s absence from the four PTCs; and (b) SUM 3828 on 4 November 2022. This deplorable state of affairs was attributable primarily to the solicitors of SKK in mishandling the case. Further, as I have explained above, the present appeal was necessitated by the contumelious conduct of the solicitors from SKK. Therefore, while costs would ordinarily follow the event when I allow the appeal, it would be unfair to make a costs order against the Defendant in relation to this appeal. Further, it also would be unfair to hold the Plaintiff liable for costs arising from this appeal when it was the contumelious conduct of the solicitors from SKK which made this appeal necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At the show cause hearing on 22 February 2023, however, Mr Foo stated that the Plaintiff would not be made to bear the costs arising from the previous costs orders. Mr Foo also assured the Court that the Plaintiff would also not be liable to any costs order arising from this appeal. Mr Foo categorically stated that the past and present solicitors would be bearing these costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Upon my direction that such an undertaking should be made in writing, Mr Foo provided a letter dated 23 February 2023 (“Mr Foo’s 23 February 2023 Letter”). In Mr Foo’s 23 February 2023 Letter, Mr Foo states that, following his discussions with Mr Singh, he and Mr Singh undertake to personally bear and be liable for the costs arising from the previous costs orders as well as costs arising from this appeal. Though the dates of the previous costs orders in Mr Foo’s 23 February 2023 Letter were incorrect, Mr Foo has since clarified that SKK will be liable for the costs order of $3,000 payable to the Defendant which was made at the PTC on 14 June 2022. Mr Foo also undertakes to personally bear and be liable for: (a) the costs payable to the Defendant for the absence of SKK’s solicitor from the PTC on 27 September 2022; (b) the costs order of $2,000 payable to the Defendant which was made after the hearing of SUM 3828 on 4 November 2022; and (c) the costs arising from this appeal. For completeness, Mr Foo also states that the Plaintiff would not be charged for the work related to this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In view of the undertaking in writing by Mr Foo, it is not necessary to consider whether costs should be awarded personally against the errant solicitors in this case. Since the errant solicitors of the Plaintiff have taken full responsibility for the mishandling of the Plaintiff’s case, it is not necessary to refer the errant solicitors to the LSS for any action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As stated in Mr Foo’s 23 February 2023 Letter, therefore, the Plaintiff’s solicitors and not the Plaintiff are to bear the costs arising from the previous costs orders as well as costs arising from this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In summary, I make the following findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Second AR had the jurisdiction to decide on the merits of the prayers sought by the Plaintiff in SUM 3828. An assistant registrar generally does not have jurisdiction when he is asked to give another ruling on a point which has already been argued before and decided by a different assistant registrar. However, this was not the situation in the present case. Rather, at the PTC on 27 September 2022 before the First AR, neither SKK nor Mr Foo was given an opportunity by the First AR to be heard or to submit on whether the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC was an appropriate consequence for SKK’s failure to comply with the earlier direction at the PTC on 23 August 2022. The First AR refused to acknowledge that Mr Foo was representing the Plaintiff and ordered the “unless order” made on 23 August 2022 to be operative and struck out the Plaintiff’s SOC. There were no arguments made at that time on the merits of whether the consequence of the solicitor’s absence on 27 September 2022 should be a striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC. Therefore, the Second AR had the jurisdiction to hear the parties on whether further extension of time should be granted to the Plaintiff, and whether the 27 September 2022 Order should be set aside and the Plaintiff’s SOC be reinstated.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The conduct of SKK’s solicitors was plainly contumelious and unsatisfactory. Their repeated absences from the PTCs while having conduct of Suit 654 were clearly unacceptable. However, the striking out of the Plaintiff’s SOC due to the failure of SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs was a disproportionate consequence in this case. There was no suggestion by the parties before the Second AR or on appeal that the conduct of SKK’s solicitors was instigated by the Plaintiff himself or attributable to the Plaintiff’s conduct. The First AR was understandably displeased with the conduct of SKK’s solicitors, but he should not have allowed the “unless order” to be operative as it would adversely affect the Plaintiff’s claim. The effect of having his SOC struck out would lead to the Plaintiff being unable to obtain justice for his road traffic accident case for the second time. This was surely through no fault of the Plaintiff but the result of his errant solicitors’ contumelious conduct. More significantly, it was clear that the Defendant had not suffered any irremediable prejudice due to the delay arising from the failure of SKK’s solicitors to attend the PTCs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On the issue of costs, Mr Foo, in his letter dated 23 February 2023, rightly acknowledges that the past and present solicitors for the Plaintiff will bear all costs including the costs of this appeal. Accordingly, it may not be necessary for this Court to refer the errant solicitors to the LSS for any action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the reasons above, I allow the appeal. I shall now hear the parties on the appropriate quantum of costs to be paid by the past and present solicitors for the Plaintiff for the absence of SKK’s solicitor from the PTC on 27 September 2022, as well as this appeal.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Ho Chew (H C Law Practice) for the plaintiff/appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wee Anthony and Christine Chiam (Titanium Law <br/>Chambers LLC) for the defendant/respondent. </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
