The key sub-issue here was, where the owner steps in to pay for bunker fuel which was the contractual responsibility of the charterer to pay, whether the moneys paid by the owner could be considered as an “amount due under” the charter for the purposes of Clause 18.

There was no direct contract between Marchand and Olam. After the voyage had been performed under the Voyage Charter, there was demurrage incurred under the Voyage Charter. Following negotiations, Olam and Sinco agreed on or around 21 December 2022 that the sum due under the Voyage Charter was US$190,112 (being demurrage in the sum of US$192,812 less dunnage and hold cleaning in the sum of US$2,700). It was undisputed that Olam therefore owed the sum of US$190,112 to Sinco under the Voyage Charter.

The 11 January 2023 Notice informed Olam that Sinco was in breach of the terms of the Charterparty by failing to pay hire due and owing to Marchand, as well as set out the amount claimed by Marchand from Sinco. It expressly referred to, and set out the entirety of, Clause 18, and instructed Olam to “treat this message as Notice of Lien over any balance of freight(s) and/or hire(s) and/or demurrage due”. Marchand requested that Olam confirm the amounts due from Olam to Sinco, and to arrange for payment of the said amounts to Marchand, not to Sinco. Olam was warned that Marchand reserved the right to recover these amounts from Olam, should Olam fail to take heed of the 11 January 2023 Notice by making payment to Sinco.

</div> It was not disputed that the 11 January 2023 Notice was formally valid and had been issued to Olam before Olam made payment of the US$190,112. However, Sinco informed Olam: (a) that Sinco objected to Marchand’s exercise of the lien; (b) that <span class="font-italic">no sums</span> were due and owing under the Charterparty; and (c) that Olam was to pay the US$190,112 owed to Sinco, not to Marchand.

Olam informed Marchand that, in order to avoid the risk of having to pay twice, Olam would hold onto the moneys and make payment in accordance with any agreement subsequently reached between Marchand and Sinco. No agreement materialised. Olam also offered to pay the US$190,112 into escrow pending resolution of the dispute between Marchand and Sinco.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As I have summarised at the outset, OA 138 turned on two issues: whether Marchand’s exercise of Clause 18 <span class="font-italic">as against Olam</span> was affected by: (a) the existence of a dispute between Marchand and Sinco as to whether there were any “amounts due under [the Charterparty]”; and/or (b) the Arbitration Clause. Before setting out my analysis, I must emphasise that the focus in this case was on Olam’s position as a sub-charterer who was not a party to the Charterparty. The question was whether Olam was required to pay Marchand the US$190,112 following Marchand’s exercise of the lien through issuing the 11 January 2023 Notice to Olam. In other words, the crux was the obligations of a sub-charterer in Olam’s position. It is critical to distinguish this from issues relating to the contractual rights and obligations as between Marchand and Sinco <span class="font-italic">under the Charterparty</span>. The question was <span class="font-italic">not </span>whether Marchand’s exercise of Clause 18 was proper or improper as a matter between Marchand and Sinco under the terms of the Charterparty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 To resolve the two issues, I first considered the sub-issue of the proper interpretation of Clause 18, which was whether Marchand’s payment of the unpaid bunkers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Integr8 Sum) on behalf of Sinco was an “amount due under [the Charterparty]” under Clause 18. I then considered Marchand’s submission that there was no “dispute” referrable to arbitration under the Arbitration Clause, before returning to address the two main issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Integr8 Sum was an amount due under the Charterparty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under Clause 18, Marchand was to have a lien on all demurrages. This would include <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">demurrage owing from Olam to Sinco</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> under the Voyage Charter. This was not contested by Sinco. In my judgment, the </span>US$190,112 could therefore in principle have been subject to the lien in Clause 18.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 However, Clause 18 further states that the lien would be “for any amounts due under this Charter”. This therefore raised the question of whether the Integr8 Sum was an “amount due under [the Charterparty]”. Sinco submitted that the terms of the Charterparty did not allow the exercise of the lien in relation to Marchand’s payment of bunkers on behalf of Sinco. However, Sinco did not provide any authority for this submission. In its written submissions, Sinco did not advance any explanation for its position and did not highlight whether there were any specific terms which would clearly exclude the claim for the Integr8 Sum, given the broad language employed by Clause 18. Neither was counsel for Sinco able to point to any such specific term when I queried him on the basis of this submission at the hearings on 7 September 2023 and 18 October 2023. Counsel for Sinco instead confirmed that this submission was based <span class="font-italic">only</span> on his interpretation of the plain language of Clause 18.

Sinco did not pay Integr8, even though Sinco was obliged to do so. Marchand paid Integr8 when Integr8 threatened to arrest the Vessel if the bunkers were not paid for. This would have been to the detriment of Marchand, as the disponent owner of the Vessel, and to the ongoing operation of the Charterparty. Marchand therefore paid the Integr8 Sum for the bunkers, on behalf of Sinco.

This was on the basis that it was the charterers who were obliged under a clause of the charterparty to pay for shortfall in the fuel on redelivery, a claim that the charterers did not submit on and therefore did not appear to dispute (at [19]). The court in <span class="font-italic">Alpha Marine</span> considered and dismissed the charterers’ submission that there should be an implied term that would prevent an owner from intervening and withdrawing their authority to collect freight, on the basis that owners were already under an obligation to account to the charterers for any excess collected over the amounts due under the charterparty (at [44]–[55]).

</div> This meant that Sinco was under an express obligation to provide and pay for all the fuel during the term of the hire. I found that the bunkers had been provided by Integr8 to the Vessel during the term of Sinco’s hire under the Charterparty (above at [23]). Thus, under the terms of the Charterparty, fuel disbursements to Integr8 were indeed the responsibility of Sinco as the charterers. Marchand had paid the Integr8 Sum when it was the responsibility of Sinco to do so, and Marchand was entitled to be reimbursed. This placed this case firmly within the principles identified in <span class="font-italic">Time Charters</span> and <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Bearing these principles in mind, I was satisfied that on the facts of this case, the payment by Marchand to Integr8, of the Integr8 Sum, would be regarded as an “amount due under this Charter” for the purposes of Clause 18. Consequently, Marchand would be entitled to exercise a lien over the demurrage owing from Olam to Sinco, being the sum of US$190,112. However, the forgoing analysis is <span class="font-italic">potentially</span> subject to one caveat, as Sinco disputed that any sum was owing under the Charterparty and submitted that the use of the Integr8 Sum as justification for the exercise of the lien by Marchand, was an issue that ought to have been referred to arbitration.

Marchand’s case was that there was <span class="font-italic">no dispute</span> referrable to arbitration, based on purported admissions by Sinco in the OA 886 Affidavit (above at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, this raised two <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> sub-issues. First, whether there was a “dispute” within the meaning of the Arbitration Clause, which therefore had to be referred to arbitration. Second, even if there was a dispute that was referrable to arbitration <span class="font-italic">as between Marchand and Sinco</span>, whether this prevented Marchand from exercising the lien under Clause 18 <span class="font-italic">as against Olam</span>. I therefore distinguished, on one hand, the issue of the <span class="font-italic">propriety</span> of Marchand’s exercise of the lien as a matter of contract between Marchand and Sinco under the terms of the Charterparty, from the distinct question of whether Marchand was thereby <span class="font-italic">prevented</span> from exercising the lien as against Olam, who was a third party that was not privy to the Charterparty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In so far as the first sub-issue was concerned, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>., whether there was a “dispute” that fell within the scope of the Arbitration Clause, I observed that the authorities established a high threshold before the court would find that something fell outside the scope of a “dispute” as defined in arbitration clauses. Marchand relied on the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>”). As highlighted by Marchand itself, in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>, the Court of Appeal set a very high bar before the court would be willing to find that there was no “dispute” referrable to arbitration. The Court of Appeal held that the court would refuse to grant a stay in favour of arbitration “only in obvious cases” and that such an exception would “<span class="font-italic">only be made where there has been a clear and unequivocal admission</span>” such that it could “<span class="font-italic">be said that there exists no dispute mandatorily referable to arbitration</span>” [emphasis in original] (at [59]). In other words, a finding that there was <span class="font-italic">no dispute</span> was truly exceptional. The Court of Appeal provided further guidance (at [49], [61], and [62]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it <span class="font-italic">is</span> sufficient for a defendant to simply assert that he disputes or denies the claim in order to obtain a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration … the court is not to examine whether there is “in fact” a dispute, or a genuine dispute … A dispute that a claimant was always likely to succeed in remains, until adjudicated on, none the less a dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">In essence, we are of the view that generally speaking, the court ought to be ordinarily inclined to find that there has been a denial of a claim in all but the clearest of cases. It should not be astute in searching for admissions of a claim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the lack of a meritorious defence does not entitle a claimant to bypass the prior agreed dispute resolution mechanism <span class="font-italic">unless the defendant has admitted the claim</span>, and an open-and-shut case must be distinguished from an admission … The court … will therefore be very slow to allow a claimant to circumvent the arbitration agreement unless there has indeed been a clear and unequivocal admission by the defendant … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Notably, the examples given by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> of what would amount to a “clear and unequivocal” admission were rather stark. The first example (based on <span class="font-italic">Getwick Engineers Limited v Pilecon Engineering Limited </span>[2002] 1020 HKCU 1) was where there had been an attempt to pay the amount claimed by way of a cheque, but where the cheque was subsequently dishonoured. Such a cheque, which would be treated as cash, would be regarded a clear and unequivocal admission of both liability and quantum (<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [57] and [59]). The second example was the case where the defendant admits to liability but simply says that they are unable to pay, which would similarly be a clear and unequivocal admission (<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [59]). I would add that in <span class="font-italic">Gulf International Holding Pte Ltd v Delta Offshore Energy Pte Ltd</span> [2023] SGHC 151, another case which Marchand also relied on, the debtor had simply sought multiple extensions of time to make repayment and did not dispute liability until before the court (at [32]). To bring the present case within the scope of the exception in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>, Marchand therefore needed to satisfy the court that any purported statements by Sinco rose to the exceptional level of such a “clear and unequivocal” admission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 While Marchand initially proceeded on the basis of the list of creditors in the OA 886 Affidavit filed for Sinco’s Scheme of Arrangement application (above at [11(b)]), to support its submission that Sinco had admitted that it owed a sum of US$2,755,404.21 to Marchand, Marchand subsequently narrowed its case when it filed its further written submissions to focus only on the Integr8 Sum. Unlike the initial sum of US$2,755,404.21, the Integr8 Sum appeared to have surer footing because of Sinco’s clearly expressed intention to repay its bunker creditors (which included and named Integr8) in the OA 886 Affidavit and Integr8’s undisputed assignment of the entire claim for the Integr8 Sum to Marchand (above at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Nevertheless, Sinco <span class="font-italic">d</span><span class="font-italic">id</span> dispute the use of the Integr8 Sum as the justification for the exercise of the lien by Marchand and submitted that this claim ought to have been resolved by arbitration. Notably, I observed that while Sinco contended that the sum of US$406,401.47 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Integr8 Sum) did not come within the ambit of “any amounts due under [the] Charter” in Clause 18, this was not, based on Sinco’s limited submissions, because it disputed that the US$406,401.47 was in fact owed by Sinco to Intgr8 or that the claim for this sum had not been assigned from Integr8 to Marchand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Leaving aside the merits of Sinco’s submissions, there was nevertheless arguably a “dispute” for the purposes of the Arbitration Clause. Following the guidance of the Court of Appeal in</span><span class="font-italic"> Tjong Very Sumito</span>, the mere assertion of a dispute would be sufficient. An open-and-shut case must be distinguished from a clear and unequivocal admission. I therefore had some difficulty accepting Marchand’s submission that Sinco had made a sufficiently “clear and unequivocal” admission in the OA 886 Affidavit, such that I would be able to find that there was no “dispute” referrable to arbitration under the Arbitration Clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Marchand was entitled to exercise the lien against Olam</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">However, as I have foreshadowed, even if there was a dispute for the purposes of the Arbitration Clause, there was still the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">distinct</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> issue of whether the presence of such </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a dispute prevented Marchand’s exercise of the lien under Clause 18 </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">as against Olam</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. In my view, it </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">did not, and Olam was therefore entitled to make payment of the </span>US$190,112 to Marchand for the purposes of these proceedings. I reached this conclusion <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">for three reasons.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">First, </span>Olam was not a party to the Charterparty, which was between Marchand and Sinco. Hence, Olam was not privy to the Arbitration Clause. Olam was therefore <span class="font-italic">not</span> bound to arbitrate pursuant to the Arbitration Clause and Olam was entitled to a determination by the court of its rights and obligations as a sub-charterer in receipt of the 11 January 2023 Notice. For this same reason, Olam likewise had no control over any arbitration proceedings between Marchand and Sinco (if any) and had no means of compelling them to take out arbitration proceedings to resolve their dispute. Despite Sinco’s submission that the issue (of whether the Integr8 Sum was an amount due under the Charterparty) was one that ought to have been resolved by arbitration, no steps had been taken to arbitrate the dispute by either Marchand or Sinco. Unless either Marchand or Sinco took such steps, the dispute between them would continue to be left in the doldrums. This was despite Olam’s expressed willingness and readiness to pay out the sum of US$190,112. Olam was certainly not in any position to adjudicate the dispute between Marchand and Sinco. In my view, the scope of a sub-charterer’s obligations upon their receipt of a valid notice of exercise of a lien should not depend on, or be significantly altered by, the presence of an arbitration clause or the presence of a subsisting dispute referrable to arbitration as between the owner and charterer. This is important because the effect of Clause 18 extended beyond the parties privy to the Charterparty and could affect third party sub-charterers such as Olam, and indeed sub-sub-charterers (if any exist) further along the chain (<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> at [30]). It is established that, given its effect on third parties to the charterparty in which the clause is contained, Clause 18 does not operate solely as a contractual right (<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> at [34]). The lien in Clause 18 is ubiquitous (<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> at [1] and [4]), and much of its effect and purpose would be denuded if any apparent dispute along the chain would be sufficient to preclude its exercise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, the Arbitration Clause only required that <span class="font-italic">the parties to the Charterparty</span> submit to arbitration where there was a dispute arising out of or in connection with the Charterparty. There was nothing in the language of the Arbitration Clause that constrained the operation of the lien under Clause 18 against a sub-charterer – for example, by imposing the need for an arbitration to have been commenced or an arbitral award to be presented before the lien could be exercised – if it could be so exercised pursuant to the plain terms of Clause 18. From the perspective of the sub-charterer against whom notice of exercise of a lien was issued, there was similarly no requirement in law that the notice <span class="font-italic">must</span> be accompanied by proof of a final determination of any dispute between the owner and charterer, such as an arbitral award. Counsel for Sinco was unable to point to any authority to justify the imposition of such a requirement.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I therefore affirmed my prior analysis that the claim for the Integr8 Sum would be regarded as an “amount due under this Charter” for the purposes of Clause 18. The lien could therefore be exercised in respect of the US$190,112, to secure the claim for the Integr8 Sum, by issuing notice of the exercise of Clause 18 to Olam (<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> at [37] and [58]). I only qualified this analysis to the extent of limiting this determination to Olam’s position as a sub-charterer with notice. Marchand’s exercise of the lien by way of the 11 January 2023 Notice was therefore valid <span class="font-italic">in so far as Olam </span><span class="font-italic">was concerned</span>. I emphasise that this conclusion does not purport to determine the merits of any arbitrable dispute <span class="font-italic">as between Marchand and Sinco</span> that falls within the scope of the Arbitration Clause, such as the issue of the <span class="font-italic">propriety</span> of Marchand’s exercise of Clause 18 as a matter of contract between Marchand and Sinco under the terms of the Charterparty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Third, the case of <span class="font-italic">Care Shipping Corporation v Latin American Shipping Corporation</span> [1983] 1 QB 1005 (“<span class="font-italic">Care Shipping</span>”) provided direct support for this approach. <span class="font-italic">Care Shipping</span> was cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Diablo</span>, but not on this specific point. Nonetheless, I found <span class="font-italic">Care Shipping</span> highly persuasive given the many factual parallels with this case. In <span class="font-italic">Care Shipping</span>, the owners of the vessel, Care, gave notice of the lien in cl 18 of the NYPE standard form to the sub-charterer and sub-sub-charterer of the vessel. The lien in that case was not materially different from Clause 18 here. The head charterer, Naviera, similarly disputed the exercise of such lien on the basis that no amounts were due under the head charter. This dispute between the owner and the head charterer was the subject of an <span class="font-italic">ongoing</span> arbitration at the time of the litigation. Both the owner, Care, and the head charterer, Naviera, agreed that it was the outcome of the ongoing arbitration that would finally determine the rights <span class="font-italic">as between Care and Naviera</span>. The purpose of the litigation was to determine to whom the moneys purportedly subject to the lien was to be paid in the time being (at 1009F–1010F). The court ruled in favour of the owners, holding that the moneys claimed under the liens belonged to them. This was notwithstanding the presence of an arbitration clause in the head charter between the owner and head charterer, and notwithstanding the fact that arbitration proceedings were still underway, and no arbitration award had been issued at that stage. Applying <span class="font-italic">Care Shipping</span> to the present case, the fact that there appeared to be a dispute between Marchand and Sinco that could have been referrable to arbitration <span class="font-italic">d</span><span class="font-italic">oes not</span> prevent Marchand’s exercise of the lien under Clause 18 as against a sub-charterer, Olam. Having received notice by the 11 January 2023 Notice, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Olam </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">was therefore entitled to make payment of the </span>US$190,112 to Marchand in discharge of Olam’s debt to Sinco (<span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> at [29]–[30]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Therefore, for the reasons above, I held that Marchand was entitled to exercise its lien pursuant to Clause 18 of the Charterparty dated 29 April 2022 in respect of the US$190,112 owed by Olam to Sinco. Payment of this sum was to be made to Marchand, with the final outcome of the arbitration (if any) being determinative of the rights to this money as between Marchand and Sinco <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>. As this sum had been paid by Olam into court, I ordered that there be payment out to Marchand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Olam had proposed certain amendments to prayers 1 and 2 of OA 138, to clarify the scope of those prayers.

I therefore granted prayers 1 and 2 of OA 138, as amended by Olam.
