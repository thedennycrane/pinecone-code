In the course of his appointment as director and CEO, Kumar discovered that Ng had been paid by the Plaintiff $133,495.90 (“Ng’s sales commission”) allegedly for commission earned between 28 January 2011 and 28 October 2014, even though Ng was not an employee of the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Kumar similarly discovered that Wong was also paid sales commission by the Plaintiff of $174,988.34 (“Wong’s sales commission”) for the same period as Ng when he too was not an employee of the Plaintiff.

Kumar deposed that Bala himself was a salaried employee of Ice Mobile with no commission entitlements. Yet, Bala paid himself US$512,000 (which approximated S$698,419.20) as “consultancy” fees over and above his salary. Bala had initially joined Ice Mobile as a consultant in 2009 pending its takeover by Ice Corp. It was Bala who came up with a formula to pay the Defendants their commission.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Kumar identified another person as being involved in the unauthorised commissions paid to both Defendants. That person was Cindy Soh (“Cindy”), the Human Resources &amp; Finance Manager of Ice Mobile. She was neither an employee nor director of the Plaintiff, but was apparently a director of Radius for about 6 months in 2006.

</div>.  As a result, Logan requested Bala to resign as CEO which Bala did on 29 October 2013 shortly after Kumar was appointed (see [10]). He said Kumar’s appointment to conduct a due diligence exercise was done after consultation with Ramen in September 2013.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Believing from Kumar’s preliminary findings that the businesses of Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff were being mismanaged, Logan then ordered a full investigation of both companies. He discovered therefrom the unauthorised commissions paid to the Defendants by Bala and the sum of US$512,000 that Bala paid himself. He deposed that Bala’s undocumented commission scheme in effect guaranteed preposterous amounts of money to the Defendants even where the Plaintiff was not doing well. Those payments were never sanctioned by the board of directors of either Ice Mobile or the Plaintiff. Hence, the Plaintiff was entitled to recover them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Logan surmised that Bala had a hand in the new competing businesses set up by Ng and Wong. He further suspected Bala of being instrumental in the Defendants’ incorporation of an offshore shell company. He opined that Bala protected the Defendants by paying them the unauthorised commissions and then took them away to create the new business they now have.  Indeed, he thought the three persons were setting up companies on the side while working for and being paid by Ice Mobile.

Over time however, he and Ramen came to realise that Laszlo was a conman and a fraudster who foisted scams on them and caused Ramen to lose US$2.4m in the process. Logan further alleged that Laszlo operated under multiple names, passports and aliases.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Plaintiff’s last witness was Ramen who is a non-resident director of the Plaintiff, based in Belgium. In his AEIC, Ramen deposed he holds 92.61% of the shares in Bakel which in turn holds 30% of the shares in the Plaintiff as well as Ice Mobile. Like Logan, Ramen is involved in numerous businesses as an investor. He had also resided in Singapore previously and managed companies here for 7 years

He only became aware of the unauthorised commissions paid to the Defendants by Bala and Bala’s payment of US$512,000.00 to himself when told by Kumar in Sweden where they met in October 2015. Ramen testified in board meetings he attended with Bala, the latter never brought up the issue of commissions nor was it a subject matter on the agenda.

The Plaintiff only had two employees namely, Bala himself and Wong’s wife Allyce Kwong, whose services were terminated when Kumar became the CEO.

</div> The burden of proof lies on the person who makes a positive assertion. That the Defendants ultimately chose not to call Cindy as witness is a negative factor that the court takes into consideration – it gives rise to an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act Cap 97, that had Cindy testified, her evidence would not have been favourable to the Defendants.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As noted earlier at [59], the Defendants tried to suggest that Cindy was primarily responsible for the payment of the unauthorised commissions.  However, despite their written and oral testimony, there was not a single document that the Defendants (nor Bala, for that matter) could rely on, which supported their claim that Cindy was the person who requested the Defendants to open the Singapore accounts, let alone that she was primarily responsible for paying the unauthorised commissions. Indeed, the court’s observations at [75] and questioning of Bala at [96] showed such a suggestion to be completely baseless. Moreover, the Defendants’ failure to procure Cindy as a witness at [95] spoke volumes of the credibility of such a suggestion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the Plaintiff’s closing submissions

It is also undisputed that neither Ng nor Wong have paid taxes on or declared the unauthorised commissions to either the Malaysian or Singapore tax authorities. The court disbelieves Ng’s claim that he did not get round to declaring the same as his income. It was deliberate concealment by the Defendants to avoid paying income tax in both countries.

The court acceded to the request and both parties filed their further submissions on 31 August 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The Plaintiff pointed out in its further submissions that the High Court judgment made specific findings of fact and law in respect of the issues in this case which this court should accept/adopt. Amongst the findings made by the Malaysian court were the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the reasons given by Ng for the opening of the Singapore accounts were dismissed as disingenuous – the High Court noted that the Plaintiff was incorporated on 6 September 2010 (see [1]) but the Singapore accounts were opened months earlier in April 2010;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there was no documentary evidence to support the Sessions court’s findings of an internal arrangement between Ice Mobile and the Plaintiff that justified payments by the Plaintiff to Ng. As a director of Ice Mobile, Ng would have been able to produce documents to support the existence of an internal arrangement if the same existed. The Malaysian court opined Ng was not telling the truth;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there were no documents that could show the existence of a sales commission scheme covering the years 2011–2013 and the period January–June 2014;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ng was not an honest witness. He deliberately avoided treating the Plaintiff’s payments as employment income giving rise to a conclusion that he was evading income tax, an offence in both Singapore and Malaysia;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Sessions court judge failed to appreciate the significance of the civil suit brought by the Plaintiff in Singapore against Ng to recover the sums paid to him on the basis that Ng received the sums fraudulently, dishonestly or wrongfully;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Ng should have brought his claim for RM43,620 by way of a counterclaim in the Singapore action as all previous payments had been made by the Plaintiff and Singapore was the proper forum. His action was suspicious and gave rise to an ulterior motive on the part of Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Plaintiff then went on in its further submissions to cite the law (and cases) on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, recognition of a foreign judgment, issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. In short, the Plaintiff wanted this court to give due weight to the High Court judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The Defendants on the other hand urged this court not to give any weight to the High Court judgment and submitted it should not influence the outcome of these proceedings.  In brief, the Defendants’ reasons were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It would be premature to rely on the High Court judgment as it was not final – Ng had appealed against it to the Court of Appeal;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the subject matter of the Sessions court and High Court Judgments was Ng’s claim against Ice Mobile which is separate and distinct from the Plaintiff’s claim against him in the First Suit; there are no overlaps;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ng’s Malaysian suit involved issues of his resignation and his purported failure to collect payments which were matters not pleaded in the First Suit and are not before this court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) although the subject matter of the First Suit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Plaintiff’s claim against Ng, did not form the subject matter of Ng’s Malaysian Suit, the Malaysian High Court made a finding that there was no evidence to justify payment of commission by the Plaintiff to Ng between 2011 and 2014;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Malaysian High Court took the view that the due diligence exercise undertaken by Kumar was important evidence even though the due diligence report itself was not evidence that was before the Malaysian proceedings; neither was it produced in these proceedings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the Malaysian High Court had made adverse findings on Ng’s character and credibility even though trial of his claim was conducted before the Sessions Court below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The Defendants submitted that any assessment of the credibility of Ng in these proceedings ought to be made based solely on the trial and evidence that was before this court. They added that no weight should be given to the Malaysian High Court’s observations that the Sessions Court judge failed to understand the significance of the Plaintiff’s two suits against the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Since this court finds in favour of the Plaintiff against both Defendants, there is no necessity in any event to rely on Ng’s Malaysian Suit or the High Court judgment based on the principles of issue estoppel, <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and/or the comity of nations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 At this juncture, the court needs to address one more issue concerning Logan’s <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> as the owner of Skantek.
