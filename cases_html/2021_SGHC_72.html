To this end, the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) contains a multitude of complementary provisions that facilitate a fast, low cost adjudication system designed to expeditiously adjudicate and determine, on a temporary but nevertheless binding basis, disputes in relation to progress payment claims made under a construction contract to which the Act applies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Act and the adjudication mechanism provided therein are, however, not the <span class="font-italic">panacea</span> for any and all disputes that may arise in relation to progress payments under a construction contract. Indeed, s 4 of the Act contains, among others, provisions prescribing when the Act would <span class="font-italic">not</span> apply at all. For example, <br/>s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act provides that the Act would not apply to a terminated contract in the circumstances enumerated in that sub-section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On the other hand, in order to ensure that the purpose of the Act is not frustrated by ingenious drafting, the Act also imposes some restraints on the parties’ freedom to contract. One such example may be found in s 9, which renders “pay when paid” provisions in a construction contract unenforceable and of no effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Does the Act go so far as to render “pay when paid” provisions in a construction contract unenforceable notwithstanding the termination of the contract? In particular, where a term in a construction contract purports to suspend payments upon termination of the contract, and makes the contractor’s liability to pay any further sum owing to its sub-contractor contingent or conditional on the operation of some other contract or agreement, does s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act apply so as to render the entire Act <span class="font-italic">inapplicable</span> to the contract; or, would s 9 of the Act apply so as to render such a clause in the terminated contract unenforceable and of no effect? In short, what (if any) is the interplay between ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 These were some of the interesting questions that arose in Originating Summons No 1129 of 2020 (“OS 1129”), which concerned an application by the plaintiff to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, set aside an adjudication determination dated 27 May 2020 (the “AD”). I heard OS 1129 on 14 December 2020 and delivered oral grounds for my decision on 14 January 2021.

The plaintiff relied on s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to argue that the Act was inapplicable to the Payment Claim and the dispute that was referred to adjudication. The defendant on the other hand relied on s 9 of the Act to contend that the relevant portion of clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract was unenforceable and of no effect in the first place as it was or operated as a “pay when paid provision”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my view, considering where the battle lines were drawn in relation to the substantive application, the critical question that needed to be answered first was this – what was the interplay, if any, between ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act?

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s WS at para 26.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On the facts, the defendant only took steps to enforce the Leave Order in September 2020 by way of garnishee proceedings, almost two months after it had been served on the plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Kyle Sim, accepted that the plaintiff could not demonstrate any prejudice that had been caused as a result of the defect in the Leave Order. At the hearing before me, counsel for the defendant, Mr Ang Minghao, made an oral application for the defect in the Leave Order to be cured. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, the defect in the Leave Order was quite clearly an “irregularity” falling within O 2 r 2(1) of the ROC and which could be cured under O 2 r 2(2). In the circumstances of this case and particularly when there was no prejudice caused to the plaintiff as a result of the irregularity, I allowed the defendant’s oral application and exercised the court’s curative power to cure the defect in the Leave Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As noted at [14], the plaintiff also sought an extension of time to file OS 1129, in the event that I found that the Leave Order had been validly served and was not void. It was common ground between the parties that the relevant considerations in determining if an extension of time ought to be granted are the length of delay, the reason(s) for the delay, the merits of the intended application, and whether there was undue prejudice to the defendant if the extension of time was granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Having considered the circumstances of this case, the factors mentioned at [28], and the fact that both parties were prepared to and did present their respective arguments on the substantive issues arising in OS 1129, I exercised my discretion in favour of allowing the plaintiff an extension of time until 9 November 2020 when OS 1129 was filed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With the preliminary issues out of the way, I now turn to address the substantive issues in OS 1129.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the AD and the Leave Order should be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court’s supervisory jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The principles applicable when the court hears an application to set aside an adjudication determination are well established. In <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>, the Court of Appeal held at [71] that the court’s task in such an application is to “assess whether any mandatory provision under the Act has been breached”. In the present context, that provision would be s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act. It is also well-established that in making this assessment, the court does not and indeed, “cannot consider the merits of the adjudication determination”. In a case where no payment response is served by the adjudication respondent (as was the case with the plaintiff in OS 1129), the responses that an adjudication respondent may raise in the adjudication proceedings are limited to highlighting patent errors in the material properly before the Adjudicator (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [68]). It is in that sense that “whether there are patent errors is the decisive test for whether the adjudicator has breached his duty under s 17(3)” (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The test for what constitutes a patent error is also well established. In essence, it refers to “an error that is obvious, manifest or otherwise easily recognisable”. The above definition formulated by caselaw is now encapsulated in s 2 of the Act. Further, the error must be in “the <span class="font-italic">material</span> that is properly before an adjudicator” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [22]). As noted in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [23], by its very definition, patent errors would constitute an “exceptional and extremely narrow category of errors.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With the abovementioned principles in mind, I turn to the arguments raised. First, I accepted the Adjudicator’s finding that “the termination by the [plaintiff] on 12th March 2020 is valid” at face value.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> AD at para 295</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was a finding that went to the merits of the AD, and therefore could not be revisited by the court in a setting aside application. In my judgment, the defendant’s submissions as set out at [17]–[18] amounted to a backdoor attempt to review the merits of the underlying dispute; it sought to invite the court to consider whether it would have reached the same decision as the Adjudicator on that issue. As the court’s supervisory jurisdiction does not include an examination of the merits of the AD, I rejected the defendant’s submissions in that regard. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of termination of the Sub-Contract on the defendant’s right to submit payment claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Nevertheless, the finding of a valid termination of the Sub-Contract by the plaintiff did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that the defendant was therefore not entitled to submit any payment claims thereafter. On the contrary, the right of a party to submit a payment claim and the validity of any payment claim submitted after a construction contract has been terminated depends, first and foremost, on the terms of the contract which govern the parties’ rights; thus, the contract and its terms retain primacy. As clearly explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span> at [36] and re-emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Orion-One Residential Pte Ltd v Dong Cheng Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2020] SGCA 121 (“<span class="font-italic">Orion-One</span>”) at [48], the overarching role of the Act is only a “gap-filling” one. The contract and its terms remain the primary focus of the parties’ rights and obligations insofar as submission of progress payment claims are concerned; this remains true also for the submission of payment claims post-contract termination. It is in that sense that some provisions of the Act, for example ss 6 and 7, are applicable only where a contract is “<span class="font-italic">silent</span> as to the amount of a progress payment which a party is entitled to, or does not provide any mechanism for the valuation of construction work carried out or goods or services supplied” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 However, this is not to say that the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> function of the Act is limited to that of “gap-filling”. The Act also <span class="font-italic">limit</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> parties’ freedom to contract and certain provisions in the Act clearly and expressly do so. For example, s 9 of the Act effectively prohibits “pay when paid provisions” entirely (no matter how they may be described in the contract) by “rendering them completely unenforceable” (<span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>at [30]). These limitations have been put in place by the Legislature to ensure that the overarching purpose of the Act (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> of facilitating cash flow) is not otherwise stultified by allowing parties unlimited contractual freedom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Reverting to the case at hand, the central issue that I had to consider was whether s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act takes primacy over s 9 of the Act. The significance of an affirmative answer to this question is that the Act would <span class="font-italic">not </span>apply to “any terminated contract”, such as the Sub-Contract in this case, thereby rendering the applicability of s 9 of the Act a non-starter. At one level, it might <span class="font-italic">appear</span> that there is some tension between s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and s 9 of the Act. If so, the question remains whether any such apparent tension can be resolved by the application of accepted principles of statutory interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The interplay between sections 4(2)(c) and 9 of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Whether s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act takes primacy over s 9, or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>, is a matter of statutory interpretation. Under s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (the “IA”) an “interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law … shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object”. The correct approach to the purposive interpretation under s 9A of the IA was clearly set out and explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37]. The court’s task is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At the first step, the court determines the ordinary meaning of the words of the legislative provision with the aid of “a number of rules and canons of statutory construction, all of which are grounded in logic and common sense” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [38]). For example, one rule is the presumption that the “same word is to bear the same meaning throughout” a given legislation (<span class="font-italic">Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 461 and others </span>[2011] 4 SLR 777 at [19]). At the second step, the court begins by presuming that a statute is a coherent whole such that any specific purpose underlying a particular provision is not contrary to the general purpose (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [41]). In that regard, primary internal textual sources such as the long title of a statute, the words of the particular provision and other provisions, including the structure of the statute as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [44]) as well as secondary extraneous material such as Hansard may be helpful in indicating a provision’s specific purpose (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [43]). Ultimately, it must always be borne in mind that “the primary source of information as to the legislative intent should be the text itself” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As set out at [22], there were two possible competing interpretations of ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act. The first possible interpretation, as submitted by the plaintiff, was that s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act should be interpreted on its own and takes primacy over s 9 of the Act such that “pay when paid provisions” in <span class="font-italic">terminated</span> construction contracts remained enforceable as the Act would not apply at all to the terminated contract until the conditions in s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act had been met. The second possible interpretation, as submitted by the defendant, was that s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act was to be interpreted in light of s 9 of the Act such that “pay when paid provisions” in construction contracts, including a terminated contract, were strictly unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The plaintiff submitted that the applicability of s 9 of the Act “must necessarily flow from the contract in question being one [to which the Act] applies”.

Insofar as the Sub-Contract had been terminated, the Act was inapplicable to the payment dispute such that s 9 of the Act was also inapplicable.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s SWS at para 7.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> At the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Bill (Bill 38/2018) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (2 October 2018) vol 94), when Parliament sought to introduce the current s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, the then Minister of State for National Development Mr Zaqy Mohamad clearly stated that the preservation of rights to payment for construction companies “remains the principle that underpins the amendments”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I agreed with the defendant that s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act should be construed in context, having regard to the entire piece of legislation and not in isolation. In doing so, the court should strive to achieve a harmonious construction of provisions within the same statute, particularly where that construction would promote the purpose of the legislation and thereby, give effect to the intention of Parliament. As such, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act should be construed in light of the other provisions of the Act such as s 9. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 While I agreed with the plaintiff that s 4 sets out the parameters for when the Act does or does not apply, I disagreed that it is to be interpreted or given primacy in the sense contended for by the plaintiff. I found the plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">SEF </span>at [45(a)] misplaced. <span class="font-italic">SEF</span> was not concerned with and did <span class="font-italic">n</span><span class="font-italic">ot </span>touch on<span class="font-italic"> </span>the interpretation<span class="font-italic"> </span>of s 4 of the Act, either generally or in relation to <br/>s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) specifically. Judith Prakash J (as she then was) was summarising, in <span class="font-italic">general terms</span>, the basic requirements that a court, in exercising its supervisory powers under s 27 of the Act, should be concerned with. <span class="font-italic">SEF</span> does not stand as authority that s 4 of the Act takes primacy over other provisions in the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I also found the plaintiff’s reliance on certain parts of <span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>to be misplaced. The plaintiff focused on the Court of Appeal’s comment that a contractor making a claim for progress payments under the Act “must show that there is a basis for claiming such payment under the terms of the contract in question” (<span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>at [28], citing <span class="font-italic">Far East Square Pte Ltd v Yau Lee Construction (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Far East Square</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [30]). However, those very same paragraphs in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>and <span class="font-italic">Far East Square</span> clarified that the rationale for requiring a contractor to show such contractual basis for progress payments is that the right to be paid must first<span class="font-italic"> </span>crystallise <span class="font-italic">pursuant to the underlying </span><span class="font-italic">construction contract</span>. The Act therefore does not confer upon a contractor the right to be paid; it only facilitates the enforcement of such a right by, for example, providing for the process of making and receiving progress payment claims and responses in the manner stipulated when the underlying contract is silent on the same. The right upon which a contractor makes a claim for a progress payment remains a purely contractual right as opposed to a statutory one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It was therefore not open to the plaintiff to argue that the defendant could not possibly satisfy the requirement expounded at [45] (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, showing a contractual basis for a claim for progress payments) because clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract purportedly suspended all payments to the defendant after 12 March 2020 and made them contingent or conditional upon the completion of the “whole of the Main Contract Works”. The plaintiff’s argument was somewhat circular as it <span class="font-italic">assumed</span> that the relevant part of clause 9(b) was valid and enforceable in the first place. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>took pains to clarify, s 9 of the Act “limits the parties’ freedom to contract” by rendering “pay when paid provisions” completely unenforceable (at [30]). The plaintiff did not advance any submissions on the statutory limitation contained in s 9 of the Act to parties’ freedom to contract which clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract, in effect, sought to circumvent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In light of the context of the Act as a whole, s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act does not, in my judgment, take primacy over s 9 of the Act. The conclusion I have reached is consistent with and gives effect to the <span class="font-italic">raison d’</span><span class="font-italic">être </span>of the statutory framework, which was to ensure that sub-contractors are not left at the mercy of main contractors: (a) withholding payments for reasons <span class="font-italic">unrelated </span>to the subcontractors’ performance; and (b) making such payments contingent on performance of some other contract. In contrast, if the plaintiff’s interpretation was accepted, s 9 of the Act could easily be circumvented by dint of contract drafting, thereby rendering it otiose in many cases. I did not consider this to be a consequence intended by the Legislature; nor would it promote the purpose of the Act or s 9 in particular. Therefore, when s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act is construed to determine if the Act applies to a particular terminated construction contract, any termination and suspension of payment provisions in that contract are to be given effect <span class="font-italic">only if</span> they do<span class="font-italic"> not</span> fall foul of s 9 of the Act. In my view, such an interpretation would not only allow a harmonious construction of ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 to be achieved in circumstances where those provisions intersect, but would also be consistent with the purpose of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Following from [47], when an adjudicator construes a termination clause in a construction contract that also contains a provision on the suspension of further payments to the counterparty following termination of that contract, the adjudicator is in my judgment required to consider if that provision on suspension of payments also falls within the ambit of a “pay when paid provision” as defined in s 9 of the Act. If it does, the adjudicator is obliged to <span class="font-italic">disregard</span> it as that contractual provision is, under s 9 of the Act, treated as unenforceable and of no effect “in relation to any payment for construction work carried out…. under <span class="font-italic">the contract</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Whilst there is a dearth of caselaw on “pay when paid” provisions, I was able to draw support for the conclusions I reached at [47] from <span class="font-italic">AMJ Pte Ltd v AMK Pte Ltd</span> [2012] SCAdjR 581 (<span class="font-italic">“AMJ”</span>), which was a published adjudication determination of Mr Chow Kok Fong. <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">MJ</span> also involved a sub-contract which was terminated by the adjudication respondent. The learned adjudicator found at [62]–[67] that a number of  provisions in the sub-contract which purported, in various ways, to peg the adjudication respondent’s obligation to pay its sub-contractor to certain events occurring under the <span class="font-italic">main contract</span> were all caught by s 9 of the Act as “pay when paid provisions”. The adjudicator ruled that those provisions in the sub-contract were unenforceable and should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be accorded any effect in the adjudication. In essence, the adjudicator in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">MJ</span> ruled that s 9 of the Act was applicable notwithstanding that on the facts of the case, the underlying construction contract had been terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I conclude this section by highlighting that both ss 9(1) and 9(2) of the Act refer to a “pay when paid provision” in a “contract”. The term “contract” is, in turn, defined in s 2 of the Act as “a construction contract or a supply contract, <span class="font-italic">and includes a construction contract</span><span class="font-italic"> … that has been terminated</span>.” [emphasis added]. Thus, it is clear that Parliament intended for s 9 of the Act on the effect of “pay when paid” provisions to <span class="font-italic">also</span> apply to a <span class="font-italic">terminated </span><span class="font-italic">construction contract</span>. This serves to further fortify the conclusions I reached at [47].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Adjudicator failed to consider s 4(2)(c) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I turn now to consider whether the Adjudicator failed to have regard to s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act as contended for by the plaintiff. In short, I disagreed that the Adjudicator failed to consider s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act in the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Mr Sim for the plaintiff did not seriously contest the point that the relevant part of clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract was indeed a “pay when paid” provision within the meaning of s 9 of the Act. The Adjudicator found that clause 9(b), which made the liability to pay money “<span class="font-italic">contingent on the completion of the Main Contract works</span> which the [defendant] has no control of”, was “equivalent to a ‘pay when paid’ requirements and thus not valid” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agreed with the submissions advanced by the defendant that clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract did, in substance, operate as a “pay when paid” provision. On its plain wording, the operative part of clause 9(b), <span class="font-italic">viz,</span> <span class="font-italic">“No further payment shall be made to the Sub-Contractor </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">until the whole of the Main Contract </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Works has been completed</span>”, had the effect of making “<span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">the liability </span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">[of the plaintiff] to pay money owing … </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">contingent or conditional on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">the operation of any other contract or agreement</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">” </span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">[emphases added] (s 9(2)(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">c</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">) of the Act)</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">. As noted by the District Court in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">B</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">aek Jae Pte Ltd v K-Inc Konstruct Pte Ltd</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)"> [2018] SGDC 11 at [31], the wording of s 9</span><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1)">(2), and in particular, the use of the phrase “by whatever name called”, indicates that “the legislature intended to cast the net wide” with regard to the ambit and reach of s 9(1). In my judgment, the material part of clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract as highlighted above plainly contravenes both the letter and spirit of s 9 of the Act.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present case, a close reading of the AD as a whole and paragraph 295 in particular would demonstrate that the Adjudicator <span class="font-italic">did</span> in fact consider the interplay between ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act. The Adjudicator’s conclusion was that the termination of the Sub-Contract by the plaintiff was valid and that accordingly, no payment claim may be served by the defendant post-termination under clause 9(b). In my view, that was in substance a finding that s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act might be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> applicable, even if the Adjudicator did not expressly say so. In that same paragraph, the Adjudicator went on to consider the impact of s 9 of the Act on the material part of clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract and found that it was not valid on account of it being a “pay when paid” provision. The Adjudicator then concluded “that the submission of [the Payment Claim] <span class="font-italic">is valid</span>” [emphasis added]. In my view, the Adjudicator’s conclusion, read in context, was that the Payment Claim fell<span class="font-italic"> within the ambit of </span><span class="font-italic">the Act</span>. In fact, at paragraph 284 of the AD, the Adjudicator expressly noted and was mindful of the fact that he was, among others, also under a duty to consider if the Payment Claim fell within the ambit of the Act.

</div>
</div> I thus rejected the plaintiff’s contention that the Adjudicator had failed to consider s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act or that there was a failure by the Adjudicator to comply with s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Adjudicator failed to recognise any patent error in the material before him</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I also disagreed that the Adjudicator failed to recognise any patent errors in the material before him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 At paragraph 276 of the AD, the Adjudicator indicated that he had given “due and careful consideration to all the submissions, authorities and documents” before him. Paragraphs 283 and 284 of the AD also quite clearly indicated that the Adjudicator was mindful of his duty to “consider the material properly before [him] and consider <span class="font-italic">if there are patent errors</span>” [emphasis added], and that he should not merely rubber stamp the Payment Claim. For example, the Adjudicator considered whether the defendant had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the construction work which was the subject of the Payment Claim had been completed and the value of such work. This was particularly relevant in this case where the plaintiff failed to serve a payment response. In such a case, s 15(3) of the Act precludes the adjudication respondent from raising any objection in its adjudication response not contained in its payment response. Nor can the Adjudicator have regard to any such objections. The adjudication respondent’s response in the adjudication is, effectively, limited to highlighting to the Adjudicator patent errors in the material properly before the Adjudicator. Nonetheless, as part of his basic duty under s 17(2) of the Act to determine the adjudicated amount (if any), the Adjudicator proceeded to satisfy himself that the defendant had established, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis, that the construction works which formed the subject of the Payment Claim had been completed and the value of such works. In doing so, it was clear that the Adjudicator was following the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 There was, in my view, no failure on the Adjudicator’s part to recognise any patent errors, as contended by the plaintiff. The Adjudicator also did not rubber stamp the claim but assessed independently whether the Act applied, whether the defendant had carried out the works claimed in the Payment Claim and the value of those works up to the date the Sub-Contract was terminated by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I disagreed with the plaintiff that the Adjudicator failed to recognise a patent error in the material before him, failed to consider s 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act or breached his duty under s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. I was amply satisfied that the Adjudicator had properly discharged his duties under the Act in rendering the AD. In my judgment, the Adjudicator correctly considered clause 9(b) together with ss 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 9 of the Act. The Adjudicator’s approach was also consistent with the Court of Appeal’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu</span> at [30] and [31] regarding the limitation on parties’ freedom to contract under the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There was no dispute that the Sub-Contract was, apart from clause 9(b), silent on the submission of payment claims post-termination for work done up to the termination of the Sub-Contract. The Sub-Contract also did not contain any terms to the contrary. Thus, the Act, including s 10, could be applied to fill the gaps in the Sub-Contract as necessary. The submission of the Payment Claim by the defendant was thus valid and the AD could not be faulted in any way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In light of the conclusions I have reached, it was not necessary for me to consider the defendant’s alternative argument that s 36 of the Act would have applied so as to render the material part of clause 9(b) of the Sub-Contract void. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed OS 1129 with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. I fixed costs at $6,500 with disbursements to be agreed or, failing agreement, taxed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 After I made the orders at [61], Mr Sim made an oral application on behalf of the plaintiff for the security paid into court by the plaintiff to be released and paid out to the plaintiff. Mr Sim submitted that there was no longer a need for the security to remain in court or to be paid to the defendant. This was because on 12 November 2020, judgment in default of appearance had been entered by the plaintiff  against the defendant under Order 13 of the ROC for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a sum of $412,300 plus interest in HC/S 1058/2020 (“Suit 1058”) which had been commenced by the plaintiff against the defendant.

</div> As such, notwithstanding the dismissal of  OS 1129, there were no outstanding monies owed to the defendant once the liquidated judgment amount in Suit 1058 was set-off against the adjudicated sum under the AD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Mr Ang objected to the plaintiff’s application and stated that the defendant would be applying to set aside the default judgment against it in Suit 1058. Mr Ang contended that there would be irreparable damage if the default judgment was successfully set aside and the security, if released to the plaintiff, cannot be paid back. Mr Ang also submitted that in any case, but for OS 1129, the adjudicated amount determined under the AD would have been paid in June 2020. Alternatively, Mr Ang proposed that the issue of payment out be held over until the defendant’s application to set aside the default judgment in Suit 1058 is heard and the court gives directions in respect of the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In balancing both parties’ interests, I decided that the fairest option was to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>, at least for the time being.
