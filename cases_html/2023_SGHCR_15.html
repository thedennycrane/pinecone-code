These claims arise out of a set of transactions under which the first claimant transferred its assets to the third to fifth defendants, which the claimants allege was a transaction at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Bankruptcy Act”) read with s 329 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) then-in-force (“the Companies Act”). The third to fifth defendants argue that the claims against them are unsustainable, either on the basis of the claimants’ pleading alone, or in the light of the objective evidence and contemporaneous documents relating to the transactions. As an alternative to striking out, in HC/SUM 1967/2023 (“SUM 1967”), the third to fifth defendants ask that the claimants provide security for their costs in defending the claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The first claimant, Xiang Da Marine Pte Ltd (“Xiang Da”) was a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of freight and ship management.

Instead, the “consideration” for the transfer of the Vessels was based on their respective net book values, and “accounting entries” were purportedly made to the accounts of Xiang Da and CSC Oil to “set off against amounts that were allegedly owed by Xiang Da to CSC Oil and/or others”.

The debts and liabilities of NTC’s foreign subsidiaries like Xiang Da would be settled through direct repayment, write-offs and set-offs, and following which these subsidiaries would be dissolved. On 26 October 2016, the Reorganisation Proposal was approved by a majority of NTC’s shareholders, and subsequently, another resolution was passed on 20 December 2016 for NTCS to purchase through its subsidiaries, vessels owned by CSC Oil and its subsidiaries at their net book values.

</div> In oral submissions, the claimants’ counsel explained that this was significant because, since Xiang Da was in a parlous financial state at the time of the Transactions, its directors owed a duty to take into account the interests of Xiang Da’s creditors, and the fact that Xiang Da received no actual payment meant that Xiang Da’s creditors also received no benefit from the Transactions. The set-off, which did not benefit those creditors in any way, could not amount to consideration.

First, they argue that Xiang Da’s current financial situation had been wrongfully brought about by the Transactions for which the Defendants are responsible. Xiang Da’s ability to pursue its claims should therefore not be stifled by SFC. Secondly, they point out that the second claimant has obtained a liquidator’s indemnity from C&amp;G, and that C&amp;G would pay for any costs orders made in OC 194. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transactions at an undervalue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 For a transaction to come within s 98(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, which is made applicable to companies by s 329(1) of the Companies Act: (a) there must be a “transaction”; (b) taking place within the “relevant period”; (c) which was at an “undervalue” within the meaning of s 98(3); and (d) the company was “insolvent” at the time of the transaction (see <span class="font-italic">Mercator &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Noordstar NV v Velstra Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 667 (“<span class="font-italic">Mercator</span>”) at [21]).

In <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat and others v Attorney-General and another </span>[2022] 2 SLR 1018 (at [16]–[19]), the Court of Appeal explained the tests applicable to each of these limbs: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the test is whether the action has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleadings are concerned.

The inquiry includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. This limb also signifies that the process of the court must be used <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and must not be abused. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the question is whether the case is one where the court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice, such as where the claim is “plainly or obviously unsustainable”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 For the purposes of O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), a claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable either where it is “legally unsustainable” or “factually unsustainable” (see <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati 5” </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [39]–[40]). A claim is “legally unsustainable” where it would be clear as a matter of law that a party would not be entitled to the remedy sought even if it were to succeed in proving all the facts he offers to prove. A claim is “factually unsustainable” where it could be said with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is entirely without substance, which can be the case if it were clear beyond question that the facts pleaded are contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Defendants’ arguments in SUM 1965 focus on the <span class="font-italic">unsustainability </span>of the claimants’ claims, either on the basis of the pleadings alone, or when the pleaded facts are viewed together with the affidavit evidence adduced in SUM 1965. It is therefore apparent that the Defendants are relying on O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Since the Defendants rely on evidence to show that the Transactions were <span class="font-italic">not </span>at an undervalue and that Xiang Da was <span class="font-italic">not </span>insolvent at the material time (see [16] above), I understand the Defendants to be contending that the claimants’ claims are <span class="font-italic">factually </span>unsustainable for the purposes of O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). On the other hand, I understand the Defendants’ argument about the claimants’ omission to plead in the SOC facts showing that the net book value of the Vessels is significantly less than the value of the Vessels at the material time (see [15] above) as a contention that the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action for the purposes of O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), to the extent the claimants’ claims are premised upon the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, the Defendants’ argument that the claimants have “no basis” to allege that no consideration was provided because there had been no actual transfer of cash to Xiang Da (see [15] above), although framed in terms of saying that the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action, is in my view better understood as saying that the claimants’ claims are <span class="font-italic">legally </span>unsustainable, to the extent they are premised upon the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. This is so for two reasons. First, the Defendants’ point is that even if the claimants succeed in proving that there had been no actual transfer of cash, the claimants will not be any closer to showing that no consideration had been provided for the purposes of proving that the Transactions were at an undervalue within the meaning of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), since there is no requirement at law that contractual consideration must take the form of property moving from the promisee to the promisor. Secondly, whether the pleadings disclose a reasonable cause of action for the purposes of O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should be determined by reference to the pleadings <span class="font-italic">alone</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [23(a)] above). I do not think it appropriate for the court to view the pleadings in conjunction with the applicable legal principles and draw conclusions as to the <span class="font-italic">legal </span>strengths or weaknesses of the claimants’ pleaded case in determining whether a reasonable cause of action is disclosed. After all, the fact that a claimant’s case is weak and hence unlikely to succeed is no ground for striking out under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (see <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the light of the above, the following issues arise for consideration: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To the extent the claimants’ claims are premised on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, whether the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action against the Defendants?  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To the extent the claimants’ claims are premised on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, whether they are legally unsustainable because the pleaded facts, if proven, do not show that the Transactions had taken place at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the claimants’ claims are factually unsustainable because the affidavit evidence shows that the Transactions had not taken place at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the claimants’ claims are factually unsustainable because the affidavit evidence shows that Xiang Da had not been insolvent at the time of the Transactions and so s 98 of the Bankruptcy Act is in any event inapplicable? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In the event SUM 1965 is dismissed, whether the Defendants are entitled to SFC against the claimants? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimants’ claims premised on s 98(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) of the Bankruptcy Act disclose no reasonable cause of action against the Defendants?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The gist of the Defendants’ complaint is that the SOC contains no pleading as to the significance of the Vessels being transacted at their net book value, and specifically, that it had not been pleaded that the net book value of the Vessels was significantly less than their market or fair value at the material time. To recall, the claimants’ pleaded case is that the Transactions involved the disposal of the Vessels at their net book values. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Under our rules of civil procedure, the onus is on a claimant who commences a claim against a defendant to plead all “material facts” in respect of every cause of action that it chooses to pursue against the defendant, and furnish sufficient particulars for the defendant to have reasonable notice of the case it has to meet; “material facts” are those facts which are necessary to formulate a <span class="font-italic">complete </span>cause of action (see <span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata Lie v Citibank NA </span>[2015] 1 SLR 875 (“<span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata Lie</span>”) at [34];<span class="font-italic"> EA Apartments Pte Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Bek and others </span>[2017] 3 SLR 559 at [21]). Where the claimant omits such material facts, it can come no closer to succeeding in the cause of action pursued, even if all the pleaded facts are eventually proven. A defendant should therefore not have to undergo the expense of trial to have the claim thrown out, and it is entitled to have the claimant’s claim struck out on the basis that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action against it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The starting point of this analysis, therefore, is what are the “material facts” that a claimant must plead if it advances a claim founded upon an alleged transaction at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. Under that subsection, a transaction is at an undervalue if it is entered into by the grantor for a consideration the value of which is “significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth” of the consideration provided by the grantor. The focus is on a <span class="font-italic">comparison </span>of value between the consideration provided by the grantor and the consideration received from the grantee, from the perspective of the grantor (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Ltd v Leow Quek Shiong and other appeals</span> [2022] 2 SLR 158 (“<span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span>”) (at [24]–[25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Hence, the material fact that a claimant seeking to allege a transaction at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act must plead is that which <span class="font-italic">shows </span>that the value at which the asset had been disposed by the grantor (in other words, the consideration received) was significantly less than what it actually had been worth at the time of the transaction (in other words, the consideration provided). Therefore, typically, the claimant would state in its pleadings what, on its case, ought to be the value of the asset at the time of the transaction and the value at which the asset had been disposed of pursuant to the alleged undervalue transaction. In other cases, it can also be self-apparent from the pleaded facts that the value at which the asset was disposed is significantly less than its actual or market value at the material time – for example, where assets of objectively considerable value are disposed of for nominal consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With the above mind, I turn to the relevant parts of the SOC which aver that the sale of the Vessels took place at an undervalue, which are set out in full below:

None of the pleaded facts can show that the value at which the Vessels were disposed had been less or significantly less than what they had been worth at the time of the Transactions. The claimants simply plead that the Vessels were sold at their net book value. However, because there is no mention in the SOC as to what, on the claimants’ case, is the value of the Vessels at the material time, no significance can be attributed to the pleaded fact that the Vessels had been disposed of at net book value. A pleading that the Vessels had been sold at net book value is by itself of no consequence because the net book value of an asset is at any one point in time either below, approximate to or above its market value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For completeness, I add that this is not simply a case where the SOC is defective in not containing the necessary particulars – which might well be the case if the claimants had pleaded as a bare assertion that the net book value of the Vessels is lower than their actual value at the material time, but failed to plead <span class="font-italic">why</span>; the latter would constitute particulars to which its opponents are entitled, in order to properly understand the nature of the case against them. In this case, the claimants do not even plead as a bare assertion that the net book value of the Vessels was lower than their actual or market value at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I accept that the claimants do plead at the start of para 14(a) of the SOC that the Vessels were sold for a consideration that is “significantly less than the value of [the Vessels] in money or in money’s worth”. The claimants also plead at para 14(b) that the Vessels, subsequent to the Transactions, came to generate significant revenue for the Defendants. From these paragraphs, one may <span class="font-italic">surmise</span> that the claimants’ case is that the net book value of the Vessels would have been lower than what they were actually worth at the material time, given the substantial financial benefit that they came to generate for the Defendants subsequent to the Transactions. In my view, however, this cannot be read as a pleading of a material fact for the purposes of a cause of action under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. That these paragraphs give rise to a <span class="font-italic">suggestion </span>as to what the claimants’ claim <span class="font-italic">might </span>be means that there are multiple <span class="font-italic">possible </span>meanings associated with the claimants’ pleading, and is precisely <span class="font-italic">the very defect</span> that warrants the claimants’ claims being struck out. Since the burden is on the claimants to properly plead its case (see <span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata Lie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([30] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]), it is incorrect as a matter of principle to require the Defendants and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> the court to opt for a reading that is most favourable to the claimants in determining if the pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It has been emphasised that the court should only exercise its power to strike out in “plain and obvious” cases (see <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([27] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]). The conclusion that I have reached above does not detract from that caution. On the basis of the SOC as it stands, even if the claimants succeed in proving their pleaded case at trial – in particular, that the Defendants did, subsequent to the Transactions, generate substantial revenue from and obtained financial benefit from the use of the Vessels – none of the proven facts would allow the court to determine if the Transactions were at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. Irrespective of the quantum of financial benefit obtained by the Defendants from the Transactions, whether the Vessels had been disposed for a lesser consideration than what they were actually worth still comes to be measured on the basis of what they had been worth before or at the time of the Transactions, and there is no basis on which that assessment can take place since the claimants plead no facts pertaining to what the market or fair value of the Vessels were at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the reasons above, to the extent the claimants’ claim are premised on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action against the Defendants and these claims should be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimants’ claims premised on s 98(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) of the Bankruptcy Act are legally unsustainable?</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I now turn to the second issue. As a starting point, it is not in dispute, as pleaded in the SOC, that Xiang Da did not receive any actual payment for the purchase price of the Vessels, and instead, Xiang Da enjoyed a set-off of its debts owed to CSC Oil and/or others pursuant to the Transactions. The Defendants argue that, on the basis of these facts, consideration had been provided for the sale of the Vessels, and the Transactions cannot be at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Section 98(3) of the Bankruptcy Act is concerned with consideration in the contractual sense (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]). Specifically, s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is concerned with the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of consideration (see <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span> at [24]). Therefore, a transaction comes within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if <span class="font-italic">no </span>contractual consideration had been provided by the grantee to the grantor. The law of contract requires that consideration be sufficient in that it must be of some value in the eyes of the law, but does not require it to be adequate in the sense of having an objective value, since it is for the contracting parties and not the court to assess the merits of their bargain (see Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) (“<span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore</span>”) at para 04.026).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is trite that consideration can exist, even if no property of the promisee had moved to the promisor in exchange for the promise. This is because valuable consideration is not restricted only to some right or interest accruing to the promisor, but it can take the form of some detriment or loss suffered by the promisee, in the case of which the promisor nevertheless obtains some corresponding benefit as a result of the detriment or loss incurred by the promisee (see generally, <span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore </span>at para 04.004). This can be illustrated with some examples. A promisee’s forbearance to sue is good consideration for a promise (see <span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore </span>at para 04.034). The extension of <span class="font-italic">credit</span> to a grantor-company by the grantee, without any transmission of property from the grantee to the grantor, also constitutes valid consideration, which our courts have considered as bringing a transaction outside of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act (see <span class="font-italic">Vesltra</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Dexia Bank NV </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 154 at [48]–[49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For the claimants to succeed in a claim based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), they must prove that Xiang Da had received <span class="font-italic">no </span>consideration from the disposal of the Vessels. The claimants’ only pleading pertaining to s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is that no sale proceeds had been paid to Xiang Da by any of the Defendants and that there had been no actual transfer of cash to Xiang Da for the Transactions (see [33] above). That the Defendants paid no sale proceeds to Xiang Da, and that there had been no actual transfer of cash to Xiang Da, do not in any way show that Xiang Da received <span class="font-italic">no </span>consideration for the Transactions. To put it another way, even if the claimants succeed in proving at trial that the Defendants paid no sale proceeds to Xiang Da and/or that Xiang Da received no actual cash payment, the claimants are not any closer to showing that the Transactions were at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. To the extent the claimants’ claims are premised on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), they are legally unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I accept that the claimants do plead in the SOC that in exchange for the disposal of the Vessels, Xiang Da received the benefit of having its debts to CSC Oil and/or others set off (see [33] above). In so far as the set-off was the <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> for the Transactions, it might be contended that this did <span class="font-italic">not</span> flow from the Defendants, from whose perspective the provision of consideration is to be assessed for they are in the position of a promisee in this context (see <span class="font-italic">Contract Law in Singapore </span>at para 04.021). The question then is whether this part of the pleading can be read as supporting the claimant’s case that <span class="font-italic">no </span>consideration had been provided for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), so that any such claim based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is <span class="font-italic">not</span> legally unsustainable. I answer this in the negative for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 First, for a claim to be struck out on the basis that it is legally unsustainable, the court must be satisfied that the pleaded facts even if proven in their entirety would not entitle the claimant to the relief sought. Thus, for me to conclude that the claimants’ case is legally unsustainable for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), I need only be satisfied that the facts as pleaded by the claimant even if proven would fail to show that contractual consideration had been <span class="font-italic">absent</span>; I do not have to be satisfied that the pleaded facts if proven would show that consideration had been provided, though that would obviously be stronger grounds for striking out. Returning to the present case, the <span class="font-italic">possibility </span>that the set-off might eventually be relied on by the claimants at trial as the <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> in supporting an argument that the set-off did not constitute good consideration because it did not flow directly from the Defendants as the grantees under the Transactions, only means that I cannot conclude that consideration had been provided on the basis of the pleaded facts assumed as proven. That, however, is not a conclusion that I have to arrive at in order to find that the claimants’ claims are legally unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Secondly, on a related note to the previous point, one might well say that the <span class="font-italic">possibility </span>of the set-off being relied on by the claimants as showing that there had been no good consideration would mean that the claimants’ claim is <span class="font-italic">not</span> legally unsustainable after all because there is still something in the SOC by way of pleaded facts that <span class="font-italic">might </span>well show that consideration was absent. However, this can only assist the claimants if, in the first place, it is reasonably apparent from the SOC that they intend to rely on this <span class="font-italic">possibility </span>in their claims based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) against the Defendants. I am not satisfied that this is the case here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Based on the SOC as it stands (see [33] above), the claimants do <span class="font-italic">not </span>rely on the set-off as part of their case that consideration had been absent. In other words, it is not the claimants’ pleaded case in the SOC that if such set-off constituted the <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo </span>for the Transactions, then it would not have been valid consideration anyway because it did not flow from the Defendants and so consideration was absent. There is also nothing in the SOC which states or even suggests that the Defendants did not suffer a corresponding detriment as a result of the benefit that Xiang Da had purportedly obtained from the set-off. Given the centrality of pleadings in delineating the parameters of a dispute (see <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [36]), based on the SOC as it stands, I am not quite sure whether the Defendants would be permitted to advance at trial a case based on the set-off not being valid consideration because it did not flow from the Defendants. All that the claimants are entitled to prove at trial, which is delineated by their pleaded case, is that consideration for Xiang Da under the Transactions had been provided by way of set-off of Xiang Da’s debts to CSC Oil. That alone, however, does not bring the claimants any closer to showing that consideration had been <span class="font-italic">absent</span> for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). I should also emphasise that the key plank of the claimants’ arguments in the present proceedings is that there had been <span class="font-italic">no </span>consideration for the sale of the Vessels because Xiang Da received no actual payment for the Transactions (see [17] above); the claimants did not argue that the set-off would not constitute valid consideration on the basis that funds for the set-off had not moved from the Defendants.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the reasons above, to the extent the claimants’ claims are premised on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, these claims are legally unsustainable and should be struck out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Before I conclude this section, let me address the claimants’ argument that no consideration had been provided for the Transactions for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) because Xiang Da’s creditors received no benefit from the Transactions since no actual payment was made to Xiang Da for the disposal of the Vessels. In my view, this argument does not assist the claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 First, the grantor and its creditors are distinct legal entities and s 98(3), quite clearly, is concerned with consideration provided to the grantor and <span class="font-italic">not</span> its creditors. Secondly, s 98(3) prohibits transactions at an undervalue, not with the objective of ensuring that any benefit provided to the grantor by the grantee in exchange for consideration provided by the grantor accrues to the benefit of all the grantor’s creditors. Instead, the objective of s 98 is to protect the creditors against a <span class="font-italic">diminution of the grantor’s assets</span> brought about by a transaction conferring an unfair or improper advantage on a particular creditor (see <span class="font-italic">Mercator</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([21] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [27]). That Xiang Da’s creditors received no direct benefit from the disposal of the Vessels is not in and of itself relevant. Further, on the claimants’ pleaded case, the objective of s 98 does not appear to have been engaged because the claimants accept that the Transactions resulted in the set-off of Xiang Da’s debts to CSC Oil and/or others, which would have served to reduce Xiang Da’s liabilities. There can accordingly be no diminution of Xiang Da’s assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimants’ claims are factually unsustainable because the Transactions were not at an undervalue? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Since the claimants’ claims against the Defendants are premised entirely on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act (see [8] above), given my conclusions above, the entirety of the claimants’ claims against the Defendants are to be struck out, and so I allow SUM 1965. The remaining two issues pertaining to the factual sustainability of the claimants’ claims therefore do not arise for consideration, but I briefly address them given the arguments that have been made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 SUM 1965 is not concerned with whether the disposal of the Vessels was in fact an undervalue transaction; that is an issue to be determined when the claims in OC 194 come to be tried on the merits, for which the legal burden falls on the claimants (see <span class="font-italic">Kon Yin Tong and another v Leow Boon Cher and others </span>[2011] SGHC 228 at [49]). The question in SUM 1965 is simply whether there is any factual basis for the claimants’ claims, and the burden is on the Defendants to demonstrate that there is none. The Defendants must satisfy the court, on the basis of the affidavit evidence adduced, that it is “clear beyond question” (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Bunga Melati 5” </span>([24] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]) that the Transactions were <span class="font-italic">not</span> at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. On the other hand, it suffices for the claimants to resist striking out by showing that they have at least an “arguable case”, even if it appeared to be weak on the merits (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Bunga Melati 5” </span>at [47]). To this end, the proof which the claimant may point to can be nothing more than his own uncorroborated and self-serving testimony as to facts within his personal knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata</span><span class="font-italic"> Lie </span>([30] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For the Defendants to show that the claimants’ claims have no factual basis, they must show either: (a) consideration <span class="font-italic">had been provided</span> by the Defendants to Xiang Da for the Transactions, so that the Transactions were not at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act; or (b) the consideration provided by the Defendants for the Transactions was <span class="font-italic">not </span>significantly less than the value of the Vessels, so that the Transactions were not at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act. In other words, to demonstrate that the claimants’ claims have no factual basis, the Defendants must point to evidence showing the very opposite of what is required to constitute a cause of action based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In connection with s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the Defendants say that consideration had been provided. The Defendants point to evidence of the running accounts between (a) CSC Oil and Xiang Da and (b) NTCS and each of the Defendants. The running accounts between NTCS and each of the Defendants record NTCS debiting from its accounts with each of the Defendants a sum corresponding to the full purchase price of each of the Vessels.

In other words, whether the running accounts conclusively show that consideration had been provided is a matter turning on whether the purported intercompany debts between CSC Oil and Xiang Da indeed exist and whether they are indeed as represented in the running accounts.

</div> I accept that the audited financial statements would be a credible source of Xiang Da’s financial information at the material time, but it does not address the claimants’ objection about the intercompany debts. The claimants, as I understand, do not dispute that the running accounts indeed record Xiang Da as owing CSC Oil certain sums of monies at various points in time. Their point is that Xiang Da is unlikely to have incurred several of these expenses in the first place and so the debts as recorded, which arise from these expenses, are not genuine. The claimants’ objections can only be answered by going behind the numbers, including the audited financial statements. I therefore accept that it is at least arguable as to whether the intercompany debts exist and on this basis the evidence does not conclusively show that consideration had been provided to render the claimants’ claims based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) factually unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In connection with s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the Defendants say that the Vessels had not been sold at an undervalue. They rely on two points in support. First, they emphasise that the court, in valuing consideration, should look at the whole of the transaction and the totality of the benefits received, and so it is significant that Xiang Da had received the benefit of having all its debts and liabilities owed to CSC Oil and other creditors discharged following the Transactions as part of the Reorganisation Plan. Secondly, valuation reports also show that the value for which the Vessels had been sold under the Agreements (net book value) were on par with if not exceeded their fair value at the time the Agreements were entered into.

The pleadings as they stand therefore do not disclose a reasonable cause of action for a claim based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). Be that as it may, assuming that the SOC was not defective as such and the claimants are entitled to mount a claim based on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and on the basis that the Vessels were disposed of at a value significantly less than their market value at the time of the Agreements, I am similarly not satisfied that it is not “clear beyond question” that the net book value of the Vessels approximated to or exceeded their market value at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Although the Defendants have adduced valuation reports that <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>are reliable and credible, the claimants have cast doubts on the methodology by which the valuation therein had been arrived at. Whether that methodology is appropriate for the circumstances of the case, and in turn whether the valuation arrived at is a fair one, are matters to be determined at the trial of the action. The questions raised by the claimants about the valuers’ methodology suffice to give rise to an <span class="font-italic">arguable </span>case that the valuation of the Vessels as recorded in the valuation reports, which largely approximate to the value under the Agreements, do not represent their fair market value at the material time.

There is no conclusive evidence before the court as to the latter (see [59] above), and so even if Xiang Da had received such benefits – which the claimants appear to question anyway as they challenge the existence of the very debts and liabilities that had been set off (see [55] above) – that alone does not contradict the factual basis of a claim premised on s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the claimants’ claims are factually unsustainable because Xiang Da had not been insolvent at the material time?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 An essential element of the cause of action which the claimants seek to pursue against the Defendants is that Xiang Da had been insolvent, in particular, at the time the Agreements were entered into (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Encus International Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v Tenacious Investment Pte Ltd and others </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1178 (“<span class="font-italic">Encus</span><span class="font-italic"> International</span>”) at [53]).

Under the cash flow test, a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; under the balance sheet test, a company is insolvent if the value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities (see <span class="font-italic">Parakou</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the Defendants to show that the claims are factually unsustainable on the basis of Xiang Da’s solvency, they need to show that Xiang Da was <span class="font-italic">not </span>insolvent at the material time on the basis of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the balance sheet and cash flow tests.

On the one hand, it is persuasive for the Defendants to contend that the carrying into effect of the Reorganisation Proposal shows that CSC Oil did not intend to call on the debts under the intercompany loans, which would have thrown a spanner into what the Reorganisation Proposal was to achieve. This would militate in favour of the liabilities under the intercompany loans being excluded from the balance sheet test. After all, the court adopts a commercial and not technical approach in determining balance sheet insolvency, and a deficiency of net assets <span class="font-italic">per se</span> is indicative but not determinative of insolvency (see <span class="font-italic">Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v </span><span class="font-italic">Phay Gi Mo and others </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Chip Thye</span>”) at [19]). On the other hand, under the terms of the Reorganisation Proposal, it was never intended that CSC Oil would write off Xiang Da’s debts <span class="font-italic">gratuitously</span>. Further, given the sequence of events contemplated under the Reorganisation Proposal (see [10] above), it appears that CSC Oil would only have proceeded with writing off Xiang Da’s debts after it received the sale proceeds of the Vessels. Indeed, based on the running accounts that the Defendants have adduced as evidence, each time CSC Oil received monies to the credit of Xiang Da, they were immediately used to set off debts owed by Xiang Da to CSC Oil. It is to some extent persuasive for the claimants to contend that CSC Oil’s course of conduct is inconsistent with it <span class="font-italic">never</span> intending to call on the debts under the intercompany loans.

</div> The court should therefore take into account the financial support from CSC Oil in determining the cash flow solvency of Xiang Da. The Defendants also emphasise that the bulk of Xiang Da’s debts at the time of the Agreements were debts under the intercompany loans, for which CSC Oil had no intention to demand repayment. These debts under the intercompany loan should therefore be excluded from the assessment of solvency under the cash flow test.

Again, there are arguments going both ways for each of these issues. On the one hand, and for the reasons mentioned earlier (at [65]), the evidence suggests that CSC did not intend to call on the debts under the intercompany loans. If that were the case, then these debts are to be ignored in determining Xiang Da’s cash flow insolvency (see <span class="font-italic">Seah</span><span class="font-italic"> Chee Wan and another v Connectus Group Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 228 at [107]). It is also not in dispute that CSC Oil had indeed, following the Transactions, paid off Xiang Da’s other trade and financial liabilities so that these liabilities were all reduced to zero in the 2017 audited financial statements,

On the other hand, as I have mentioned earlier, it is to some extent persuasive for the claimants to contend that CSC Oil’s course of conduct is inconsistent with it never intending to call on the debts under the intercompany loans.

As the parties’ arguments showed, there is no dispute that the first stage of the inquiry had been satisfied. Xiang Da is an insolvent company in liquidation.

First, I disagree with the claimants that their claims would be stifled if SFC were ordered; to the contrary, the indemnity provided by C&amp;G to the second claimant explicitly states that C&amp;G would indemnify the claimants in connection with any SFC that the court may order the claimants to furnish.

</div> Secondly, I reject the claimants’ argument that Xiang Da’s current state of affairs had been brought about by the Transactions. Based on Xiang Da’s unaudited financial statements ending 31 December 2016, prior to the Transactions, Xiang Da’s liabilities exceeded its assets. However, based on the unaudited financial statements ending 31 December 2017, these liabilities were apparently reduced to zero. The liabilities that Xiang Da is presently faced would appear to have arisen out of orders for payment of costs and disbursements made in C&amp;G’s favour in respect of Third Party Proceedings in ADM 56, which were commenced only in January 2019 (see [6] above).

</div> I do not see how it can be contended that the Transactions brought about Xiang Da’s current financial state of affairs, when the court proceedings from which these present liabilities arose were commenced significantly after the Transactions were concluded. Thirdly, the fact that C&amp;G has provided an indemnity to the second claimant does not mean that the Defendants would have recourse for their costs in OC 194. C&amp;G’s indemnity to the <span class="font-italic">second claimant</span> does not in effect give an indemnity to the Defendants; the indemnity is for the second claimant’s benefit alone (see <span class="font-italic">SW Trustees</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([74] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]). In the absence of SFC, the Defendants are limited to the claimants <span class="font-italic">alone </span>for the recovery of costs, if any. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the quantum of the SFC, the Defendants have asked for a total sum of $150,000, up to and including the trial of OC 194. The Defendants explained that they have arrived at this figure by using: (a) $70,000 for pre-trial costs (the uppermost limit of the costs range for Commercial cases in the Costs Guidelines in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (“Appendix G”)); and (b) a sum total of $80,000 for trial costs, which is arrived at using a daily tariff of $16,000 (which is also the uppermost limit of the relevant costs range in Appendix G) multiplied by five days, assuming a five-day trial.

</div> The claimants submit that using the uppermost limit of the costs range is justified because if OC 194 proceeds to trial, it is likely to involve expert witnesses pertaining to the valuation of the Vessels and/or the accounts of Xiang Da for the purposes of determining its solvency. Also, much of the evidence in OC 194, including documentary evidence and witness testimony, would have to be translated or interpreted into Chinese. The claimants did not dispute any of that or propose a different quantum for SFC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I agree with the Defendants that it would be appropriate to rely on the uppermost limit of the relevant costs range in Appendix G to quantify SFC. However, I have reservations as to whether the Defendants ought to be entitled to SFC for trial costs at this stage, where the matter appears to be quite far from being set down for trial, and there appears to be no visibility as to who are the factual or expert witnesses that both sides will call upon to testify. SFC is meant to protect a defendant’s costs exposure brought upon by litigation by an impecunious claimant. A defendant can only be expected to apply for SFC for a particular stage of the proceedings when it comes to possess the relevant information on which it may determine its likely costs exposure for that stage of the proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">SW Trustees</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([74] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [64]). On this basis, it is difficult to see why the Defendants should be entitled to SFC for a stage of the proceedings, in connection with which the parties presently appear to have no information on. I accept that SFC applications under the ROC 2021 are to be made as part of the single application pending trial (“SAPT”) (see O 9 r 9(4) of the ROC 2021), but surely it could not have been an intended consequence of the SAPT that a defendant can now be entitled to SFC for a part of the court proceedings for which there is no material or information that can enable the defendant to ascertain its likely costs exposure or for the claimant to assess if the quantum of SFC requested for by the defendant is justified. Also, notwithstanding the SAPT, the court has the power to allow a defendant to apply for SFC even after the SAPT, if new information subsequently emerges as to enable the defendant to better quantify the SFC it needs with respect to later stages of the proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">SW Trustees </span>at [65]). Therefore, if the issue had arisen for decision, I would have limited the SFC to which the claimants are entitled to the pre-trial stage which, adopting the claimants’ quantification, is fixed at $70,000. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the above reasons, I allow SUM 1965 and I order that the claimants’ claims in OC 194 be struck out in their entirety pursuant to O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021, as these claims are premised on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act which, in my view, respectively disclose no reasonable cause of action and are legally unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I will hear the parties on the consequential orders to be made in respect of SUM 1967 as well as the costs of these summonses separately. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 At the hearing where I delivered this judgment to the parties, the claimants’ counsel pointed out that there were <span class="font-italic">also </span>claims against Zhang and Wu for breach of fiduciary and/or statutory duties (see [8] above) by virtue of them having procured Xiang Da’s entry into the Transactions <span class="font-italic">alone</span>, irrespective of whether the Transactions had been at an undervalue within s 98(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, and the claimants’ claims for knowing receipt and/or dishonest assistance against the Defendants were in part also based on those breaches. An issue was therefore raised as to whether my decision in SUM 1965, which proceeded on the basis that the claimants’ claims against the Defendants were premised entirely on the Transactions being at an undervalue within s 98(3) of the Bankruptcy Act (see [50] above), would not have dealt with those claims for knowing receipt and/or dishonest assistance identified by counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I did not consider this to be an issue. Let me explain why so by reference to the SOC itself. Paragraphs 11 to 13 of the SOC describe the Transactions, the manner in which they were carried out, and that Xiang Da had been insolvent at the time of the Transactions or became insolvent as a result of the Transactions. Paragraph 14 of the SOC goes on to plead that the Transactions were, for the reasons I have alluded to earlier in reciting the claimants’ case (see [4] above), at an undervalue. Paragraphs 15 to 18 set out the various duties owed by Zhang and Wu as directors and/or trustees of Xiang Da’s assets and also that Zhang and Wu owed duties to Xiang Da’s creditors given Xiang Da’s insolvency or parlous financial state at the time of the Transactions. Paragraph 19 of the SOC then states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In breach of their abovestated fiduciary and/or statutory duties and/or their duties as trustees, Zhang and/or Wu carried out or caused to have been carried out <span class="font-italic">the Transactions above without any sale proceeds having been paid to Xiang Da </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">and</span><span class="font-italic">, as stated in paragraphs 14(a) and 14(b) above, the Transactions were carried out at an undervalue</span>. As a result, Xiang Da suffered loss and damage.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and underline] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The remainder of the SOC sets out the claims for knowing receipt and/or dishonest assistance against the Defendants, as well as the claims for fraudulent trading against Zhang and Wu, and finally, the reliefs sought by the claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The claimants’ counsel emphasised that the part of para 19 of the SOC which I have italicised above and specifically the word “and” showed the disjunction between <span class="font-italic">the Transactions</span> and <span class="font-italic">the Transactions having been carried out at an undervalue</span>. I accept this, in so far as it is a description of the words contained in para 19 of the SOC. However, no material facts whatsoever have been pleaded by the claimants as to how Xiang Da’s entry into the Transactions <span class="font-italic">alone </span>gave rise to a breach of fiduciary and/or statutory duties by Zhang and/or Wu. In the absence of such pleaded facts, obviously the SOC could <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been read as containing claims against Zhang and/or Wu for breach of fiduciary and/or statutory duties, mounted on the basis of them having procured Xiang Da’s entry into the Transactions <span class="font-italic">alone </span>independently of whether the Transactions were at an undervalue. Be that as it may, if I were wrong in my reading of the SOC, the absence of such material facts would mean that even if any such claims existed, the SOC discloses no reasonable cause of action, and they are liable to be struck out pursuant to O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC 2021 in any event. Finally, I should also add, as the parties’ submissions and their respective positions in SUM 1965 clearly show (see [15]–[19] above), this characterisation of the claimants’ claim is not that which had been relied on by the claimants for the purposes of SUM 1965.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Perry Peh<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anthony Soh (Alcove Law LLC) for the claimants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Una Khng, Huang Peide and Iris Ng (Helmsman LLC) for the third to fifth defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
