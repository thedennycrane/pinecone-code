<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       AYM (“the Husband”) and AYL
                    (“the Wife”) were married for more than 20 years when the Wife
                    filed for divorce on 8 April 2010. They have three children, J, N, and L
                    (henceforth collectively referred as “the Children”). As part of
                    the divorce proceedings, the parties reached an agreement on the ancillary
                    matters regarding custody, care and control, maintenance, and the division of
                    matrimonial assets. They recorded the terms of their agreement in a consent
                    order as part of the interim judgment entered on 13 July 2010 (“the
                    Consent Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Consent Order provided, among other things,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Husband was to pay:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       $2,670 per month as
                            maintenance for each of the Children;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the Children’s school fees
                            (which at that time amounted in aggregate to about $7,000 per month);
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       $3,990 per month as maintenance for the Wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     a piece of landed property (“the
                        Matrimonial Property”) was to be sold within six years and the
                        proceeds would be divided in the proportions of 80% to the Wife and 20% to
                        the Husband if the sale price was equal to or less than $2.5m, or 70% to the
                        Wife and 30% to the Husband should the sale price be more than $2.5m;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     a list of
                        other cash assets amounting to about $900,000 would be divided between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appeals before us arise from the decision in
                        <em>AYL v AYM</em> [2013] SGHC 237 (“the
                    GD”) concerning the variation of the terms of the Consent Order providing
                    for maintenance payments by the Husband to both the Wife and the
                    Children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 10 July 2014, we heard oral submissions from
                    the parties and adjourned the matter for the parties to furnish us with
                    information regarding the amount of maintenance that had been already paid by
                    the Husband since the Consent Order was entered into. Having received the
                    information requested, we now deliver our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts and background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The dispute between the parties has resulted in
                    substantial litigation in both the State Courts and the Supreme Court, and has
                    already come up before the Court of Appeal on one previous occasion. The facts
                    of the case have been set out in detail in a number of decisions (see <em>AYL v AYM</em> [2012] SGHC 64, <em>AYM v
                        AYL</em> [2013] 1 SLR 924, and the GD), and it is unnecessary to
                    canvass them again at length. For present purposes, we set out only the facts
                    that are material to our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We begin with the Husband’s financial
                    situation at the time the Consent Order was entered into. The Husband was made
                    redundant at work in or about 2007. He then decided to enter into a business
                    venture with another partner. Together, they incorporated a company which was in
                    the business of providing solutions for the felling, renewal and processing of
                    rubber wood in Indonesia. The Husband’s evidence is that he and his
                    partner each invested $1m in the company while also seeking funding from
                    external investors. The company, however, was never profitable. Despite that,
                    the Husband was paid a substantial monthly salary of $22,438 by the company from
                    September 2009 onwards. As mentioned above, the terms of the Consent Order were
                    recorded on 13 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Less than a year later, on 14 June 2011, the
                    Husband brought an application to vary the terms of the Consent Order in
                    relation to the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance for the Wife
                    and the Children on the ground that there had been a material change in the
                    circumstances due to the failure of the company. The District Judge ordered that
                    the Consent Order be varied but not quite in the way the Husband had wanted. The
                    District Judge ordered that the Matrimonial Property be sold within six months
                    and also made provisions for some minor variation to the maintenance of one of
                    the Children, JLR. The Husband appealed to the High Court, and later to the
                    Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal decided the appeal in relation to varying
                    that part of the Consent Order concerning the division of matrimonial assets but
                    remitted the issue of varying the Consent Order in relation to maintenance back
                    to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the meantime, three significant events took
                    place. First, the Matrimonial Property was sold for $5.1m, which was a much
                    higher price than what the parties had contemplated (even on their most
                    optimistic calculations). Secondly, the Wife brought an application for the
                    order for periodic maintenance payments to be converted to a lump sum payment.
                    Thirdly, the Wife and the Children relocated to Sydney, Australia in January
                    2012, while the Husband remarried a Singaporean lady and currently lives in
                    Singapore with her and her two children from her previous
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As directed by the Court of Appeal, all issues
                    relating to maintenance were heard by the Judge (by which time the events
                    described in the preceding paragraph had already transpired). Before the Judge,
                    the Husband sought to reduce the amount of periodic maintenance payable under
                    the Consent Order by arguing that there were two material changes in the
                    circumstances: (1) that there had been a change in his financial circumstances
                    due to the failure of his business venture; and (2) that the parties had
                    obtained an unexpected windfall from the sale of the Matrimonial Property. The
                    Wife, on the other hand, sought to vary the Consent Order by converting the
                    periodic maintenance payments into a lump sum. In her application, the Wife
                    initially sought $750,000 for herself and $1.845m for the children but was
                    eventually willing to accept a reduced amount of $250,000 for herself and
                    $750,000 for the Children. Although there was no specific evidence on this, we
                    deduced that these sums were arrived at having regard to payments already made
                    by the Husband by this time. The Wife did not take any position on the
                    Husband’s contention that the windfall gain from the sale of the
                    Matrimonial Property should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Judge held that a lump sum payment was
                    appropriate, and the quantum of maintenance sought by the Wife was reasonable in
                    light of the original amount of maintenance payments that were to be made under
                    the Consent Order. He also specifically found that neither of the two changes of
                    circumstances relied on by the Husband were made out or warranted any
                    adjustment. The Judge therefore ordered on 12 August 2013 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Husband pay a lump sum
                        maintenance to the Wife fixed at $250,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Husband pay lump sum maintenance for the
                        children, fixed at $750,000 (inclusive of school fees).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Husband was dissatisfied with the orders
                    made. On appeal, he again asserted that the two material changes in
                    circumstances set out at [9] above warranted a reduction in the maintenance
                    payable under the Consent Order; he also argued that he would be financially
                    crippled if compelled to make lump sum maintenance payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Wife maintained that the Judge’s
                    decision to refuse a downward variation of maintenance was correct because there
                    had in fact been no material changes in the relevant circumstances. She also
                    contended that the Judge was correct to order an aggregate lump sum maintenance
                    payment of $1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Variation of consent orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As a preliminary point, we note that an aspect
                    of this case concerned the principles relating to when the terms of a consent
                    order may be varied in the matrimonial context. Sections 118 and 119 of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) provide for the variation of
                    maintenance orders and agreements for maintenance for the wife
                    respectively:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Power of court to vary orders for
                            maintenance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>118.</b> The court may at any time vary or
                        rescind any subsisting order for maintenance… on the application of
                        the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was
                        made… where it is satisfied that the order was based on any
                        misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material
                        change in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Power of court to vary agreements
                            for maintenance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>119.</b> Subject to section 116, the court may
                        at any time and from time to time vary the terms of any agreement as to
                        maintenance made between husband and wife… where it is satisfied that
                        there has been any material change in the circumstances and notwithstanding
                        any provision to the contrary in any such agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thus, the court may vary agreements for
                    maintenance where it is satisfied that there has been a material change in the
                    circumstances. The circumstances in question must be those prevailing at the
                    time the agreement for maintenance was entered into. The material changes, which
                    any party seeking to vary an agreement for maintenance must show, therefore
                    relate to those circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In relation to variation of maintenance for
                    children, the relevant provisions are in ss 72 and 73:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Rescission and variation of
                            order</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>72.</b>—(1) On the application of any
                        person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and
                        on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, his wife or child,
                        or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the
                        court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it
                        thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred
                        upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any
                        application made under this section, take into consideration any change in
                        the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the
                        making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Power of court to vary agreement
                            for maintenance of child</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>73.</b> The court may, at any time and from time
                        to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a
                        child… notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that
                        agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare
                        of the child to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Although the parties did not cite these provisions in their
                        respective cases or submissions before us, we thought that we should make
                        clear the basis for varying the maintenance of the Children if that is what
                        we are minded to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Section 73 provides that any agreement
                    relating to maintenance may be varied where the court is “satisfied that
                    it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”. The parties
                    did not address us at all on this requirement under s 73. But in our judgment,
                    the provision is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances
                    of the parents as <em>a</em> basis for varying the
                    maintenance for the child. Whether or not this should result in the maintenance
                    actually being varied is of course a factual inquiry that depends on the
                    circumstances of each case. In the present appeals before us, the parties
                    addressed us solely on whether there were material changes in the circumstances.
                    Nonetheless we also considered the provisions of s 73.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Turning to the substance of the appeals, there
                    are two issues before us:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Should the payment of maintenance be
                        effected in a lump sum payment instead of through periodic
                    payments?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Should
                        the quantum of maintenance be varied, and if so, what should this variation
                        be?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the mode of maintenance be a lump sum payment?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The following principles concerning lump sum
                    maintenance payments may be extracted from the case law:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     A lump sum payment allows for a
                        clean break in the marriage and should be availed of whenever feasible
                            (<em>Lee Puey Hwa v Tay Cheow Seng</em> [1991] 2
                        SLR(R) 196 (“<em>Lee Puey Hwa</em>”) at
                        [9]). Such a clean break may help avoid further litigation and acrimony
                        between the parties (<em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and
                            another appeal and another matter</em> [2012] 4 SLR 405
                            (“<em>Wan Lai Cheng</em>”) at
                        [88]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     A lump
                        sum payment should not be ordered if it would cripple the husband
                        financially (<em>Lee Puey Hwa</em> at [9]; and
                            <em>Neo Mei Lan Helena v Long Melvin Anthony</em>
                        [2002] 2 SLR(R) 616 (“<em>Neo Mei Lan
                            Helena</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     A lump sum payment is appropriate where there is reason
                        to believe that defaults in payments may be likely (<em>Neo
                            Mei Lan Helena</em>; and <em>BCS v BCT</em>
                        [2012] SGDC 338).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is a clean break desirable?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In most cases, as between the former spouses,
                    a clean break would be desirable as suggested in <em>Lee Puey
                        Hwa</em>. It is clear from the extent of the litigation in the present
                    case that there remains much acrimony between the parties and a clean break
                    would be desirable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is also clear that both parties have since
                    moved on with their lives. As already mentioned, the Wife and the Children have
                    relocated to Australia, and the Husband has since remarried and now has
                    step-children to care for. A lump sum payment is plainly called for in these
                    circumstances to enable both parties to be able to move on with their lives and
                    avoid further rancorous interactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     A lump sum order is most likely to prevent any
                    further legal disputes between the parties; an especially relevant concern in
                    this context given the multiplicity of legal proceedings this dispute has
                    generated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would a lump sum payment cripple the Husband financially?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In order to determine whether the Husband
                    would be financially crippled by a lump sum payment, we first have to ascertain
                    what this sum might be. Given our finding that a clean break is desirable in the
                    circumstances, we proceed to quantify what a lump sum payment of maintenance
                    would be in this case before returning to this question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the quantum of maintenance be varied?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there a material change in the circumstances?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The failure of business venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The cases have established that a material
                    adverse change in the financial circumstances of the Husband, especially where
                    the Wife is reasonably provided for, is a good basis for a downward variation of
                    a maintenance order. This also applies to agreements for maintenance. In
                        <em>Chua Chwee Thiam v Lim Annie</em> [1989] 1 SLR(R)
                    426, the husband was able to show that his previously strong financial status
                    had deteriorated drastically: his company was placed in receivership, his credit
                    cards were cancelled and he was unable to pay his income tax. On the other hand,
                    the wife was well-off, owning two properties in prime locations and a luxury
                    car. On that basis, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was), varied the agreement as
                    to maintenance that the parties had previously entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Husband’s argument is that at the
                    time of the Consent Order, he was in a good financial position as the company he
                    incorporated had just secured fresh investment funding of US$1.2m from a
                    Jersey-based fund. He was drawing a monthly salary of $22,438 and the business
                    prospects looked promising. It was on that basis that he agreed to provide the
                    maintenance of $3,990 per month to the Wife and a sum of about $15,000 per month
                    for the Children (including school fees). This was on top of him agreeing to
                    divide the matrimonial assets in a manner which would give the Wife a generous
                    share of the assets. The business, however, did not take off. This resulted in a
                    withdrawal of the external funding and the Husband eventually resigned from the
                    company in March 2012. This, said the husband, caused his financial
                    circumstances to take a drastic turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Wife on the other hand argued that by the
                    time the parties were negotiating the Consent Order between January and May
                    2010, the business was already not doing well, and the Husband in fact already
                    knew that it was likely to fail. Even if it might be something of an
                    overstatement to say that the Husband <em>knew</em> the
                    business was going to fail, the Wife’s argument, more fairly put, was that
                    the Husband could not have been relying on any sustainable future income from
                    the company in order to meet his maintenance obligations. Although the Husband
                    was drawing a substantial monthly salary from the company, it had recorded
                    losses in each financial year, and did not own any substantial assets. The
                    Husband was effectively paying himself through his initial capital investment in
                    the company. The Wife also noted that by coming to an agreement on these terms,
                    neither party was required to disclose its assets. It is not disputed that the
                    Husband had other assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our judgment, the Husband’s version
                    of the events was difficult to accept. The Husband alleged that he agreed to the
                    terms in the Consent Order entered into in July 2010 because the Company had
                    secured the Jersey-based funding in June 2010. However, as pointed out by the
                    Wife, the documentary evidence shows that parties had agreed to the proposed
                    terms in the Consent Order as early as May 2010. The documentary evidence also
                    shows that the Husband had raised concerns at various points in 2010 and that by
                    October 2010, less than three months after the date of the Consent Order, he was
                    claiming that he was in a precarious financial position. These facts lead us to
                    conclude that the Husband could not reasonably have been relying on the success
                    of the Company at the time of the Consent Order. He was well aware of the risks
                    he was facing. But those were the circumstances in which he agreed to the
                    Consent Order. We do not wish to speculate on the Husband’s reasons for
                    taking the stance that he did, but it is clear to us that in these
                    circumstances, the failure of the Company could not constitute a material change
                    in the circumstances. We therefore agree in substance with the Judge’s
                    conclusion on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The higher sale proceeds received from the Matrimonial
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We now consider the second change of
                    circumstance relied on by the Husband. As mentioned above, it is not disputed
                    that the sale of the Matrimonial Property at $5.1m was at a much higher price
                    than what the parties had envisaged even on the most optimistic basis. This was
                    clear from the correspondence between the parties when negotiating the Consent
                    Order, where the parties estimated that the highest price the Matrimonial
                    Property could fetch would be $3.75m. Using this as the outer limit, the parties
                    therefore obtained an entirely unforeseen and unexpected windfall of
                    $1.35m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As we have mentioned above, the Consent Order
                    provided that the Wife would get 70% and the Husband would get 30% of the
                    proceeds of sale if the sale price of the matrimonial property exceeded $2.5m.
                    As it stands, the Wife has received 70% of the $1.35m windfall which neither
                    party had expected at the time when they agreed on the terms of the Consent
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     When the terms of the Consent Order (including
                    those in relation to maintenance) were agreed upon, this was done with certain
                    expectations of what the Wife would be getting from the division of the
                    matrimonial assets. We agree with the Husband that the reality, which departed
                    considerably from those expectations, constituted a material change in the
                    circumstances. As matters transpired, the Wife has in fact received a larger
                    amount than what was initially expected from the division of the matrimonial
                    assets. In our judgment, this would justify a reduction in the agreed quantum of
                    maintenance since the Wife would be in a better position to provide for herself
                    and the Children as a result of this windfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As to the extent of the downward variation, we
                    find that an appropriate figure would be $270,000. We arrive at this figure on
                    the following basis:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife received $945,000 out of
                        the windfall of $1.35m while the Husband received
                    $405,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Wife
                        therefore received $540,000 more than the Husband in terms of additional
                        assets beyond what the parties had contemplated at the time of agreeing the
                        maintenance arrangements in the Consent Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     In our judgment, half of this $540,000
                            (<em>ie</em>, $270,000) should be deducted from any
                        lump sum order made as a fair adjustment to take proper account of this
                        change of circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Variation of the quantum of maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Having decided that a clean break was
                    desirable, and that the deduction of $270,000 from any lump sum order would
                    reflect a fair adjustment to address the change in the circumstances, we now
                    proceed to ascertain the amount of lump sum payment for
                maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Calculation based on converting the periodic payment provided for in
                the Consent Order into a lump sum payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At the outset, it may be noted that the
                    Husband’s appeals are against the orders made by the Judge and those
                    orders were for a lump sum of $250,000 in favour of the Wife and $750,000 in
                    favour of the Children. This was in essence an acceptance of the position that
                    the Wife had put forward and it is therefore unsurprising that the Wife has not
                    appealed those orders. These lump sum orders are logically the point at which
                    our analysis should begin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the course of the arguments, however, the
                    Husband made reference to the fact that he had already made substantial payments
                    since the date of the Consent Order and there was a suggestion that these
                    payments should, <em>in addition to</em> any other
                    adjustment we might make, be offset against the lump sum of $1m ordered by the
                    Judge. We disagree. In our view, it is only fair to proceed on the basis that
                    when the Wife proposed the aggregate lump sum order of $1m, this <em>already</em> took into account all the payments made by the
                    Husband until then. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We begin by examining the terms of the Consent
                    Order. In relation to the Wife, she was entitled to a sum of at least $3,990 per
                    month under the Consent Order. Using a multiplier of 26 years based on the
                    Wife’s submissions, in reliance on the formula used by this Court in
                        <em>Wan Lai Cheng</em>, this yields a sum of
                    $1,244,880. Subjecting this to a 20% discount to take account of the fact that
                    the payment is being made upfront in a lump sum would reduce this to $995,904.
                    This was also the figure arrived at by the Judge. In addition, the parties agree
                    that the Husband has already paid maintenance for the Wife amounting to
                    $100,264.83. This leaves a balance of approximately $895,640 yet to be
                    paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for the Children, we consider the amounts
                    payable for maintenance and school fees separately. We should state that the
                    calculations we have used are approximate but it does not matter because we have
                    undertaken this exercise only to determine whether, and if so, to what extent,
                    the Husband’s contributions are to be offset against any order for lump
                    sum payment that we might make.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On that basis, we base our calculations on the
                    following premises which were contained in the Consent Order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     That maintenance is payable for J at
                        $2,670 per month until she commences her university education and then
                        $1,350 per month for the next four years (which is the time within which she
                        is expected to finish her undergraduate degree).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     That maintenance is payable for both N
                        and L at $2,670 per month until they are both 21.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     At the time of the Consent Order in July 2010,
                    J, was 16 years and 11 months old. Assuming that she started university in
                    January 2012, the lump sum payable for her maintenance would amount to $112,860.
                    N was 10 years and 2 months old, and the lump sum maintenance for her would have
                    amounted to $347,100. L was 7 years and 6 months old, and the lump sum
                    maintenance for him would have amounted to $432,540. This amounts in total to
                    $892,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For school fees, we base our calculations on
                    the following premises:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Children all attend high
                        school at private schools until they graduate at the age of
                    19.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     J’s four
                        year undergraduate degree will be the only tertiary education for the
                        Children which the Husband will pay for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     The costs of the schools fees are taken from the
                        agreed table of payments made by the Husband to the Wife. This indicates
                        that J’s school fees were $2,500 per month for high school, and
                        N’s and L’s school fees are $2,250 per month each for high
                        school.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     J’s university fees are approximately $30,000 per
                year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At the time of the Consent Order, J still had
                    two years of high school left and four more years in university, and her school
                    fees in total would therefore amount to $180,000. For N, she still had about
                    eight years of high school left, and the amount of school fees payable would be
                    $216,000. For L, he still had about 11 years of high school left, and the amount
                    of school fees payable would be $297,000. The total amount of school fees
                    payable would be approximately $693,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The sum of the maintenance and school fees
                    that would be payable on the foregoing basis, for the Children is, $1,585,500.
                    We apply a discount of 15% to this on account of payment being by a lump sum and
                    accordingly, this amount is reduced to $1,347,675. We have used a 15% discount
                    (as compared to the 20% discount used for the Wife’s maintenance) because
                    the advancement of the time for payment in the case of the Children is less than
                    in the case of the Wife since the periodic payments would have been payable for
                    a longer duration in the latter case. The Husband has already paid $463,265.38
                    towards the Children’s maintenance and education. This therefore leaves a
                    balance of $884,410 yet to be paid on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The sum of the amounts that would have
                    remained payable if the periodic payments due under the Consent Order had been
                    converted to a lump sum order would have been in the region of $1,780,050. This
                    would have taken account of all the payments that had been made by the Husband
                    up to the time of the Judge’s order in 12 August 2013 (see [10] above).
                    Allowing a further deduction of $270,000 on account of the adjustment that we
                    consider should be made by reason of the change of circumstances and a further
                    sum of $40,000 which was the sum of maintenance paid by the Husband for the Wife
                    and the Children <em>after</em> the 12 August 2013 order
                    was made, the amount of maintenance payable as a lump sum on this basis would
                    have been around $1,470,050. Thus, it is plain that starting our analysis with
                    the lump sum order of $1m already puts the Husband in a better position than he
                    would have been in otherwise, even having regard to all the sums he had paid. It
                    would therefore be wrong to make a further deduction on account of the payments
                    he had made prior to 12 August 2013 and we proceed accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Variation of the maintenance based on adjusting the position taken by
                the Wife before the Judge </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We accordingly return to the orders made by
                    the Judge on 12 August 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is evident that the Judge did not take into
                    account the adjustment of $270,000 that we consider should have been allowed.
                    The Wife’s submission before the Judge acknowledged that the parties
                    received a windfall from the sale of the Matrimonial Property. However, as
                    stated earlier, she never once mentioned that her receiving a higher proportion
                    of the sale proceeds was something material to be taken into consideration in
                    deciding on the quantum of maintenance. In other words, she did not take the
                    additional windfall of $270,000 into account in seeking the aggregate lump sum
                    maintenance amount of $1m. The Judge in essence also did not consider this
                    windfall and held (at [8] of the GD) that “the increase in value of the
                    Property improved not only the [Wife’s] but also the [Husband’s]
                    financial situation, in that his 30% share of the proceeds is by reason of that
                    increase likewise larger than originally anticipated”, and therefore did
                    not think that the higher sale price “called for a significant reduction
                    in the amount of maintenance”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, for the reasons we have already
                    explained, we consider that this was a material change in the circumstances.
                    Also for the reason we have given, the fact that the Husband also got a share of
                    that windfall (albeit a significantly smaller one) does not address or affect
                    the need to take account of the additional resources that the Wife had over and
                    above what had been contemplated at the time of the Consent Order. We therefore
                    hold that any lump sum order should be reduced by this amount to take account of
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We add that reducing the amount of maintenance
                    in this way is not in any way contrary to the welfare of the Children. The
                    reduction is made having regard to the resources available to the Wife to
                    provide for herself and the Children (as explained above at [29]). Moreover, we
                    are satisfied that it is in the interests of the Children’s welfare that
                    there be a lump sum order for maintenance since this would, as we have observed,
                    help reduce the occasion for acrimony between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We further consider that the sum of $40,000
                    that has been paid by the Husband <em>after</em> the 12
                    August 2013 by way of interim maintenance should also be deducted from the lump
                    sum amount. This leaves a balance of $690,000 which we hold should be the lump
                    sum payable by the Husband. We further hold that this sum should be apportioned
                    as $100,000 in respect of the payments due to the Wife and $590,000 in respect
                    of the payments due to the Children.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Finally, we return to the issue of whether a
                    lump sum payment would cripple the Husband financially. In our judgment, an
                    order requiring payment of the sum of $690,000 would not do so. It is the
                    Husband’s own affidavit evidence that he has $985,323.87 left from his
                    share of the sale proceeds from the Matrimonial Property. The Husband later
                    asserted in his submissions before the Judge that he only has $800,000 left, but
                    even if we accept that to be the case, that is still a sufficient sum of money
                    for him to make the lump sum payment without crippling him financially. This is
                    aside from the other assets that he owns. Insofar as the Husband contends that
                    he has undertaken fresh obligations to his new family, we do not consider that
                    this should affect or compromise the pre-existing obligations he continues to
                    owe to the Wife and his children from his previous marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the foregoing reasons, we allow the
                    appeals in part and order that the Judge’s order for maintenance be
                    reduced so that the Husband is to pay a lump sum of $690,000 to the Wife being a
                    sum of $100,000 by way of lump sum maintenance for her and a sum of $590,000 by
                    way of lump sum maintenance for the Children inclusive of their school
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We make no order as to costs. The usual
                    consequential orders will apply.</p>
