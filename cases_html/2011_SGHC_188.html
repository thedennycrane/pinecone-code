<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs Ma Ong Kee and Tan Soo Ling
                    (collectively referred to as “The Purchasers”) had entered into an
                    agreement to purchase a non-residential property known as 15, Realty Centre
                    #01-02, Enggor Street, Singapore 079716 (“the Property”) from the
                    defendant Kaiyo Reptile Products Private Limited (“the Vendor”).
                    The sole dispute which arose between them was whether the Purchasers were liable
                    to pay goods and services tax (“GST”) on the purchase price which
                    the Vendor was itself liable to pay to the relevant authority. Unfortunately,
                    this issue was not resolved and the Vendor terminated the agreement in the
                    circumstances elaborated below and forfeited the deposit paid by the Purchasers.
                    The Purchasers then filed a Writ of Summons to claim specific performance of the
                    agreement and liquidated damages or general damages in lieu of specific
                    performance. The Vendor in turn counterclaimed declarations that it was entitled
                    to rescind the agreement, that the Purchasers were to cancel any entry in the
                    relevant land register relating to the agreement and that the Vendor was
                    entitled to forfeit all moneys paid by the Purchasers. The Vendor also
                    counterclaimed a declaration that it was entitled to damages under
                    condition 29.9 of the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1999
                    (“the 1999 Conditions of Sale”) but did not pursue this claim
                    before me. Instead, the Vendor claimed damages for being precluded from
                    utilising a deposit as I shall elaborate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By an option to purchase dated 31 March
                    2010, the Vendor granted the Purchasers an option to purchase the Property at a
                    price of $3,800,000. The option fee was $38,000, <em>ie</em>, one per cent of the price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 14 April 2010, the Purchasers’
                    solicitors Colin Ng &amp; Partners LLP (“CNP”) wrote to the
                    Vendor’s solicitors Lee Bon Leong &amp; Co (“LBLC”), with
                    various documents enclosed to exercise the option. One of the documents was a
                    cheque for $152,000 in favour of LBLC, being the balance of 5% of the price,
                    which was the amount payable on the exercise of the option. I will refer to the
                    entire 5% amounting to $190,000 as “the Deposit”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 15 April 2010, LBLC wrote to CNP to
                    state, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Property was sold subject to an
                    existing tenancy and that the Vendor was registered for GST. LBLC requested
                    $13,300 being the 7% GST payable on the Deposit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Notwithstanding the request for $13,300, there
                    was no dispute that the option had been validly exercised. Accordingly when it
                    was exercised, there was a binding sale and purchase agreement between the
                    Vendor and the Purchasers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Although the terms of the option did not clarify
                    whether the Property was sold with vacant possession or subject to a tenancy,
                    the Purchasers did not raise any issue about the tenancy and apparently accepted
                    that the sale was subject to the tenancy mentioned by LBLC in its letter dated
                    15 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 11 May 2010, about four weeks after
                    LBLC’s letter of 15 April 2010, CNP wrote to LBLC to say that the
                    Purchasers were surprised at the belated request for payment of GST and that the
                    Purchasers were not obliged to pay it “as this is contrary to the
                    contractual bargain between the parties. In any event, this is consistent with
                    the position at law where if there is no provision in the Option for the
                    purchaser to pay the vendor’s GST liability or the GST attracted by the
                    sale, then the price quoted by the vendor for the sale of the property shall be
                    deemed to include any GST chargeable on the sale”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       LBLC replied on 12 May 2010 to disagree
                    with CNP’s letter on the issue as to whether the Purchasers were liable to
                    pay the Vendor’s GST, pending formal instructions from the Vendor. LBLC
                    drew CNP’s attention to condition 7.3 of The 1999 Conditions of Sale
                    which they said imposed the liability for GST on the Purchasers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 14 May 2010, LBLC wrote to confirm their
                    client’s stand as stated in LBLC’s letter of 12 May 2010. I
                    will refer to the issue as to whether the Purchasers were liable to pay the GST
                    as “the GST issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The parties could not agree on the GST issue.
                    Apparently, the Purchasers offered to complete the sale but to pay the 7% GST
                    amounting to $266,000 to CNP or to a neutral third party to be held as
                    stakeholders pending determination of the GST issue. However, these suggestions
                    were not acceptable to the Vendor. Accordingly, the sale and purchase was not
                    completed on 28 July 2010 which was the scheduled date of completion as
                    calculated under the terms of the option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 30 July 2010, LBLC sent CNP a 21-day
                    notice to complete the sale and purchase. In turn, CNP sent LBLC a 21-day notice
                    to complete also dated 30 July 2010. Both the 21-day notices expired on
                    20 August 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     While each set of solicitors maintained that
                    their respective clients were ready, able and willing to complete the
                    transaction, there was no completion because of the GST issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the circumstances, if the notice to
                    complete from LBLC was valid, the Vendor was entitled to forfeit and keep the
                    deposit paid by the Purchasers and resell the Property (see condition 29.8
                    of the 1999 Conditions of Sale). Although there is no express provision that a
                    sale and purchase agreement would be terminated for failure by a purchaser to
                    comply with a valid notice to complete, both sides assumed that that must be the
                    effect of condition 29.8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Purchasers filed the writ of summons on
                    24 August 2010, a few days after the expiry of the notices to complete. The
                    reliefs they sought and the reliefs sought by the Vendor in its counterclaim are
                    summarised in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The action was fixed for hearing for three
                    days from 4 July 2011. Counsel for the parties eventually agreed that the
                    material facts were not in dispute. The issue was the correct interpretation of
                    condition 7.3.1 of the 1999 Conditions of Sale, <em>ie</em>, whether it imposed liability for GST on the Purchasers.
                    Counsel summarised the facts in an Agreed Statement of Facts which is attached
                    hereto as a schedule. I have elaborated above on the summary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Condition 7.3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Condition 7.3 of the 1999 Conditions of Sale
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.3.1 The Purchaser (whether of freehold or leasehold
                            property) shall pay all Goods and Services Tax, if any, which may be
                            payable in respect of the sale price of the property under the Goods and
                            Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A) on completion or earlier as required by the
                            Comptroller.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.3.2 These provisions are not to merge in the
                            Conveyance of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The predecessor to the 1999 Conditions of Sale
                    is the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1994 (“the 1994
                    Conditions of Sale”). It was common ground that condition 7.3.1 of
                    the 1999 Conditions of Sale is a new provision dealing with GST and that there
                    was no such provision in the 1994 Conditions of Sale on GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     GST was introduced in Singapore from
                    1 April 1994 under the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 1994 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 8(3) of the Act stipulates that tax on
                    any supply of goods or services is a liability of the person making the supply.
                    However, this only made the supplier liable to the relevant authority for GST.
                    It did not preclude the supplier from recovering the GST (for which it was
                    liable) from the consumer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Regulation 77(1) of the Goods and Services Tax
                    (General) Regulations states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.–(1)    Where any taxable person displays,
                            advertises, publishes or quotes in any manner the price of any supply of
                            goods or services he makes or intends to make, such price shall include
                            the tax that is chargeable on the supply under the Act unless the
                            Comptroller approves otherwise under regulation 78.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel for the Purchasers submitted that
                    since the price quoted by the Vendor was $3.8 million, that was inclusive of GST
                    and they should not be liable for GST on the $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I was uncertain whether Reg 77(1) was
                    confined to a quotation to the public at large or it also applied to the facts
                    in the present case. Admittedly, the words “quotes in any manner”
                    were wide enough to cover the present case. However, even if they did apply, it
                    seemed to me that Reg 77(1) did not preclude a supplier from claiming GST on the
                    purchase price from the consumer. For example, if the terms of the option
                    stipulated the purchase price to be $3.8m and if there was a specific provision
                    in the option clearly stating that the Purchasers were to pay the GST on the
                    purchase price, then the Purchasers would be liable to pay the GST on the $3.8
                    million, even if the Vendor had simply orally quoted the $3.8 million figure,
                    without more, before the option was issued. Counsel for the Purchasers accepted
                    this as much. Therefore, the question still remained whether condition 7.3.1
                    imposed the liability for GST on the Purchasers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     True, condition 7.3.1 was not well
                    drafted. It did not impose liability for GST on the Purchasers as clearly as the
                    contractual provision in <em>Woon Wee Hao v Coastland Realty Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 463 (“<em>Woon Wee
                        Hao</em>”). In that case, cl 17 of the sale and purchase
                    agreement stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Purchaser shall be liable and shall pay for the Goods and Services Tax
                        and the stamp fees in respect of or in connection with the sale and purchase
                        of the Vendor’s share in the Property or the said sale price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was useful to bear in mind that there were
                    a few cases on the liability for GST before condition 7.3.1 was introduced
                    by the 1999 Conditions of Sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Kuo Ching Yun and
                        another v H &amp; L Investments Holding Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R)
                    276 (“<em>Kuo Ching Yun</em>”), a question
                    arose whether the purchaser of a non-residential property was obliged to pay the
                    GST on the purchase price of the property. The 1994 Conditions of Sale were
                    incorporated as part of the terms of the sale. One of the points was whether
                    condition 12 of the 1994 Conditions of Sale imposed an obligation on the
                    purchaser to pay the GST. Condition 12 is a different provision from condition
                    7.3.1 which I was considering and I need not set out condition 12 here. It
                    suffices for me to say that the High Court in that case decided that condition
                    12 did not impose an obligation on the purchaser to pay the GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Challenger Technologies
                        Pte Ltd v Sheares Edwin Charles Hingwee and others</em> [1998] 2
                    SLR(R) 292 (“<em>Challenger
                    Technologies</em>”), a vendor who had already completed the sale
                    and purchase of a property then sought to claim the GST from the purchaser. The
                    High Court in that case concluded that it was not a term of the agreement for
                    the sale and purchase that the purchaser was to bear the GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I come back to the case of <em>Woon Wee Hao</em> which I referred to at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above. As I mentioned, cl 17 of the sale and purchase
                    agreement there clearly provided that the purchaser was to pay for the GST. In
                    that case, the vendor was advised that the sale of his undivided share in a
                    property could attract GST. He then claimed the GST from the purchaser who
                    refused to pay it. To avoid jeopardising the sale, the vendor completed the sale
                    and reserved his right to claim the GST from the purchaser. Thereafter, the
                    vendor filed an action to seek a declaration that the clear liability of the
                    purchaser to pay the GST under the sale and purchase agreement had not merged in
                    the transfer upon the completion, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    contractual obligation was not extinguished by the transfer of title.
                    Apparently, the purchaser argued that as the vendor was not registered for the
                    purpose of GST at the time of completion, no GST was payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Court of Appeal concluded that there was
                    nothing in the sale and purchase agreement which suggested that the cl 17
                    obligation was predicated on the payment of GST being exigible upon completion
                    of the sale and purchase. Referring with approval to an earlier High Court
                    decision in <em>ACS Computer Pte Ltd v Rubina Watch Co (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 1006, the Court of Appeal decided that the
                    contractual obligation did not merge into the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I mentioned <em>Woon Wee
                        Hao</em> again because counsel for the Purchasers suggested that it
                    was because of that case that condition 7.3.1 was introduced. That is not
                    correct. As I have mentioned, the contractual provision in that case clearly
                    imposed the liability to pay GST on the purchaser. The issue there was whether
                    the contractual obligation had merged into the transfer. It is
                    condition 7.3.2 of the 1999 Conditions of Sale, not condition 7.3.1,
                    which addresses the issue in <em>Woon Wee
                Hao</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It seemed to me that condition 7.3.1 was
                    introduced because of <em>Kuo Ching Yun</em> and <em>Challenger Technologies</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Prior to condition 7.3.1, the default
                    position in the absence of a contractual provision to the contrary was that the
                    vendor was to bear the GST. Incorporating the 1994 Conditions of Sale did not
                    affect this position. The question then was whether condition 7.3.1 of the
                    1999 Conditions of Sale effected a change and imposed the liability for GST on
                    the purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Counsel for the Vendor submitted that the
                    terms of condition 7.3.1 clearly stipulated for a purchaser to pay GST.
                    However, the provision does not simply say that the purchaser is to pay GST. It
                    states that the purchaser is to pay GST “on completion or earlier as
                    required by the Comptroller”. There is no definition of “the
                    Comptroller” in the 1999 Conditions of Sale. Presumably it refers to the
                    Comptroller of GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In other words, as drafted, the literal
                    interpretation of condition 7.3.1 focuses on the time of payment of GST. It
                    assumes that a purchaser is liable for GST. In that sense, one may argue that it
                    does not impose the liability to pay GST on a purchaser and any such imposition
                    must be found somewhere else, if at all imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Counsel for the Vendor also relied on some
                    materials issued in 2010 by the Board of Legal Education for the Preparatory
                    Course leading to Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations. In Volume 4 on
                    Conveyancing, there is a passage at p 81 which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the <b>Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap
                            117A)</b> the vendor is liable to the Comptroller of GST for the
                        payment of any GST payable. However, in the case where a contract is
                        governed by the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1999, the
                        vendor is entitled to claim such GST from the purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I did not give any weight to this text as its
                    provenance was not properly established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>, condition 7.3.1 was not well drafted. Nevertheless, I was
                    of the view that its purpose was to incorporate two points, <em>ie</em>, firstly, to stipulate that the purchaser is to pay GST and,
                    secondly, to pay it on completion or earlier. I did not think that the
                    introduction of condition 7.3.1 was to deal only with the timing of payment of
                    GST by a purchaser when there was no other provision in the 1999 Conditions
                    of Sale to impose liability on a purchaser in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the circumstances, I made the declarations
                    sought by the Vendor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As for the Vendor’s claim for damages
                    for being precluded from utilising the Deposit, it appeared that CNP had in its
                    letter dated 27 August 2010, informed LBLC that the Purchasers had
                    commenced legal proceedings to claim specific performance of the sale and
                    purchase agreement. CNP also demanded that the Vendor refrain from forfeiting
                    the Deposit and from reselling the Property pending the outcome of the
                    proceedings failing which they would apply for an injunction to restrain the
                    Vendor from doing either of the above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     LBLC replied on 30 August 2010 to state,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that they would hold the Deposit
                    pending the outcome of the legal proceedings on the Purchasers’
                    undertaking to pay damages and/or loss of interest. It was unclear whether the
                    Purchasers gave that undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I did not allow the Vendor’s claim for
                    damages for not utilising the Deposit as the facts in support of that claim were
                    not pleaded. There was also no elaboration as to whether LBLC had earned any
                    interest on the Deposit (or part thereof) and whether it would pass the benefit
                    of the interest to the Vendor. In any event, the Vendor has benefitted from the
                    forfeiture of the Deposit and from the rise in value of the Property since the
                    date of the expiry of the 21-day notices. The latter point was confirmed by the
                    Vendor’s counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There are some other points which I would like
                    to elaborate on which I hope will be of assistance to parties and their
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When a dispute arises on the interpretation of
                    a contractual or statutory provision, it is only natural that every means should
                    be made to resolve it amicably or on an interim basis, for example, by making
                    payment of any disputed sum under protest or to a stakeholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, if there is no amicable settlement or
                    interim solution, then the parties should file an action as soon as possible to
                    seek a court ruling before it is too late and not wait till the contractual date
                    of completion or when a notice to complete is given or has expired. Time is
                    critical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In addition, the appropriate mode of
                    commencing such an action is the originating summons and not the writ of
                    summons. The advantage of an originating summons procedure, if properly used, is
                    that there is no need for pleadings and discovery and its hearing date is much
                    earlier than for a writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Moreover, as a matter of caution, one should
                    consider applying for interim relief in respect of the completion of the sale
                    and purchase agreement in case the originating summons is not heard in time.
                    Thus, for example, where a purchaser declines to make payment of the disputed
                    sum to a vendor because of a genuine fear of dissipation of that sum and the
                    vendor in turn declines to agree that the disputed sum be held by a stakeholder,
                    the purchaser should apply for an interim order to complete the sale with
                    provision being made for the disputed sum. If the court considers it
                    unreasonable for the vendor to decline a stakeholdership arrangement, it can
                    nevertheless order completion to be effected and the disputed sum to be paid to
                    a stakeholder or into court which is effectively the same thing. If the court
                    does not consider it reasonable to withhold the disputed sum from the vendor for
                    the time being, it can order that sum to be paid to the vendor on completion
                    pending the outcome of the action. Whichever interim order is made, the sale and
                    purchase transaction is preserved and the scope of the dispute is restricted to
                    the disputed sum as should be the case. The disputed sum should not be allowed
                    to jeopardise the entire transaction.</p>
