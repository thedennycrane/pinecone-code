<p>[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal to this decision in Civil Appeal No 17 of 2015 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 22 March 2017 in so far as the issue of upkeep costs was concerned. However, the Court of Appeal recognised the appellant’s right to claim, as general damages, a sum in recompense of the injury which she had suffered to her interest in “genetic affinity”.

        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a Singaporean woman of Chinese
                    descent married to a German of Caucasian descent. The first defendant, Thomson
                    Medical Pte Ltd is a private hospital. It was approved by the Ministry of Health
                    to provide the In-Vitro Fertilisation (“IVF”) procedure to couples
                    who wish to conceive. IVF involves the removal of eggs from a woman and having
                    them fertilised by sperms in a laboratory. Viable fertilised eggs are then
                    implanted in the woman with the intention of establishing a successful
                    pregnancy. The second defendant, Thomson Fertility Centre Pte Ltd, is a
                    fertility clinic wholly owned by the first defendant and located within the
                    first defendant’s premises. The third defendant, Dr Eleanor Quah, is
                    a senior embryologist with the second defendant. The fourth defendant,
                    Dr Chia Choy May was the Chief Embryologist with the second
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff and her husband wanted to have a
                    family soon after marriage but had difficulty conceiving. In 2006, they sought
                    medical advice from a consultant obstetrician who advised them to try IVF. In
                    2007, the couple went to the second defendant for IVF treatment that was
                    successful and they had a son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2009, the couple went for another IVF at the
                    second defendant as they were keen to have more children. In October 2010 the
                    plaintiff delivered a daughter (named “Baby P” in this action).
                    When the IVF procedure was carried out in respect of Baby P, by mistake the
                    plaintiff’s egg was fertilised with the sperm of a third party Indian male
                    (“the donor”) instead of the sperm of the plaintiff’s
                    husband. The third defendant was the embryologist who was responsible for (1)
                    the collection and storage of the bottle containing the plaintiff’s
                    husband’s semen; (2) verifying the details on the bottle containing the
                    semen as being that of the plaintiff’s husband; and (3) fertilising the
                    plaintiff’s egg with her husband’s sperm. The fourth defendant, the
                    Chief Embryologist, was the third defendant’s supervisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The couple later discovered the mistake in the
                    IVF procedure when they found that Baby P’s skin tone and hair colour was
                    different from that of the couple and their son and she also had a blood type
                    that did not match those of the couple. On 4 June 2012, the plaintiff sued
                    the defendants in the tort of negligence. The plaintiff also sued the 3rd
                    defendant for breach of contract in the alternative as both of them entered into
                    a contract. The terms of that contract included a promise to fertilise the
                    plaintiff’s egg with her husband’s sperm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff’s relief includes a claim
                    for Baby P’s upkeep. The expenses for the upkeep include those relating
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The care of Baby P in Beijing where
                        she would live with the plaintiff, her husband and the
                    son;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Baby P’s
                        pre-schooling educational needs in Beijing where she will be cared
                        for;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Schooling
                        in a German International School in Beijing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Tertiary education in a German college or
                        university;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     Necessities including apparels and food until Baby P is financially
                        self-reliant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     Baby P’s hobbies and extra-curricular activities until she reached
                        the age of adulthood and is financially self-reliant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     Travel and holiday
                    expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_h"></a>(h)     Medical
                        expenses and/or medical insurance; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a>(i)     Additional maid care to look after Baby P until she starts
                        schooling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 16 July 2012, the defendants filed their
                    defence. On 8 October 2012, the defendants filed Summons No 5179 of 2012
                    (“SUM 5179/2012”) to have a question of law determined. The first
                    was the issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled to the upkeep claim. The
                    second concerned the claim for provisional damages, by which the plaintiff
                    sought to make the defendants liable for damages (until Baby P reaches
                    35 years of age) arising from any genetic condition or disease that might
                    be attributable to the genes of the donor. The defendants applied to strike out
                    these two claims from the action. The learned Assistant Registrar David Lee
                    (“AR Lee”) agreed with the defendant’s counsel’s
                    submission that these claims were contrary to public policy, and thus ruled
                    against the plaintiff in both issues in the question of law. Those portions of
                    the claims were then struck out from the action. The plaintiff appealed only
                    against the order regarding the upkeep claim. I heard the appeal on
                    20 January 2014 and allowed it on 25 February 2014 (see: [2014]
                    SGHC 36). I held that it is inappropriate that an application to strike out
                    was brought in a case such as this as the claim on reasonableness of damages was
                    challenged on law and that the issue of damages should not be heard in isolation
                    because both the liability and damages aspects of the case are connected. The
                    matter was not heard as a preliminary point of law in respect of liability and
                    quantum although counsel for both sides appeared to have proceeded as such in
                    their submissions before me as well as before AR Lee (at: [13]). On
                    8 July 2014, the plaintiff amended her Statement of Claim to delete the
                    claim for provisional damages. On 14 August 2014, an interlocutory judgment
                    was entered against the defendants by consent with damages to be assessed and
                    costs and interest reserved to a Judge or Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendants then took out Summons No 4264 of
                    2014 (“SUM 4246/2014”) under O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) on 28 August 2014 to have tried as a preliminary issue in
                    the action before the trial for assessment of damages the question of whether
                    the plaintiff is entitled to the upkeep claim as a matter of law. Order 33 r 2
                    of the Rules of Court reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Time, etc., of trial of questions
                            or issues (O. 33, r. 2</b>)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court may order any question or issue arising in a cause or matter,
                        whether of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law, and whether
                        raised by the pleadings or otherwise, to be tried before, at or after the
                        trial of the cause or matter, and may give directions as to the manner in
                        which the question or issue shall be stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I heard SUM 4246/2014 on 13 October 2014 and reserved
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr N Sreenivasan, SC, counsel for the plaintiff,
                    says the application raises two issues. The first being whether the question
                    postulated by the defendants ought to be determined as a preliminary issue, and
                    second, whether the plaintiff is entitled in law to claim damages for Baby
                    P’s upkeep. In respect of the first issue, Mr Sreenivasan says he was
                    prepared to “leave the same” to me and will proceed to submit on
                    the second. He stopped short of saying that he concedes the first issue and did
                    not make any submissions on whether the first issue should be decided in his
                    client’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Lok Vi Ming, SC, counsel for the
                    defendants, submits that application should be determined as a preliminary issue
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the determination of the
                        question of law will lead to substantial savings in both time and costs.
                        This is because if the question is answered in the negative, the parties
                        need not adduce further evidence on the upkeep claim. Mr Lok says that
                        foreign expert witnesses are needed as the expenses for Baby P’s
                        upkeep include those that have to be incurred in Beijing and
                    Germany;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the
                        question of law can be determined independently of the evidence that will be
                        adduced in the assessment of damages trial. The question of whether the
                        upkeep claim is permitted is a purely a question of law that can be
                        determined based on applicable legal principles and/or public
                    policy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, there
                        are precedents where the courts have tried issues of upkeep as a preliminary
                        issue or on a summary basis. In this regard, Mr Lok relies on the
                        following six authorities where the court has done so: (1) <em>Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHS Trust</em> [2004]
                        1 AC 309 (“<em>Rees</em>”); (2)
                            <em>Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital
                            NHS Trust</em> [2001] 3 WLR 376 (“<em>Parkinson</em>”); (3) <em>A (A Minor) v A
                            Health &amp; Social Services Trust</em> [2010] NIQB 108; (4)
                            <em>Rouse v Wesley</em> (1992) 196 Mich App 624;
                        (5) <em>Chaffee v Seslar</em> (2003) 786 N E 2d 705;
                        and (6) <em>Boone v Mullendore</em> (1982) 416 So 2d
                        718.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I accept that the question postulated by the defendants ought to
                    be determined as a preliminary issue for the same reasons given by Mr
                    Lok.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I now deal with the second issue of whether
                    the plaintiff is entitled in law to claim damages for Baby P’s upkeep. Mr
                    Sreenivasan submits that the upkeep claim should be allowed, whether in contract
                    or in tort for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the upkeep claim should be
                        allowed in tort on the grounds of public policy and that it involved
                        reasonably foreseeable damage. Mr Sreenivasan pointed out that the
                        Termination of Pregnancy Act (Cap 324, 1985 Rev Ed) (“TPA”)
                        gives the right to any female to decide for herself whether to terminate a
                        pregnancy. The TPA remains the law of the land and to a “major extent
                        marks out the public perception towards abortion”. Had the plaintiff
                        been told about the mix-up early, she would have been able to terminate the
                        pregnancy, but once that opportunity passed, the defendants must contemplate
                        that someone would have been obliged to bring up the
                    baby;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the
                        decision of the majority in the High Court of Australia decision (on appeal
                        from the Supreme Court of Queensland) in <em>Cattanach v
                            Melchior</em> [2003] 215 CLR 1 (“<em>Cattanach</em>”) ought to be followed. That case concerned
                        a claim for the expenses of bringing up a child conceived after the mother
                        was negligently advised that the sterilisation procedure was complete and no
                        contraception was required. The majority (four-to-three) allowed the
                        claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the decision of the majority (four-to-one) in the House of Lords in
                            <em>McFarlene v Tayside Health Board</em> [2000]
                        2 AC 59 (“<em>McFarlene</em>”) that
                        formed the opposite view from the majority in <em>Cattanach</em> ought not to be followed. <em>McFarlene</em> also concerned a claim for upkeep of a child
                        conceived after the mother was negligently advised that the sterilisation
                        procedure was complete and no contraception was required. <em>McFarlene</em> was not an appropriate precedent to follow for
                        these reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The court in <em>McFarlene</em> was constrained by its
                            characterisation of the claim as one for pure economic loss. The court
                            therefore could not circumvent the “general reluctance” in
                            England in allowing claims for pure economic loss only under very
                            exceptional circumstances. However, our Court of Appeal in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp;
                                Technology Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”) has made it clear that
                            Singapore’s position is different from that in England in that the
                            Singapore courts are prepared to allow claims for pure economic
                            loss;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Having made clear that it was not basing its decision on public
                            policy reasons, the majority decision in <em>McFarlene</em> cannot then be relied on to support any public
                            policy reasons against the upkeep claim obliquely;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       
              <em>McFarlene</em> cannot be rationalised as
                            upkeep claims are now allowed for cases involving disabled children
                            conceived due to failed sterilisation. In this regard,
                            Mr Sreenivasan relies on <em>Parkinson</em>
                            and <em>Rees.</em> He further submits that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">The argument that sanctity of life would be defiled by allowing a
                                monetary claim for the upkeep of a child if valid, we submit, should
                                apply equally without disparity to both healthy and disabled
                                children in failed sterili[s]ation cases. The life of a disabled
                                child is as precious as that of a healthy child. Hence, it would be
                                odd to allow claims in respect of disabled children for upkeep but
                                deny such a claim in respect of healthy children by citing …
                                the “sanctity of life” argument as was done in [the]
                                    <em>McFarlene</em> case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, not allowing the upkeep claim would deprive the plaintiff of a
                        remedy and it is reprehensible to provide immunity to the defendants;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the
                        upkeep claim was not remote in the plaintiff’s alternative cause of
                        action under breach of contract as the upkeep claim would have been within
                        the 3rd defendant’s contemplation at the time when they entered into
                        the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Lok submits that the upkeep claim
                    should be denied for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, <em>McFarlene</em> is an appropriate precedent. It rightly
                        underscored the unease in allowing upkeep claims for a healthy child.
                        Allowing damages compensating for the “wrong” or
                        “injury” in the birth of a healthy child is “morally
                        repugnant and against public policy” as the birth of a healthy child
                        is a blessing and not a liability;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, <em>Cattanach</em> should
                        not be followed for two reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       It was overturned by
                            legislation. Within 4 months of the delivery of the decision in
                                <em>Cattanach</em>, Queensland’s
                            Parliament included ss 49A and 49B in the Civil Liability Act 2003
                            to provide that “a court cannot award damages for economic loss
                            arising out of the costs ordinarily associated with rearing or
                            maintaining a child” in cases of failed sterilisation procedures,
                            failed contraceptive procedures or contraceptive advice. Mr Lok
                            submits that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">It would appear from the above that the holding in <em>Cattanach</em> was so repugnant to the societal
                                psyche and so clearly against public policy considerations that the
                                legislature had to act swiftly to reverse the holding by the
                                amendments to the Queensland Civil Liability Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       
              <em>Cattanach</em> had not been
                            “well-received” by the courts in England (<em>Rees</em>), Ireland (<em>Byrne v
                                Ryan</em> [2009] 4 IR 542) and Canada (see the decision of the
                            Supreme Court of British Columbia in <em>Bevilacqua v
                                Altenkirk</em> [2004] BCSC 945). Even in Australia itself, the
                            courts have not “wholeheartedly embraced” the
                            majority’s ruling in <em>Cattanach</em>. For
                            example, the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in
                                <em>G and M v Sydney Robert Armellin</em>
                            [2008] ACTSC 68 agreed with the reasoning of the minority in <em>Cattanach</em> but it was bound and had no choice but
                            to follow the majority’s ruling. The Supreme Court of New South
                            Wales in <em>Waller v James</em> [2013] NSWSC 497
                            sought to confine the application of <em>Cattanach</em> to cases where the parents did not want a
                            child at all; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the upkeep claim is too remote in the
                        plaintiff’s alternative cause of action under breach of contract.
                        Mr Lok submits that remoteness is also concerned with the wider policy
                        considerations of placing limits on contractual liabilities. Hence, damages
                        can be refused on policy grounds, even if they are
                    foreseeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although both counsel accepted that the law
                    obliges the parent to bring up the child, Mr Sreenivasan referred to
                    s 70(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“WC”) as a basis for imposing financial obligations on the
                    defendants. Section 70(1) of the WC reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Duty to maintain child accepted as
                            member of family</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>70.</b>—(1) Where a person has accepted a
                        child who is not his child as a member of his family, it shall be his duty
                        to maintain that child while he remains a child, so far as the father or the
                        mother of the child fails to do so, and the court may make such orders as
                        may be necessary to ensure the welfare of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I should deal with this point first as it is not relevant. Section
                    70(1) of the WC allows persons who have accepted a child into their family to
                    seek a court order compelling the child’s father or mother to pay for the
                    child’s upkeep. The person who might be liable under s 70(1) of the
                    WC in this case can only have been the donor, but I doubt that he would have
                    been ordered by any court to pay for Baby P’s upkeep, given the
                    circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     For the reasons that follow, I reject the
                    arguments made by Mr Sreenivasan and hold that the plaintiff is not
                    entitled in law to claim damages for Baby P’s upkeep.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     First, I am not convinced by
                    Mr Sreenivasan’s submission that the defendants should bear the
                    entire cost of maintaining a healthy child simply because she missed the
                    opportunity to abort Baby P. I think that this submission is a mere afterthought
                    as the plaintiff did not even plead her missed opportunity to abort Baby P. She
                    did not depose in any of the affidavits filed by her that had she been informed
                    about the mix-up earlier, she would have aborted Baby P. Even if this submission
                    was genuine and not a mere afterthought, I am of the view that it has no merits.
                    I am not aware of any authority that supports Mr Sreenivasan’s
                    submission. I agree entirely with Lord Clyde in <em>McFarlene</em> at 105, that it would be “going beyond what
                    should constitute a reasonable restitution for the wrong done” to allow
                    the plaintiff’s claim for the lost opportunity to an
                abortion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Second, the plaintiff had wanted a second
                    child all along. The contest of legal authorities before me was the differing
                    views between <em>McFarlene</em> and <em>Cattanach</em>. As mentioned (see above: [10(b)] and [10(c)]), both
                    cases concerned claims by parent(s) for the expenses of bringing up a child
                    conceived after the mother was negligently advised that the sterilisation
                    procedure was complete and no contraception was required. These are referred to
                    as “wrongful birth”, “unwanted birth” or
                    “unwanted pregnancy” cases (see <em>eg</em>:
                    John L Powell QC &amp; Roger Steward QC, <em>Jackson
                        &amp; Powell on Professional Liability</em> (7th Ed, Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell) at paras 13-095–13-100; and Margaret Fordham, “Blessing or
                    Burden? Recent Developments in Actions for Wrongful Conception and Wrongful
                    Birth in the U.K. and Australia” [2004] Sing J L S 462). But there is a
                    crucial difference between those cases and the present application before me: in
                    the present case, Baby P was not an unwanted birth in the sense that the
                    plaintiff mother did not want to have a baby at all. The plaintiff just wanted a
                    baby conceived with her husband’s sperm. This is an important distinction.
                    It cannot be said that the plaintiff and her husband were not contemplating
                    having to expend money to bring up a child. On the contrary, the reason they
                    engaged the defendants was so that they could have a child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In passing, I note that the issue of whether
                    an upkeep claim will be allowed for wrongful birth cases is a contentious one as
                    there is a divergence of views expressed. It may be the case that legislative
                    intervention is required. I express no definite view on this matter as it is not
                    one that I need to resolve for the present application, but there are cogent
                    policy considerations against finding liability for upkeep. Lord Millett in
                        <em>McFarlene</em> opined that “[t]here is
                    something distasteful, if not morally offensive, in treating the birth of a
                    normal, healthy child as a matter for compensation” (at 111). Similarly,
                    Hale LJ (as she then was) in <em>Parkinson</em> at [87]
                    opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No one wants a situation in which a parent who thoroughly dislikes her
                        child and the predicament in which she has been placed, but does her duty,
                        is at an advantage compared with the parent who falls in love with her child
                        at birth (as most do) and willingly reconcile herself to her fate. No one
                        wants a situation in which the parent who disparages her child is at an
                        advantage compared with one who sees the best in him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I agree entirely with the views expressed by Hale LJ, and think
                    that they apply with equal force in the present case. As I had mentioned
                    previously in this same case, no parent would want her child to grow up thinking
                    that she (the child) is a mistake. Were the plaintiff to succeed in her upkeep
                    claim, whether in tort or in contract every cent spent in the upbringing of Baby
                    P will remind her that it was money from a compensation for a mistake. Baby P
                    should not ever have to grow up thinking that her very existence was a mistake.
                    A parent is obliged to maintain his infant child. It does not matter whether the
                    child is his or her natural child, or an adopted child. When a parent has
                    accepted his role in respect of that child, the obligation is his (and his
                    spouse’s). He cannot be a parent and have someone else pay to bring up the
                    child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I therefore hold that the plaintiff is not
                    entitled in law to claim damages for Baby P’s upkeep in both contract and
                    in tort. The tortfeasors are bound to compensate the plaintiff under the
                    established heads of claim such as pain and suffering, but those other claims
                    are not in issue before me because the counsel for the parties believe that they
                    are saving time and costs by proceeding with this head of claim first. I will
                    hear the question of costs when the other claims are resolved.</p>
