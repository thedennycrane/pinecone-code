</div> The Debenture contains four key provisions which are relevant to MBB’s claim. First, cl 3.1(a) of the Debenture creates a fixed charge in favour of MBB and cl 3.1(b) creates the floating charge in favour of MBB.

Although MBB does refer to Hull 1117 in its pleadings, those references when read in context serve only as background for its claim in respect of Hull 1118. Thus, paragraph 63 of MBB’s statement of claim asserts that Hull 1117 is no longer traceable and confines it claim to Hull 1118:

This rule ensures that a defendant has reasonable advance notice of the case which it has to meet at trial: <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v </span><span class="font-italic">Intraco Ltd and others </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [22].

They are merely a means to the end of attaining a fair resolution of the parties’ dispute. The courts are thus not required to adopt an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach to procedure, and in particular to pleadings. The courts may thus allow an unpleaded point to be raised if no prejudice is caused to the other party: <span class="font-italic">Sun Electr</span><span class="font-italic">ic Pte Ltd and another v Menrva Solutions Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] SGHC 264 at [32] and <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia </span>at [40].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In the present case, however, it appears to me to be obvious that the defendants will be prejudiced if MBB’s claim were now to be taken to extend to Hull 1117. MBB’s pleadings assert a claim only in respect of Hull 1118. Hull 1117 is referred to in the pleadings merely as background. MBB through counsel confirmed this at a pre-trial conference. The defendants have, quite reasonably, taken all of that at face value in preparing for trial. They have thus conducted their entire defence on the basis that MBB’s claim is confined to Hull 1118.

To allow MBB to do so would amount to depriving the defendants of all opportunity to rebut MBB’s case on Hull 1117 and would cause them real prejudice: see <span class="font-italic">Rabiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee bte Mohamed Ibrahim v Salem Ibrahim </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 655 at [160].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Any claim which MBB might have in respect of Hull 1117 is not before me in this action and cannot now be put before me in this action.

MBB argues that certain evidence relied on by the defendants is inadmissible. The evidence relates to three issues in this action: (i) evidence of a contract said to be between Red Sea and SEAPA for the onward sale of Hulls 1117 and 1118 to SEAPA (“SEAPA Contract”); (ii) whether Red Sea was entitled to claim the liquidated damages from NGV which were alleged to form the basis of the Price Reduction Agreements; and (iii) whether Red Sea actually made the Direct Payments to NGV’s subcontractors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I address these objections in turn, starting with the admissibility of the SEAPA Contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">SEAPA Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The SEAPA Contract is relevant to the matters in question in this action because the defendants rely on it as evidence that the impugned transactions were in fact genuine transactions and not the result of any conspiracy. The defendants’ case is that, when it became likely that NGV may not perform its contractual obligation to build and deliver Hulls 1117 and 1118 on time, Red Sea took legitimate steps to protect its position under the SEAPA Contract by entering into the impugned transactions (see [18] – [29] above).

It is not for MBB to prove that none of the exceptions under s 67 of the EA are applicable.

</div> to prove the contract without producing primary evidence of it.  Section 67A was introduced into the Evidence Act by amendment in 2012 and creates an exception to the requirement that documentary evidence be proved by primary or secondary evidence as mandated by s 63 of the EA. It enables documentary evidence which is rendered admissible under s 32(1) of the EA to be proven in accordance with s 67A of the EA rather than in accordance with s 63 of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I reject Red Sea’s submission. Red Sea’s argument assumes that the SEAPA Contract is or contains “a statement of relevant fact made by a person” within the meaning of s 32(1) of the EA. I do not consider that to be the case. The SEAPA Contract, if genuine, is a document which embodies an agreement between Red Sea and SEAPA. The document itself, by reason of the parties’ signifying their bilateral assent to it in it, gives rise to the parties’ agreement. Insofar as Red Sea seeks to rely on it, the SEAPA Contract is a bilateral performative act. Red Sea does not seek to admit it because it contains “statements of relevant facts made by a person … in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation” (s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA). The SEAPA Contract is therefore outside the scope of s 32(1) of the EA entirely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Further, even if I assume in Red Sea’s favour that the SEAPA Contract comes within s 32(1) of the EA, that is not enough in itself to render a statement of relevant fact admissible. For the statement to be admissible in civil litigation, the party seeking to rely on it must also comply with the notice requirements under s 32(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA read with O 38 r 4 of the Rules. If those notice requirements are not complied with, the statement remains inadmissible even if the conditions of s 32(1) of the EA are satisfied.  In this case, Red Sea failed to comply with the notice requirements of s 32(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA. The SEAPA Contract remains inadmissible despite satisfying the requirements of s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA. Section 67A of the EA cannot assist Red Sea to prove the SEAPA Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, even if s 67A of the EA does apply, it does not mean that a document constituting or containing the statement of relevant fact can be proven otherwise than by primary evidence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, simply by producing a copy of it. Section 67A of the EA requires the “copy of that document, or of the material part of it, authenticated in a manner approved by the court”.  The copy of the SEAPA Contract which Red Sea produced at trial is not authenticated in any manner, whether by the evidence-in-chief of its witnesses (see [58]–[63] below) or otherwise, and is certainly not authenticated in a manner approved by the court.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Second and third aspects</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I also accept MBB’s argument that the evidence-in-chief of the defendants’ witnesses on the following two issues is inadmissible by reason of s 62 of the EA: (i) that Red Sea and SEAPA actually entered into the SEAPA Contract;

</div> But MBB’s failure to object to admissibility at that time does not bar MBB from objecting to admissibility at this time. And it certainly does not bar the court from now considering whether the disputed evidence is in fact admissible. This is because the provisions of the EA are mandatory. A failure to raise a timely objection to inadmissible evidence does not make the evidence admissible: <span class="font-italic">Keimfarben</span><span class="font-italic"> GmbH &amp; Co KG v Soo Nam Yuen </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 534 at [17] and <span class="font-italic">Teknikal</span><span class="font-italic"> Dan Kejuruteraan Pte Ltd v Resources Development Corporation (Pte) Ltd </span>[1992] SGHC 321.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The defendants rely on <span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ching Kai Huat and others </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagase</span>”) in support of their submission. That case is of no assistance, because it is not a case on the admissibility of evidence. The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> argued in its closing submissions for the first time that the defendants were precluded from raising positive defences to the plaintiff’s claim because the defendants’ only pleaded defence was a series of “bare denials”. But, as the court noted, “the plaintiff failed to raise any objections on the ‘bare denials’ point in respect of any affidavits in its objections to contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief”. The court thus held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">even though the bare denials would have otherwise prevented [the defendants] from raising certain defences, it is too late in the day for the plaintiff to raise any objections to the contents of the defendants’ affidavits and consequently, any arguments premised thereon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Notably, the court accepted the principle that “inadmissible evidence does not become admissible simply by reason of a party’s failure to object”, but acknowledged expressly that that principle was not the governing principle in that case (<span class="font-italic">Nagase </span>at [175]–[177]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The governing principle in <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> was not admissibility but <span class="font-italic">relevance</span>. The question which the court considered was whether a defendant may adduce evidence which is not relevant to any of its defences as pleaded and whether a plaintiff loses the right to object to irrelevant evidence if it fails to do so at the earliest opportunity (see <span class="font-italic">Nagase </span>at [175]). <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> was therefore not a case which considered whether a plaintiff loses the right to object to evidence which is <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic">admissible</span> under the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The gist of MBB’s complaint is not that the defendants’ witnesses’ evidence is irrelevant to the issues raised by the defendants’ pleadings. The gist of MBB’s complaint is that the defendants’ witnesses’ evidence on these two issues is inadmissible under the EA. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Nagase</span> is not to the point.

</div> MBB does not, however, allege in its pleadings that Malaysian law differs from Singapore law in relation to the issues in this action which arise under the Debenture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 MBB initially sought to adduce expert evidence of Malaysian law on these issues. At my suggestion, the parties instead agreed to proceed on the basis that this court may refer to cases from both Singapore and Malaysia, as well as from other commonwealth jurisdictions, in order to determine the questions of Malaysian law which arise in connection with the Debenture.

F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd)</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span>”) at [32] and [35].

Despite that, the text is the first port of call: <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant </span>at [32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The text of cl 3.1(a)(ii), the context of cl 3.1(a)(ii) and the commercial character of a fixed charge all lead me to conclude that the Debenture did not create a fixed charge over Hull 1118.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I begin with the text of cl 3.1(a)(ii).  The phrase “securities of any kind whatsoever whether marketable or otherwise and all other interests including but not limited to …” in cl 3.1(a)(ii) must be read <span class="font-italic">ejusdem</span><span class="font-italic"> generis</span> with the other parts of cl 3.1(a)(ii): see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd v Burgundy Global Exploration Corp </span>[2013] 3 SLR 1017 at [33]. This is underscored by the fact that the parties to the Debenture organised the sub-clauses in cl 3.1(a) by the type of interests over which MBB was to have a fixed charge. Clause 3.1(a)(i) created a fixed charge over NGV’s land and chattels, cl 3.1(a)(ii) over NGV’s interests in other companies, cl 3.1(a)(iii) over NGV’s intellectual property, and cl 3.1(a)(iv) over NGV’s goodwill. The further sub-categories within each sub-clause of cl 3.1(a) must thus be read <span class="font-italic">ejusdem</span><span class="font-italic"> generis</span>, as coming within each of the four broader categories into which the parties divided cl 3.1(a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Reading “securities of any kind whatsoever whether marketable or otherwise and all other interests including but not limited to …” <span class="font-italic">ejusdem</span><span class="font-italic"> generis</span> with the other parts of cl 3.1(a)(ii), the references to “securities” and “all other interests” must refer to interests in the debt or equity of other companies. This is because the other sub-categories in cl 3.1(a)(ii) – such as stocks, shares, bonds and loan capital – all relate exclusively to interests in the debt or equity of other companies. NGV’s interest in Hull 1118 is not an interest in the debt or equity of another company. Clause 3.1(a)(ii) thus did not create a fixed charge over NGV’s interest in Hull 1118.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I now turn to the context. The context within the Debenture demonstrates that NGV and MBB recognised that it made no commercial sense to create a fixed charge over NGV’s stock in trade. This is evident from their decision to use specific language to exempt stock in trade from the fixed charge created under the Debenture. Clause 3.1(a)(i) provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.1 <span class="font-underline">Fixed and Floating Charges</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [NGV] as beneficial owner hereby charges to MBB and so that the charge hereby created shall be a continuing security:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) by way of a first fixed charge:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) … all plant, machinery, motor vehicles, computers and other equipment of [NGV] both present and future … but <span class="font-italic">excluding stock</span><span class="font-italic"> in trade of [NGV]</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The term “stock in trade” refers to assets which a business trades for profit: <span class="font-italic">Yarmouth v France </span>(1887) 19 QBD 647 at 658.

That in turn would inhibit NGV’s ability to trade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It was this very aspect of the commercial character of a fixed charge which led to the innovation of the floating charge.

</div> cl 4.3 of the Debenture provides that its floating charge crystallises automatically if NGV “encumbers” Hull 1118 in favour of any third party without MBB’s consent or if any person attempts to subject Hull 1118 to a “process”. MBB contends that automatic crystallisation was triggered on the facts of this case because the effect of NGV entering into the Price Reduction Agreement and then transferring possession of and title to Hull 1118 to Red Sea without MBB’s knowledge and consent amounted to either: (a) NGV “encumbering” Hull 1118 without MBB’s consent; or (b) a person subjecting Hull 1118 to a “process”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It appears to be common ground between the parties that it is open to the holder of a floating charge and its debtor to provide by bilateral agreement in their debenture that the floating charge will crystallise automatically upon events specified in that clause occurring.

</div>
</div> That submission is far too wide and I reject it. Automatic crystallisation clauses, though valid in Singapore and Malaysian law, are not to be given a lavish interpretation. Crystallisation of a floating charge has far-reaching implications not only for the debtor but also the secured creditor and especially for third parties who continue to deal with the debtor, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by extending credit to it, unaware that the charge has crystallised automatically. The interpretation of “encumbrance” urged upon me by MBB is a lavish interpretation, unwarranted by the word itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Under the general law, and at the broadest level, an encumbrance is simply a right in the property of one person created in favour of another person. Applied to the context of security, where a person (D) is obliged to render performance of a contractual obligation to another person (C), an encumbrance granted by D in favour of C gives C the right to have recourse to property belonging to D for satisfaction in the event that D defaults in performance of the contractual obligation. The essence of an encumbrance, therefore, is that the encumbrance is a right which facilitates the satisfaction of a separate right vested in its holder: <span class="font-italic">Muhibbah Engineering (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Pemungut Duti Setem </span>[2017] 6 MLJ 564 at [60] and <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Worthy Builders Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors </span>[2015] 3 MLJ 791 at [29(c)] citing <span class="font-italic">Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims</span> (Vol 13) (LexisNexis, 2008) at pp 506–507.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The definition of “encumbrance” in the Debenture is entirely consistent with this general meaning. “Encumbrance” is defined in the definition clause of the Debenture as follows:

Underlying a mortgage is a contract pursuant to which a debtor takes on an obligation to repay money advanced by the creditor. The mortgage involves the debtor transferring to the creditor the legal title to some property belonging to the debtor and empowering the creditor to have recourse to the property for satisfaction should the debtor default in repayment of the money advanced. A mortgage is an encumbrance because the creditor gains <span class="font-italic">a righ</span><span class="font-italic">t in the property of the debtor</span>; the legal title to the property. This right <span class="font-italic">facilitate</span><span class="font-italic">s the satisfaction of the creditor’s right to be repaid</span> by the debtor. It allows the debtor to have recourse to the debtor’s property if the debtor defaults in repayment of the loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 An “encumbrance”, on the proper construction of cl 1.2, must be a transaction which creates a right in favour of a creditor in the property of a debtor which facilitates the satisfaction of some other right vested in the creditor. The transfer of possession of and title to Hull 1118 and entering into the Price Reduction Agreements are not encumbrances. These transactions were not entered into to facilitate the fulfilment of <span class="font-italic">some other right</span> vested in Red Sea. Instead, they were simply part of performing the sale of Hull 1118 to Red Sea. There was no <span class="font-italic">other right</span> vested in Red Sea when it took possession of and title to Hull 1118 and entered into the Price Reduction Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Quite apart from the meaning of “encumbrance”, however, it cannot have been the commercial intent of the parties that a transfer of possession of and title to a vessel should trigger the automatic crystallisation clause. That was the ultimate objective of NGV’s shipbuilding business: to transfer possession of and title to vessels. And the ultimate commercial objective of the floating charge was to permit NGV to carry on its business without seeking MBB’s consent to the various classes of transactions which are necessary to carry on its business. If MBB’s floating charge were to crystallise into a fixed charge every time NGV transferred possession of and title to a vessel, with or without a price reduction, NGV would have to constantly seek MBB’s consent for all such transactions. That makes no commercial sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Further, if automatic crystallisation took place upon every transfer of possession of or title to a vessel, the result would be that MBB’s floating charge would crystallise – not just over the vessel in question – but over <span class="font-italic">the whole of </span><span class="font-italic">NGV’s undertaking</span> as soon as the transfer took place. That is because the floating charge created by cl 3.1(b) of the Debenture expressly covers the whole of NGV’s undertaking (see <span class="font-italic">Dresdner Bank AG and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Ho Mun-Tuke Don and another </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [60] and <span class="font-italic">Haw Par Brothers International Ltd v Overseas Textile Co Ltd </span>[1977-1978] SLR(R) 352 at [23]). And the automatic crystallisation clause in the Debenture does not allow partial crystallisation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, crystallisation limited only to specific assets.  Once again, it is important not to give automatic crystallisation clauses a lavish interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The commercial effect of NGV needing constantly to seek MBB’s consent to a transfer of possession and title and the consequence that a failure to do so would crystallise automatically MBB’s floating charge over the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of NBV’s undertaking is that NGV’s business would constantly and automatically be paralysed. This would defeat the very purpose of granting a floating charge: to enable the chargor to raise credit secured by a charge over the whole of its business undertaking without inhibiting its ability to trade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I recognise that one way to deal with this commercial result would be under the express “decrystallisation” clause in cl 4.4:

So it is possible, in theory, for MBB’s charge to crystallise automatically every time NGV transfers possession of and title to a vessel and then for MBB to refloat the floating charge over the whole of NGV’s undertaking save for the vessel. However, in my view, this possibility does not adequately address the commercial impracticality which MBB’s interpretation of the automatic crystallisation clause entails. This is because the floating charge would still bite, and NGV’s business would still be paralysed until MBB issued notice in writing refloating the charge on the remainder of NGV’s undertaking. This would render the floating charge created by the Debenture no different in substance from a fixed charge, and would have the same result of constantly disrupting NGV’s business.

The requirement for the Statement appears to have been included more for Riyad Bank’s and Red Sea’s benefit than for MBB’s. The Statement was required only when the method of payment changed to irrevocable letters of credit issued by Riyad Bank. As the issuing bank for the letter of credit and as the applicant for the letter of credit respectively, Riyad Bank and Red Sea had a clear interest in ensuring that they were receiving good title to the vessels, free of encumbrances. As the defendants’ witness testified, the lawyers included the requirement for the Statement in the letter of credit as “an abundance of caution” to ensure such good title.

</div> For this proposition, MBB relies on <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph Products Ltd v The Heating </span><span class="font-italic">Centre Pty Ltd (in liq) and others </span>(1992) 7 ACSR 365 (“<span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph</span>”). I am unable to agree with MBB. Merely dealing with an asset which is subject to a floating charge outside the ordinary course of a company’s business does not crystallise a floating charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph </span>does not stand for the proposition for which MBB cites it. In that case, the appellant, FN, supplied goods to a customer, THC. THC had granted a creditor, AGC, a floating charge over its undertaking. THC was in possession of a certain quantity of goods which it had purchased from FN. Title in all of the goods had passed to THC, but THC had not paid FN for all of the goods. Both FN and THC were experiencing financial difficulties. FN and THC entered into an agreement which purported to revest in FN title in the goods which THC had purchased from FN but not yet paid for. AGC appointed receivers over THC. FN asked THC’s receivers to return the goods. THC’s receivers refused and instead sold the goods for the benefit of AGC. FN sued THC’s receivers in conversion, asserting that title to the goods which the receivers had sold had revested in FN by reason of the revesting agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 It bears emphasising that <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph</span> was a case of automatic crystallisation, not a case of crystallisation by operation of law. AGC’s debenture in <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph</span> contained the following automatic crystallisation clause:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if the mortgagor shall deal with all or any of the mortgaged property other than in the ordinary course of its ordinary business then the floating charge herein created shall ipso facto become fixed to all of the mortgaged property at the moment immediately prior to such dealing and at that point of time the mortgagee shall be deemed to have intervened and to have exercised all or any of its rights of intervention in respect of all the mortgaged property …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This clause not only provided for automatic crystallisation, but also for the automatic crystallisation to be retrospective: AGC’s floating charge was said to become a fixed charge “at the moment immediately prior to” the triggering event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The question before the Supreme Court of New South Wales was whether THC’s act of entering into the revesting agreement with FN had triggered the automatic crystallisation clause, and had crystallised AGC’s floating charge at the moment immediately prior to THC entering into the agreement, thereby converting AGC’s floating charge over the goods into a fixed charge immediately before the revesting agreement took effect. If so, FN took title to the goods under the revesting agreement subject to AGC’s fixed charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The court held unanimously that THC’s act of entering into the revesting agreement was not an ordinary transaction entered into in the ordinary course of THC’s business. But it did so because it held that a “dealing with assets … subject to a floating charge otherwise than with a view to<span class="font-italic"> carrying on the </span><span class="font-italic">chargor’s business </span>is a crystallising event” (<span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph </span>at 379) [emphasis added]. In other words, THC’s act of entering into the revesting agreement with FN crystallised the floating charge because it entered into the agreement otherwise than with a view to continuing in business. At the time THC entered into the revesting agreement, there was “no realistic basis for thinking that THC would continue in business” and the revesting agreement “was nothing more than a way of (FN) recovering its money from an insolvent debtor by return of stock” (<span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph </span>at 370).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 It is thus apparent that <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph </span>does not stand for the proposition that merely dealing with assets which are subject to a floating charge outside of the ordinary course of a company’s ordinary business suffices automatically to crystallise a floating charge. <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph </span>requires that the dealing be outside the ordinary course of business in the sense that it is otherwise than with a view to <span class="font-italic">carrying on</span> the business (at 379):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The sale of the undertaking is but an example of dealing with the assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, that is to say … otherwise than with a view to carrying on the concern.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See also <span class="font-italic">Re Lin Securities </span>at [73]–[74]; <span class="font-italic">Re City Securities Pte </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 413 at [69] and <span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span> (Louise Gullifer, ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode</span>”) at para 5–42.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As I have pointed out, <span class="font-italic">Fire Nymph</span> was a case which turned on the interpretation of an automatic crystallisation clause. MBB relies on it, however, as authority for a crystallising event which arises separately from an express automatic crystallisation clause. Even on that basis, it seems to me there is no reason why merely dealing with an asset within the scope of a floating charge outside the ordinary course of a company’s business should in itself crystallise a floating charge when the terms of the debenture do not expressly provide for that consequence. The commercial rationale for the security provided by a floating charge is to enable a company to offer its undertaking as security for credit without inhibiting its ability to trade. Once it ceases to trade or is disabled from trading, the commercial rationale for the floating charge disappears. It is only at that point that there is no longer a commercial need for the charge to float. It is only then that the floating charge crystallises into a fixed charge: <span class="font-italic">Goode </span>at para 4–37.

Rejecting the proposition that any dealing with an asset which is within the scope of a floating charge outside the ordinary course of a company’s business is a crystallising event does not “make nonsense of the entire framework of financing and security transactions” as MBB submits. It is instead very much in line with the framework, which recognises that such an event is not a crystallising event, unless the parties expressly agree, and therefore recognises that the creditor can protect itself in other ways (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>negative pledges and guarantees).

This is because, until the floating charge crystallises, the chargor has implied authority to dispose of its assets in the ordinary course of its business. But this is subject to an exception.

</div> In my view, Red Sea would not have had a contractual right of set-off. And whether Red Sea would have had an equitable right of set-off would depend on whether the sums were incurred before or after the floating charge crystallised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 There would not have been a contractual right of set-off because there was no contract between Red Sea and MBB, let alone a contract providing for a right of set-off.

Whether there is mutuality between Red Sea’s claim for the sums it has expended and MBB’s claim for title to Hull 1118 depends on when the sums were spent. If the sums were spent before the floating charge crystallised, MBB would not have had an interest in Hull 1118 at that point in time (<span class="font-italic">Diablo Fortune</span> at [51]).

</div> There is thus no evidence as to when Hulls 1090 and 1091 were delivered to Bakri. The liquidated damages for Hulls 1090 and 1091 are calculated by reference to the date on which the two vessels were actually delivered.

The Price Reduction Agreements record that Bakri and NGV recognise that Hulls 1090 and 1091 “will not be delivered on the date as agreed” and therefore as “full and final compensation in respect of damages incurred by” Bakri, NGV agreed to a price reduction of US$1.5m each for Hulls 1117 and 1118.

</div> Neither of the witness whom the defendants chose to call at trial can give direct evidence of the fact of the price reduction within the meaning of s 62 of the EA (see [64]–[65]). The only evidence of the fact of the price reduction is the statement of that fact which is recorded in the Price Reduction Agreement. But that statement is admissible in evidence only if: (a) the Price Reduction Agreement is proved in accordance with the EA; and (b) if that statement is rendered admissible as evidence of the truth of its contents by satisfying the conditions imposed in s 32 of the EA. The Price Reduction Agreements cannot prove themselves. They must be proved by a witness who is able to speak to the fact that the Price Reduction Agreements were entered into and that the statements of fact set out in the agreements are true. And the Price Reduction Agreements do not satisfy the conditions for admissibility under s 32 of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I therefore find that the defendants have failed to prove the basis for Bakri’s claim for the liquidated damages which formed the basis of the Price Reduction Agreement and the fact that the price reduction was in fact implemented.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Alteration of contract price for Hull 1118</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 MBB claims that the defendants knew that the contract price of Hull 1118 could not be altered without MBB’s consent.

The court retains a discretion to determine whether there should be an inquiry into the damages payable on the undertaking. In exercising this discretion, the courts consider all circumstances of the case. In particular, the court must be satisfied that the injunction was wrongly sought and that there are no special circumstances militating against enforcing the undertaking: <span class="font-italic">Neptune Capital Group Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 Pte Ltd and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1177 at [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Having found that MBB does not have a superior interest in Hull 1118, I find that the Injunction was wrongly secured. It thus remains for MBB to show, in a separate hearing which will follow this judgment, whether there are any special circumstances militating against the enforcement of its undertaking, and, if it is enforced, for Red Sea to show an arguable case that it has sustained a loss falling within the terms of MBB’s undertaking.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Since then, the tort of malicious prosecution has been definitively held not to apply to civil proceedings <span class="font-italic">generally</span>. The tort continues to apply to specific categories of civil proceedings where case law has recognised its applicability. One such category is proceedings in relation to the arrest of a ship. The categories of specific civil proceedings where the tort applies are not to be expanded absent extremely persuasive reasons. See <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2018] 2 SLR 866 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Tat</span>”) at [84] and [128].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>found that the underlying commonality between the specific categories of civil proceedings in which the tort of malicious prosecution has been recognised (or at least the ones relevant to this case) is that they involve “<span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>interlocutory orders by the party initiating the proceedings, the effect of which is (potentially at least) to inflict immediate and perhaps even irreversible damage to the reputation of the other party”: <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>at [77]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Once the Injunction is left out of account, no aspect of the present case is within any of the categories of specific civil proceedings to which the tort of malicious prosecution has been held to apply. I decline to extend the tort of malicious prosecution to this category of case. These are general commercial proceedings. On MBB’s primary case, this action is between a creditor claiming a security interest and defendants who claim to have defeated the security interest. On MBB’s alternative case, this action is between an alleged victim of the tort of conspiracy and the alleged conspirators. It cannot be said that this action in itself has caused immediate and irreversible damage to the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>noted at [94] and [120], persons in the defendants’ position are not without a remedy. They have recourse to the usual procedural orders and costs consequences, and had the opportunity to bring this action to a prompt end, for example, by applying to strike out MBB’s statement of claim. And insofar as the Injunction is concerned, they have the benefit of MBB’s undertaking as to damages. It is still open to them to persuade me that an inquiry as to damages should be ordered. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189  For the reasons above, I hold in favour of the defendants on the claim and the plaintiff on the counterclaim for malicious prosecution.
