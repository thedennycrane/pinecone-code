<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Lim Ah Sia (“Lim”),
                    is a minority shareholder in the 3rd defendant, VStars Business (Singapore) Pte
                    Ltd (“the Company”). He brought proceedings seeking relief under s
                    216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) on the ground that the affairs of
                    the Company were conducted in a manner oppressive or in disregard of his
                    interest as a shareholder of the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Further, he also sought a declaration that the
                    1st and 2nd defendants, Tiong Tuang Yeong (“Tiong”) and Corrine Ng
                    (“Corrine”), had acted in breach of their duties as directors.
                    Lastly, he also sought in the alternative a declaration that it was just and
                    equitable to wind up the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 7 April 2014, I informed counsel that I found
                    that there was oppression and that the most appropriate remedy was a buyout of
                    Lim’s shares. I then directed that the parties work out the detailed
                    structure of the buyout and to return to me when it was ready. The parties
                    indicated to me that they were unable to agree on a buyout figure, and a
                    separate hearing was fixed on 21 July 2014 to deal with the outstanding
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Company was incorporated on 6 November 1996.
                    Lim and Tiong were two of the initial members of the company. The other two
                    founding members were Han Jong Kwang (“Han”) and Low Kin Wai
                    (“Low”). Lim met Tiong sometime in 1993 or 1994, when they were
                    both teaching computer training courses at Jing Tian Computer Services Pte Ltd.
                    Tiong had known Han for about 12 years at the time of the Company’s
                        incorporation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> I will refer to Lim,
                    Tiong, Han and Low collectively as the “Initial Shareholders”.
                    Each of the Initial Shareholders had a 20% stake in the Company at the outset,
                    except for Low, who had a 40% shareholding. All of them were also the
                    Company’s directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Company was initially set up with the
                    intention of entering into a joint venture with a Hong Kong-based company. This
                    led to the incorporation in 1997 of a joint venture company, Vanda Systems
                    Integration Pte Ltd (“VSI”), which employed all the Initial
                    Shareholders, except Low.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, the joint venture broke down just
                    two years later, in 1999.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Company’s shareholding in VSI
                    was purchased by the other party in the joint venture.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the collapse of the joint venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Despite the fact that the original purpose of
                    the Company no longer existed, the Initial Shareholders decided to expand the
                    Company’s own business. All of the Initial Shareholders therefore went on
                    to join the Company as employees. Han and Tiong joined the Company as employees
                    on 1 January 2000. Lim followed on 1 February 2000 while Low joined as an
                    employee two years later, on 1 March 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Han left soon after because he was unable to put
                    in more capital as required by the other directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> He
                    resigned from his employment in the Company on 30 April 2000, although he
                    remained as a shareholder and director until 30 June 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Han sold
                    his 20% shareholding to Lim and Tiong equally for the net sum of $3,000, which
                    was followed by a series of adjustment top-ups by the remaining
                        shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> After these adjustments, Lim and Tiong
                    had 33% shareholding each and Low had 34%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A few years later, Low also resigned from his
                    employment in the Company on or about 31 January 2004, apparently because he was
                    unable to financially contribute to the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Low accepted the offer price of $1.20
                    per share for his 34% shareholding and resigned as director in or around October
                    2004. On 7 October 2004, he sold his shares to Lim, Tiong and two employees of
                    the Company, namely Corrine and Kong Chong Hin
                        (“Kong”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> After the departures of
                    Han and Low, the resulting share allocation of the Company was as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Tiong and Corrine had assumed that Corrine and
                    Kong would be appointed directors after they became members in the
                        Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> However,
                    they were not appointed as a result of Lim’s objections.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Therefore Tiong and Lim ended up as the only
                    directors in the Company from 2004 to 29 May 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Additional Role and the restructuring of the Company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       From around 1999, Lim also had the additional
                    role of dealing with matters relating to administrative, human resource and
                    financial matters of the Company (“the Additional Role”). This was
                    a demanding job, and in April 2005, Lim asked Tiong by email that the Additional
                    Role be rotated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It was subsequently agreed that Lim and
                    Tiong would take turns every five years being responsible for the Additional
                        Role.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                    This led to a disagreement as to whether Tiong should be given additional
                    remuneration for the Additional Role, and whether Lim had been receiving
                    additional income for the aforesaid role. In the end, it was agreed that Tiong
                    would not receive extra pay for his new duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At around the same time, in May 2005, Tiong
                    suggested to Lim that the Company’s business operation be divided into two
                    teams that each deal with the company’s main lines of business, namely,
                    software products and outsourcing services. Lim agreed. Lim would head the
                    outsourcing services division (“Outsourcing Services”) and Tiong
                    would head the software products division (“Software Products”) as
                    the business managers of their respective teams.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sometime in or about December 2005, Lim and
                    Tiong verbally agreed on the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     that 20% of the profit before tax
                        from each division would be allocated to that division, for the payment of
                        sales commission and bonus to the employees of that division;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the
                        balance 80% of the profit before tax would go to the Company’s general
                        funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It was common ground that the two divisions
                    were largely autonomous. Tiong and Lim were responsible for the business sales
                    and technical support within each division. Nevertheless, Tiong and Lim
                    consulted each other on issues relating to the management of the
                        Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The termination of the Philips Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Everything was smooth sailing when both
                    divisions were contributing to the Company’s bottom line. This changed on
                    30 June 2011 when Philips Electronics Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Philips”) terminated its outsourcing contract with the Company
                    (“the Philips Contract”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> At that point, the Philips
                    Contract was the main, if not the only, source of revenue for Outsourcing
                        Services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> All staff employed to manage the
                    Philips Contract were subsequently let go.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Software Products,
                    meanwhile, remained profitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Tiong blamed Lim for not finding other clients
                    to reduce his division’s dependence on Philips, especially when Philips
                    had indicated in 2009 that the contract was likely to be terminated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Lim, on
                    the other hand, claimed that he did his best under the circumstances but was
                    unable to find other clients, given the competitive market for outsourcing
                    services which was increasingly being dominated by larger multinational
                        corporations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Lim
                    claimed that he had already done well to prolong the Philips Contract for as
                    long as he did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 28 September 2011, Tiong asked Lim for
                    Lim’s business development plan and whether there would be incoming
                    revenue from October to December 2011. Lim replied with a rather bare outline,
                    and did not respond when Tiong returned with further questions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 24 October 2011, Lim emailed Tiong to ask
                    Tiong to hand over the Additional Role to Lim as the agreed term of five years
                    was over. In an email on 14 November 2011, Tiong essentially declined to decide
                    on the matter of the Additional Role and instead asked Lim to justify his
                    position as a business manager, when his division was no longer generating any
                        revenue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lim admitted that he was asking for his

                    his marketing efforts to find alternative sources of revenue after the loss of
                    the Philips Contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Whether Lim was at fault for
                    failing to find other clients, or whether the Philips Contract could have been
                    further prolonged, was a commercial question on which I would not express a
                    view. However, it was clear that after the loss of the Philips Contract, Lim was
                    no longer pulling his weight financially. Tiong’s division, on the other
                    hand, was successful in expanding its business from one year to the
                next.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At Lim’s request, a meeting of the
                    Company’s board of directors was convened on 14 November 2011. This was a
                    meeting between Tiong and Lim, being the Company’s only directors at the
                    time. Corrine recorded the minutes and it was clear from the minutes that Tiong
                    had no intention of handing over the Additional Role to Lim, on the basis that
                    the Additional Role should have been rotated 15 months before the board of
                    directors meeting. Tiong also expressed his view that Lim’s business plan
                    was not viable, and mentioned that Lim’s own salary and allowances cost
                    more than the forecasted revenue of $27,590 till end of December
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 23 November 2011, Tiong told Lim at the
                    void deck of Tiong’s flat that he no longer wished to have a business
                    relationship with Lim. This was after Lim informed him he could not come up with
                    a better business plan by 25 November 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proposed share buyout </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Soon after, Lim and Tiong agreed that Lim
                    should exit the Company. After some negotiations, the terms of a proposed share
                    buyout were finalised at the extraordinary general meeting on 6 December 2011.
                    The terms of the agreement reached (“the 6 December 2011

                        accordance with past practice that had been agreed by Lim and

                        distributed after the audited financial statements for financial year ending
                        31 December 2011 (“FY 2011”) were made available before June

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_g"></a>(g)     After the sale of his shares to Tiong, Lim would resign as a director

                        employment was served on Lim at the end of the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 21 December 2011, Lim received $328,956.75

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Deferred Income issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In March 2012, Lim reviewed the draft
                    financial statements for FY 2011 (which had been prepared by the auditor on the
                    instructions of Tiong and Corrine) and noticed that there was a major departure
                    from past practice in computing the profit before tax. Instead of using the full
                    earned sales revenue for FY 2011 to calculate the Retained Earnings, a certain
                    sum of the Company’s sales revenue was classified as “deferred
                    income” (“the Deferred Income”) instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> There was
                    no deferred income component in the past.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The implication of this change in accounting
                    was apparent. This would decrease the potential dividend to be paid out as part
                    of the distribution of Retained Earnings under the 6 December 2011 Agreement.
                    Unsurprisingly, Lim did not see why the accounts were prepared in this way and
                    sought to ensure that the deferred income component was not a cent more than it
                    would have to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Deferred Income was initially assessed to
                    be $427,038, but after discussions with the Company’s auditor, Lim
                    eventually managed to reduce the Deferred Income figure to $396,312.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                    Ultimately, without the Deferred Income, the Retained Earnings amounted to
                        $123,939.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> If one added the Deferred Income to the
                    Retained Earnings, the total profit up for distribution would have been $520,251
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendants accepted that the change to the
                    Company’s accounting practice (which was allegedly initiated by
                        Corrine<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>) took place <em>because</em> of the 6 December 2011 Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Only the <em>motive</em> was in issue. The defendants’ position was
                    that the decision to exclude the Deferred Income was to
                    “facilitate” the term of the 6 December 2011 Agreement that
                    related to the distribution of the Retained Earnings, as the new accounting
                    treatment would reflect more accurately the retained earnings of the Company as
                    at the specific date of 31 December 2011. Lim had been given “full
                    opportunity to review, adjust, and object to the draft financial
                    statements” and he had signed off on the finalised FY 2011 audited
                    financial statements without listing out any objections.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Corrine’s testimony was essentially that
                    she had uncovered three invoices where money had been paid to the Company in
                    2011 for work to be done in 2012. She then raised this to Tiong, as she wanted
                    to ensure that the Retained Earnings would accurately reflect the value of the
                    Company as at 31 December 2011 because of the impending share transfer. Tiong
                    directed her to inquire with the Company’s auditors, which then led to the
                    uncovering of the alleged mistake in how the Company’s financial
                    statements were prepared in the past.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> However,
                    it became apparent during cross-examination that Corrine knew very little about
                    accounting. It was highly unlikely that she would have been able to spot an
                    accounting mistake by herself, or that she would have been able to inform Tiong
                    that the “net tangible asset” method of calculating the
                    Company’s accounts would most accurately reflect the Company’s value
                    as at 31 December 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> For these reasons, I found Corrine’s
                    evidence quite unbelievable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I noted that earlier in 2008, there had been a
                    distribution of the Company’s retained earnings as at 31 December 2007 to
                    the Company’s shareholders at the time (namely, Tiong, Lim, Kong and
                        Corrine).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> This distribution was made in
                    anticipation of the entry of a potential new shareholder, one Gan Khuat Giap
                    (although the contemplated share transfer did not eventually materialise). At
                    the time, the issue of deferred earnings did not even come into
                        play.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The defendants tried to explain this away by
                    saying that in 2008, there was no concern of having the net tangible assets of
                    the Company determined as at a specific date.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> I did not think that was a good
                    excuse. First, there was no indication under the 6 December 2011 Agreement that
                    the Company should be assessed on a net tangible assets basis. Second, the
                    original proposal to distribute the accumulated profit as at 31 December 2007
                    clearly had a stipulated end date. Third, both the pay out in 2008 and the
                    proposed pay out in 2012 were to be made because of anticipated changes in
                    shareholding in the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Finally, there was also the fact that Tiong
                    had included the Deferred Income in determining the bonus that would be paid out
                    to himself and his team in January 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> In an email dated 16 April 2012, Lim
                    asked for a revision of the bonus based on the adjustments to the FY 2011
                    financial statements and for the bonuses paid out to be recovered. However, this
                    request was rejected by Tiong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> While I agreed with the
                    defendants’ submission that Tiong’s payout accorded with past
                        practice,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> that was not the point. It was
                    unfair and inconsistent for Tiong and Corrine to change the way retained
                    earnings were calculated and yet insist on past practice to enjoy a higher share
                    of bonuses, which would also have the effect of also reducing the dividend that
                    would be paid out to Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Therefore, it seemed likely to me that when
                    the parties entered into the 6 December 2011 Agreement, it must have been on the
                    assumption that any distribution would be based on the Company’s
                    longstanding accounting practice. They could hardly have contemplated otherwise,
                    because Lim, Tiong and Corrine had no familiarity with the accounting concept of
                    deferred income in the first place. While Lim did sign off on the FY 2011
                    financial statements, it only indicated that he accepted that there was nothing
                    wrong with it from an accounting standpoint,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    Deferred Income issue was really an internal issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Corrine herself was aware that Lim was not
                    happy with the change.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the above reasons, I preferred Lim’s
                    assertion that Tiong and Corrine’s true motive in adopting a different
                    accounting method was to reduce the pay-out that should have gone to
                        Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> To be clear, I
                    am not saying that the defendants were wrong from an accounting perspective to
                    change the accounting treatment, and I express no view on the correct accounting
                    treatment. All I am saying is that the real aim of the changes was to ensure
                    that Lim got less under the 6 December 2011 Agreement than what the parties had
                    initially contemplated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The FY 2011 Annual General Meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The 6 December 2011 Agreement was to be
                    effected at the Company’s FY 2011 Annual General Meeting (“FY 2011
                    AGM”). The Notice of AGM was dated 15 May 2012. Interestingly, although
                    the 6 December 2011 Agreement stipulated that the distribution of the Retained
                    Earnings would take place before the transfer of Lim’s shares, the agenda
                    was arranged such that the distribution would only be effected subsequent to the
                        transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the past, all of the Company’s
                    previous AGMs had been “paper” AGMs, in the sense that the minutes
                    of the AGMs were pre-prepared, and the signing of the AGM papers were just a
                    formality, as the matters within were already pre-agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> The FY 2011 AGM
                    would be the Company’s <em>first</em>
                    “physical” AGM, as opposed to a “paper”
                        AGM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> However, Lim decided he would not
                    attend the FY 2011 AGM. Instead, he asked his sister-in-law, Kuek Chiew Hia
                    (“Kuek”), to go as his proxy because he was feeling down and she
                    had much corporate experience, so he hoped that she could settle the issues with
                    the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> This was the first time any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Like in previous years, a set of pre-prepared
                    minutes for the AGM and the relevant documents to be executed to the AGM was
                    sent to all shareholders, including Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> However,
                    Kuek (who was not familiar with the Company’s practice at the time) was
                    concerned about signing such pre-prepared documents before the meeting and
                    informed Lim that they should not sign such pre-prepared documents in advance of

                    Lim’s insistence on the physical AGM and sending Kuek as a proxy was
                    because of Kuek’s advice or not, his going by the book clearly indicated
                    that the trust between Lim and Tiong was breaking down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The FY 2011 AGM was held on 29 May 2012.
                    Besides Lim, Kong was also absent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> After the
                    adoption of the FY 2011 financial statements and certain miscellaneous matters,
                    the next key issue raised at the FY 2011 AGM was Lim’s transfer of shares
                    to Tiong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> In an email dated 30 April 2012 to
                    Tiong and Corrine, Lim had asked for the payment for the shares to be by cash or
                    by online transfer. Tiong replied on 11 May 2012 saying that he would only pay
                    by cheque.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Nevertheless, Lim instructed Kuek to only
                    accept payment for the share transfer in cash or through online bank
                        transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Tiong, however, wanted to pay with a
                    cheque of $45,000, for the reason that he had already told Lim he would not be
                    able to pay by cash, and his bank imposed a $5,000 limit for online
                        transfers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As neither party would relent, it was mutually
                    agreed that the 6 December 2011 Agreement would be voided.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Tiong alleged
                    that the share transfer form had not been signed by Lim, indicating that Lim had
                    no intention of going through the share transaction at FY 2011 AGM. There was no
                    concrete evidence of the share transfer form being unsigned. Nevertheless, it
                    seemed to me that Lim clearly did not want to carry out the 6 December 2011
                    Agreement any more, after the unilateral changes Tiong and Corrine had made to
                    the Company’s accounting practice. Since the 6 December 2011 Agreement was
                    voided, Kuek also stated that Lim was not resigning as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The next item on the agenda involved the
                    re-election of retired directors, pursuant to the rotation system under Arts 74
                    and 75 of the Company’s Articles of Association (“the
                        Articles”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> In the past, such a re-election was merely
                    a formality, because there was a long-standing expectation that when a director
                    retired, he would be re-elected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Tiong was retired and put up for re-election
                    first. Lim had given Kuek no instructions as to whether she should vote for or
                    against Tiong’s re-election. Kuek (as Lim’s proxy) chose to vote
                    against, basically because she did not think Tiong had been acting
                        properly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> In other words, Lim and Kuek’s
                    trust in Tiong was broken. Nevertheless, Tiong was re-elected because Tiong and
                    Corrine both voted in his favour, and their combined 50% vote prevailed over
                    Lim’s 45%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     What happened next was controversial. Unlike
                    Tiong, Lim was <em>not</em> due for retirement according to
                    the Articles. During cross-examination, Tiong said it was Kuek, as Lim’s
                    proxy, who tabled Lim’s retirement. However, Corrine’s evidence
                    during cross-examination was that the person who retired all the directors was
                    the Chairman of the meeting (namely, Tiong<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>). She clarified during re-examination
                    she was merely under such an <em>impression</em> because
                    Kuek had said Lim was not resigning and she wanted to put him up for
                    re-election. The defendants’ submission was therefore that Kuek had
                        <em>impliedly</em> retired Lim by putting Lim up for
                        re-election.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It seemed to me that during the FY 2011 AGM,
                    no one knew who was supposed to retire. In fact, the Articles provide for
                    directors to take turns to retire, so that Tiong and Lim would not have been
                    required to retire at the same AGM. However, no one referred to the Articles, or
                    to previous AGMs, in order to determine who was supposed to retire. I think they
                    must have assumed (wrongly, it now transpires) that all directors were to retire
                    and face re-election. The fact that Lim was wrongly retired was not uncovered
                    until Tiong was cross-examined on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is unclear what really occurred at the FY
                    2011 AGM, although there is some indication it was Tiong who first raised the
                    issue of retiring Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Whatever the case, I do not
                    think it can be said that it was Kuek who retired Lim. Kuek’s request for
                    a re-election must have been predicated on the fact that she already believed
                    that Lim was due for retirement. If Lim did not want to resign, why would Kuek
                    go out of her way to retire him? As it turned out, unsurprisingly, Lim was not
                    re-elected as Tiong and Corrine voted against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> With their 50% vote, Tiong and
                    Corrine also appointed Corrine as a new director despite Kuek’s
                        opposition<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> and the result was that the Tiong and Corrine
                    became the only directors of the Company. I also note that although Lim had not
                    resigned as a director, he nevertheless lost that position at the FY 2011
                    AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The next item on the agenda was the
                    distribution of the Retained Earnings. Kuek voted for the distribution but Tiong
                    and Corrine’s combined vote against the motion again prevailed. Tiong said
                    he voted against the dividend payout despite the prior agreement because the
                    money was to be used to expand the Company’s business (“the
                    Business Expansion Plan”). This was the first time that the shareholders,
                    including Corrine, had heard of such a plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Kuek then requested
                    an EGM on 12 June 2012 (“the 12 June 2012 EGM”) to discuss the
                    Business Expansion Plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 12 June 2012 EGM</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The 12 June 2012 EGM took place as agreed. Lim
                    sent a friend, Ng Kin Yuen (“Ng”), as his proxy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> There was
                    active discussion regarding the Business Expansion Plan, although Ng felt that
                    the answers to his queries were “not sufficient”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The parties disagreed on what actually
                    occurred at the 12 June 2012 EGM, as well as Lim’s motives. Tiong’s
                    position was that Ng kept asking questions about the Company’s non-payment
                    of the Company’s retained earnings, among other things. The defendants
                    averred that Lim and Ng’s real aim was to pressure the Company into
                    releasing the Retained Earnings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> In contrast, Lim asserted that any
                    discussion in that respect was only a small portion of the overall meeting, and
                    that was relevant to the Business Expansion Plan. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> In the
                    end, Ng (as Lim’s proxy) voted against the Business Expansion Plan, but
                    Tiong and Corrine’s combined votes pushed through the Business Expansion
                        Plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 20 June 2012, Kuek and Ng went to the
                    Company’s office to hand over to the defendants two email printouts
                    requesting for the minutes of the 12 June 2012 EGM. Some unpleasantness occurred
                    (although it did not result in a fight) and there was some finger pointing as to
                    who was the cause. In any event, it was not disputed that, after giving them the
                    printouts and acknowledging receipt of those, Tiong told Kuek and Ng to leave.
                    Tiong also told his staff not to open the door to the office to them, before he
                        left.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In any event, the defendants’ solicitors
                    only sent the minutes in a letter dated 22 August 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>This was only done after repeated requests sent by Kuek’s
                    solicitors, and only after the defendant’s solicitors had asked for
                    payment of $13 for a copy of the minutes (at $1 per page).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> This
                    was a departure from past practice when shareholders were sent the minutes free
                    of charge not long after the meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> It was evident to me that Lim felt
                    humiliated that he had to pay $13 and it was a loss of status and pride for
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On 26 September 2012, Kuek’s solicitors
                    wrote to the defendants’ solicitors with some comments and notes made on
                    behalf of Lim. The defendants’ solicitors replied on 3 October 2012
                    dismissing the comments, stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    the Plaintiff was not entitled to the alteration of the Company’s minutes
                    of meetings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> By this time, it was known that Lim had
                    granted Kuek a Power of Attorney to Kuek over all matters relating to
                    Lim’s shareholding in the Company, as Kuek’s solicitors had
                    communicated this to the defendants on 5 July 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While this was going on, Tiong bought
                    Kong’s 5% stake in the company on 21 June 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> This
                    brought Tiong’s shareholding to 50%, with Corrine holding 5% and Lim with
                    45%. As directors, Tiong and Corrine approved the transfer. Under Art 24 of the
                    Articles, the Company’s directors may decline to register any transfer of
                    shares to a person they do not approve.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Neither Lim nor Kuek were
                    informed of the transfer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> Tiong’s reason was that
                    there was no need for Lim to approve the transfer since he was no longer a
                        director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There were two other key decisions made,
                    essentially without the Plaintiff’s input or knowledge: the appointment of
                    one Andrew Cheong as a director of the Company on or about November
                        2012;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>
                    as well as an apparent increase in the remuneration and bonuses for the
                    Company’s directors for the year 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The first issue was whether there was
                    “oppression” under s 216 of the Companies Act, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">216. —(1) Any member or holder of a debenture of a company or, in
                        the case of a declared company under Part IX, the Minister may apply to
                        the Court for an order under this section on the ground —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) that the affairs of the company are
                        being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a
                        manner oppressive to one or more of the members or holders of debentures
                        including himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members,
                        shareholders or holders of debentures of the company; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) that some act of the company has been
                        done or is threatened or that some resolution of the members, holders of

                        unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of
                        the members or holders of debentures (including himself).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As stated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<em>Over &amp; Over</em>”)
                    at [81], “the touchstone by which the court determines whether to grant
                    relief under s 216 of the Companies Act” was <em>commercial unfairness</em>. The question is whether there was
                    “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation
                    of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect”
                        (<em>Over &amp; Over</em> at [77], quoting <em>Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</em> [1978] 2 MLJ
                    227).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a quasi-partnership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Before I decided on oppression, I first
                    considered whether the company was a quasi-partnership. In <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at [83], it was noted that courts have
                    “consistently applied a stricter yardstick of scrutiny because of the
                    peculiar vulnerability of minority shareholders” in such a context. The
                    reasons for this are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… First, those who enter into a corporate structure often do not
                        always spell out their rights and obligations in their entirety, in part
                        because they are unable to anticipate all the eventualities that may arise,
                        but also because it would be disproportionately expensive and time-consuming
                        to do so even if they could. Naturally, this problem is particularly acute
                        in respect of those who set up business with others essentially on the basis
                        of mutual trust and confidence - they would have operated on the belief that
                        the majority would take their interests into account and that any such
                        problems would be readily and civilly ironed out. Ironically, often these
                        understandings are not documented, let alone spelt out in legal terms, as it
                        might be perceived that the very documentation of the understanding might
                        betray a lack of trust. This might seem naïve but unfortunately this
                        behaviour is not infrequent, even today, in commercial dealings; <em>relationships thin in words but thick in trust underpinned by
                            the implicit belief that each will do right by the other without the
                            need to spell out in embarrassing detail what is expected or
                            needed</em>. Second, the reality of the nature of a closed company
                        makes it susceptible to exploitative conduct by the majority simply because
                        the minority has no obvious legal remedies spelt out in the memorandum and
                        articles of association. At the risk of stating the obvious, it bears
                        mention that minority shares in private companies are often difficult to
                        dispose of, and even if there was a market for them they would often have to
                        be sold at a substantial discount. [Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendants have raised several factors to
                    rebut the proposition, which are summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The shareholders were not family
                        members, and, the defendants argued, there was no evidence that they were
                        even close friends. The Company was originally formed to enter into a joint
                        venture (which later folded up).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Company had a clear corporate structure
                        where the respective roles of the persons involved were clearly demarcated.
                        For example, Lim had regarded Corrine, a fellow shareholder, as a
                            subordinate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     The shareholders had changed several times over the
                        years, which indicated that the Company’s structure at inception had
                        never held much significance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     Lim and Tiong later divided the
                        Company’s business into two divisions, with one party running each
                        division, with the bonus/commission of each division to be determined by
                        reference to the sales revenue generated by each division. This division
                        more closely resembled two sole proprietors coming together to operate under
                        a shared costs centre, as opposed to a partnership where profits and
                        liabilities are shared between parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_e"></a>(e)     Even if there was a quasi-partnership
                        between Lim and Tiong, to the exclusion of the other Members of the Company,
                        it would be erroneous to apply this to the whole of the Company, and
                        therefore, it was unlikely that the Company had been intended, <em>at incorporation</em>, to operate <em>solely</em> in accordance with the alleged quasi-partnership
                        relationship between Lim and Tiong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In support of their above contentions, the
                    defendants submitted that it is essential for the court to ascertain whether the
                    relationship <em>at the time of incorporation</em> was one
                    based on mutual trust and confidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> The defendants cited <em>Woon’s Corporations Law</em> (Lexis Nexis,
                        2013)(<em>“Woon’s</em>”) in
                    reliance. The relevant passage is found at para 152 of Chapter J of <em>Woon’s</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The single most important factor in establishing the existence of
                        a quasi-partnership company is that <b>it should
                            be an association formed or continued on the basis of a personal
                            relationship, involving mutual confidence</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the term 'quasi-partnership' has acquired a certain degree
                        of legal meaning, what is essential for the court is still to ascertain
                            <b>whether the relationship of the parties at
                            the time of incorporation was one based on mutual trust and
                            confidence</b>. Therefore, courts have used terms like 'company
                        akin/analogous to quasi-partnership' (<em>Chow Kwok
                            Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362) or 'moral
                        partnership' (<em>Wallington v Kokotovich Constructions Pty
                            Ltd</em> [1993] 11 ACLC 1207) to signify the close and
                        personal relationship of the parties and the use of these terms does not
                        necessarily mean that different approaches have been taken in these
                        cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Wilberforce in <em>Ebrahimi v Westbourne
                            Galleries Ltd</em> [1973] AC 360 at 379F has said that
                        the condition would often be fulfilled “where a pre-existing
                        partnership has been converted into a limited company”. <b>However, the presence of some prior relationship between the
                            parties before incorporation is not always necessary to hold that a
                            company is a quasi-partnership</b>. To determine
                        whether a company has been formed on mutual trust and confidence, the recent
                        case of <em>Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvest Holdings
                            Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 776 shows that <b>our courts are willing to take a holistic and broad-based approach and
                            not confine themselves to only looking at the evidence at the inception
                            of the association</b>. This is justified in that it is generally
                        difficult for the plaintiff to prove the existence of some oral or informal
                        understanding at the point of incorporation of the company but the conduct
                        of the parties subsequently and the manner in which the company is being run
                        will often throw light on what has transpired between the parties when the
                        company was first started. The common fear is that judges engaging in a
                        post-hoc analysis may read too much into the evidence before them and impose
                        a relationship which might not have been intended <em>a
                            priori</em> by the parties. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As shown in the passage of <em>Woon</em> above, whether or not the Initial Shareholders were close
                    personal friends or otherwise is not dispositive in the determination of whether
                    the Company was a quasi-partnership on incorporation. It is also clear that the
                    court may legitimately take into account evidence of matters taking place beyond
                    the time of the Company’s inception, although the court should not impose
                    a relationship that the parties had not intended. With the above statements in
                    mind, I find that the Company was a quasi-partnership at incorporation, for the
                    reasons stated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relationship of the Initial Shareholders at the time of
                incorporation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Tiong and Lim had known each other for three
                    years before their business association and Tiong had known Han since 1984
                    through work connections. I agreed with Lim that the fact that the four of them
                    decided to continue to stick together even after the failure of the joint
                    venture for which the Company was formed was also indicative of the mutual trust
                    and confidence the Initial Shareholders had at the material time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A quasi-partnership can have structure and hierarchy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The fact that the Company had a clear
                    corporate structure and hierarchy would not in itself prevent the finding that
                    the Company was a quasi-partnership. Lim rightly conceded that if the Company
                    was governed <em>solely</em> by corporate rules, structures
                    and hierarchy, a quasi-partnership was highly unlikely to be found.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> On the other hand,
                    just as real life partnerships do not have to be (and probably should not be)
                    run in a chaotic or ad-hoc manner, a quasi-partnership can operate in its
                    day-to-day affairs and deal with matters of remuneration in an appropriately
                    structured manner. For the same reasons, the fact that the Company was divided
                    into two divisions was also non-conclusive. In a “true”
                    partnership, partners may have their own specialties, areas of responsibility
                    and their own spheres of autonomy within a firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In a quasi-partnership, what was crucial was
                    the nature of the relationship between the shareholders. The question is whether
                    the shareholders have spelled out their full rights and obligations in the
                    articles of association and any shareholder agreements they may have, and if
                    they did not do so, whether that failure to do was their “implicit belief
                    that each will do right by the other without the need to spell out in
                    embarrassing detail what is expected or needed<em>”</em> (see <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at
                    [83]). Such mutual confidence did not have to extend to the relationships
                    between employees and as between the shareholders and employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Notwithstanding the corporate structure,
                    mutual confidence underlined the relationship between Tiong and Lim. For
                    example, from 2005 to 2011, the bonuses allocated to each business division was
                    determined using figures prepared and set out in a worksheet prepared by Tiong
                    (because he held the Additional Role) and <em>not</em> the
                    figures set out in the Company’s audited statements. I doubt that this
                    practice could survive in the absence of a high degree of mutual trust and
                        confidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the AGMs and board meetings of the
                    Company up until 2012 were really no more than mere formalities. The minutes
                    were pre-prepared, and the retirement and re-election of directors pursuant to
                    the Articles were essentially a pre-determined affair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Tiong himself admitted that he only become
                    very careful about following the Company’s Articles of Association after
                    the FY 2011 AGM, and that he was not “very careful” about
                    following the articles before then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> He only
                    went strictly by the book after mutual trust and confidence had completely
                    broken down on 29 May 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In summary, while the Company was not a
                    classic case of a quasi-partnership, the factors raised by the defendants did
                    not preclude the existence of a quasi-partnership, since all these events could
                    also happen in a real partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the quasi-partnership was only between Lim and
                Tiong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendants had another sting in their
                    tail. They argued that Lim had only submitted that there was a quasi-partnership
                    between Lim and Tiong, which was different from the Company itself being a
                    quasi-partnership <em>vis-à-vis</em> all shareholders.
                    There were other directors and other shareholders (with more shareholdings than
                    Lim and Tiong, like Low). Therefore, it was unlikely that the Company had been
                    intended, at incorporation, to operate solely in accordance with the alleged
                    quasi-partnership relationship between Lim and Tiong (to the exclusion of all
                    other shareholders).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It seemed to me that there was an
                    understanding that all the Initial Shareholders would have the right to
                    participate in the business of the Company from the outset, and this
                    understanding was not only between Lim and Tiong (at least not to the exclusion
                    of the Initial Shareholders). The defendants themselves were under the
                    impression that such an understanding existed. It was Tiong’s and
                    Corrine’s own evidence they had assumed that both Corrine and Kong would
                    be appointed directors when they became shareholders because all previous
                    shareholders of the Company had also been directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> If Tiong and Corrine had assumed that a
                    5% shareholder should automatically have a say, surely it cannot be disputed
                    that the same assumption would extend to a 45% shareholder like Lim. Where the
                    parties differed was the <em>scope</em> of this
                    expectation. Lim’s refusal to agree to Corrine and Kong’s
                    appointments as directors showed that he did not think this understanding
                    extended to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It seemed to me that the implied understanding
                    as of 2004 was that Tiong and Lim would have a say in the management of the
                    Company, but not necessarily minor shareholders like Corrine and Kong. Moreover,
                    the fact that Lim treated Corrine (a fellow shareholder) as a subordinate did
                    not show that the Company was not a quasi-partnership. Even in a real
                    partnership, some partners may be regarded as being more important than others,
                    whether by reason of seniority, competence or otherwise. One might think of a
                    traditional family business where the family patriarch calls the shots. Corrine
                    was not one of the Initial Shareholders, and the understandings that were in
                    place between the founders of the Company at the time of incorporation or after
                    the end of the joint venture might not automatically also apply to
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Such a situation was already contemplated in
                    the classic House of Lords case of <em>Ebrahimi v Westbourne
                        Galleries Ltd and others</em> [1973] AC 360 (“<em>Ebrahimi</em>”), where Lord Wilberforce stated at 361
                    that a quasi-partnership is likely to include one or more of the following
                    elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     an association formed or continued
                        on the basis of a personal relationship, involving mutual
                    confidence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     an
                        agreement, or understanding, that all, <em>or
                        some</em>, of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the
                        business; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     a
                        restriction upon the transfer of the members’ interests in the
                        company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Therefore, the implied understanding was
                    justifiable on the basis that the Lim-Tiong “partnership” was the
                    backbone of the Company. Although the Company was incorporated in 1996, it was
                    only after the dissolution of the joint venture in late 1999 when the Initial
                    Shareholders began devoting their full efforts to building up the business of
                    the Company in earnest. While the Company was more than just an afterthought
                    before that, as there was evidence that the Initial Shareholders did put in
                    efforts to grow the Company,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> it was not
                    the focus of the Initial Shareholders’ efforts until then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Of the Initial Shareholders, only Tiong and
                    Lim stuck it out through the toughest years of the Company. Between 30 April
                    2000 (when Han quit) and 1 March 2002 (when Low joined as an employee), Tiong
                    and Lim were the only shareholder-director-employees in the Company and after
                    2004, they were the only shareholder-directors. They were the key men in
                    building up the Company to where it is today. Therefore, although Corrine, Kong
                    and Tiong had the majority of the votes required to push through the
                    appointments which they all desired, they did not do so in the face of
                    Lim’s objections, whose views were important.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a company that was not a quasi-partnership at inception can
                subsequently acquire that character</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The defendants had asserted that in order for
                    the Company to be a quasi-partnership, it was “essential” for the
                    court to find that the relationship of mutual trust and confidence existed at
                    the time of incorporation. As I have already found that such a relationship
                    among the Initial Shareholders existed at the time of incorporation, there is
                    strictly no need for me to deal with it. But I would make a few
                comments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Reading the passage in <em>Woon</em> cited at [54] above in totality, I do not think that it
                    stands for the proposition that a company that was not a quasi-partnership at
                    the time of incorporation may never become a quasi-partnership. Indeed, in
                        <em>Ebrahimi</em> (see [65] above), it was contemplated
                    that a quasi-partnership may be an association <em>continued</em> on the basis of mutual confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Even though it would be quite unusual for a
                    Company that did not start life as a quasi-partnership to subsequently become
                    one, it was not impossible. This may occur, for example, when the original
                    objects and purposes for which the Company was incorporated had disappeared, and
                    the remaining shareholders decide instead to carry on instead based on new
                    understandings and agreements (in response to the radically changed
                    circumstances), which were never formalised because of the now existing mutual
                    trust and confidence between the shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The UK case of <em>Martin
                        Shepherd v Michael Roy Williamson, Phoenix Contracts (Leicester)
                        Limited</em> [2010] EWHC 2375 (Ch) (“<em>Phoenix
                        Contracts</em>”), which was not cited to me by counsel, is an
                    example of where a court has found that a quasi-partnership arose <em>after</em> the time of inception of the company. I will not
                    go into the facts except to note that it was a case where the plaintiff
                    (“Shepherd”) sued for a fellow shareholder
                    (“Williamson”) to buy out his shares at a fair value under s 994
                    of the UK Companies Act 2006 (Cap 46) (UK). The company in that case had four
                    founder members, including Shepherd and Williamson. One of the four founders,
                    Coley, retired in 1995 and his shares were repurchased by the company for
                    nominal value. The other founder, Walker, was made redundant and resigned as
                    director and his shares were transferred to Shepherd and Williamson for a fixed
                    price as per the company’s articles of association, with Williamson
                    getting an extra share (because Walker had an odd number of shares). The result
                    was that Williamson had one more share than Shepherd. Shepherd did not allege
                    that there was a quasi-partnership <em>prior</em> to
                    Walker’s departure. The learned judge in that case found that, in the
                    circumstances of the case, that there was a quasi-partnership at latest when
                    Williamson and Shepherd became the sole directors and shareholders (at [89] of
                        <em>Phoenix Contracts</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Therefore, even if there was no
                    quasi-partnership at the incorporation of the Company, the Company had likely
                    become one between 2000 and 2004 when Lim and Tiong chose to continue their
                    association after the collapse of the joint venture. The latest time this would
                    have occurred would be after the buyout of Low’s shares in 2004, when it
                    was apparent that the company was run based on what Lim and Tiong agreed between
                    themselves. It was not a case where the directors had to resort to formal rules
                    to resolve issues that would crop up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the quasi-partnership issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     On balance, I find that the Company was a
                    quasi-partnership. However, this was not an essential finding in this case. What
                    is crucial was that the key, unwritten understanding between the parties was
                    that the main shareholders (namely, Lim and Tiong) would always have a say in
                    management. Lim had submitted that he had an implied veto over all key
                    decisions. It was unclear whether the implied understanding went that far, but
                    it was clear that he should at least have a say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     By unjustifiably removing Lim from the board
                    of directors and excluding him from management and decision making altogether,
                    Tiong and Corrine had acted in breach of the implied understanding that Lim
                    would be allowed to participate in such management. To clarify, there was
                    nothing commercially unfair about Tiong wanting Lim to leave because Tiong
                    thought Lim was no longer pulling his weight in the Company <em>per se</em>. However, it was clear to me that the actual exclusion
                    was done in such a way that was commercially unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is trite law that “unfairness does
                    not lie in the exclusion alone but in exclusion without a reasonable
                    offer” (see <em>O'Neill and another v Phillips and
                        others</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1092 (“<em>O’Neill v Phillips</em>”) at 1107). In the present case,
                    a reasonable offer had been made and an agreement reached, <em>ie</em>, the 6 December 2011 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, in breach of Lim’s legitimate
                    expectation that past practices would be adhered to when computing the value of
                    the Company,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Tiong and Corrine drastically and <em>deliberately</em> reduced the actual value of the buyout by
                    making a unilateral change to the Company’s longstanding accounting
                    practice. This was no better than excluding Lim without an offer of a buyout,
                    and arguably worse. In any event, it was clearly commercially
                unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Notwithstanding the above, the defendants have
                    tried to justify the removal of Lim on the grounds that it was Kuek (as
                    Lim’s proxy), who first voted against Tiong’s first re-election.
                    Despite the expectation that directors who retire would be re-elected, they
                    argued that Lim had not instructed Kuek to vote for Tiong, which meant that it
                    was <em>Lim</em> who first breached the implied
                    understanding. Tiong and Corrine had “legitimate reasons” for
                    voting against Lim. Therefore, there was no want of probity on their
                        part.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     This did not justify Tiong and Corrine’s
                    actions. First, while it was true that Kuek did vote against Lim, this was more
                    or less symbolic – it must have been apparent to all that Lim’s 45%
                    vote could not defeat Tiong and Corrine’s combined 50%, as Kong’s 5%
                    vote was out of the picture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Second, the 6 December 2011 Agreement had
                    stipulated that Lim’s sale of shares would only take place after the
                    distribution of the Retained Earnings, and only after that would Lim resign.
                    However, Tiong and Corrine arranged it so that the distribution of the Retained
                    Earnings would only take place after Lim had sold his shares and
                        resigned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> By arranging the agenda in this way, Tiong and
                    Corrine were acting contrary to the 6 December 2011 Agreement, and the fact that
                    Kuek had not expressly objected to the agenda did not change that. More
                    importantly, it was clearly prejudicial since Lim would have been left high and
                    dry if he had sold his shares and resigned <em>before</em>
                    the retained earnings were paid out. I also noted that Tiong’s stated
                    reason (regardless of what he thought) for actually rejecting the distribution
                    of the Retained Earnings was not that the FY 2011 Agreement had been voided, but
                    that the money should be set aside for the Business Expansion Plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span>
                    After what had happened with the change to the Company’s accounting
                    practice, it seemed to me that any fears Lim may have had of another
                    bait-and-switch were well justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Third, I do not think Tiong and
                    Corrine’s stated reasons for voting Lim out were entirely legitimate.
                    Tiong said the reason he voted against Lim was because Kuek had voted against
                    him first. It was an action against Lim straight from Tiong’s
                        heart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span>
                    Corrine said she voted against Lim because she felt that Lim
                    “doesn’t honour his word” and that if Lim had attended the
                    FY 2011 AGM personally, everything might have been settled then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> Considering the unexpected and unilateral
                    change to the Company’s accounting practice was what actually led to the
                    breakdown of mutual trust and confidence, it was not fair for the defendants to
                    insinuate that it was Lim, <em>via</em> Kuek, who fired the
                    first shot. If the 6 December 2011 Agreement had been properly adhered to, Lim
                    should have exited the Company <em>before</em> the issues
                    of retirement and re-election would have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Finally, we should also not lose sight of the
                    fact that <em>Lim should not have been retired as a director in
                        the first place</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     To be clear, I did not find that the
                    defendants have acted unlawfully in the sense that they may have been within
                    their legal rights to exclude Lim from having a say in certain matters after the
                    FY 2011 AGM, because Lim was not a director and not part of the Company’s
                    management. That did not mean that their actions were not commercially unfair.
                    As stated in <em>Over &amp; Over</em> at [85], “a
                    majority shareholder may be within his strict legal rights but the manner in
                    which he exploits his legal rights may call for the court's
                    intervention”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other buyout offers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     As stated above, even if Lim was unfairly
                    excluded from the management of the Company, a finding of oppression would not
                    stand in the face of a reasonable buyout offer (see <em>Lim Chee
                        Twang v Chan Shuk Kuen Helina and others</em> [2010] 2 SLR 209 at
                    [138] and <em>O'Neill v Phillips</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The defendants had made three buyout offers to
                    Lim in 2013, and Lim had made two counter-offers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> The defendants even made an offer to
                    wind up the Company. I do not propose to go into the details of each and every
                    buyout offer, except to say that all three buyout offers involved a payment that
                    would be <em>less</em> than what Lim would have received
                    under the 6 December 2011 Agreement had the Company not changed the accounting
                    practice to exclude the Deferred Income of $396,312.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In <em>Lim Swee Khiang and

                    [97], Judith Prakash J summarised the guidelines set out by Lord Hoffmann in
                        <em>O’Neill v Phillips</em> in determining what
                    would be a reasonable offer as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Hoffmann then set out the guidelines to assist shareholders in
                        determining what would be a reasonable offer. There were five points. First,
                        the offer must be to purchase the shares at a fair value. Second, the value
                        if not agreed, should be determined by a competent expert. Third, the offer
                        should be to have the value determined by the expert as an expert. Fourth,
                        the offer should provide for equality of arms between the parties. Fifth,
                        the question of costs would have to be considered. The offer should take
                        into account the plaintiffs' costs although this need not always be payable
                        by the defendants as in cases where the defendants have not been given a
                        chance to make an offer before the action was launched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The defendants’ offers in 2013 were not
                    reasonable when the context and circumstances of the case were taken into
                    account. It may well be that in a vacuum the defendants’ offers may
                    satisfy Lord Hoffmann’s first criterion, which was an offer at fair value.
                    But taking into account the events leading up to the FY 2011 AGM, I do not think
                    the offers can be regarded as fair. In any event, even if the offers were for
                    fair value, that would only satisfy the first of Lord Hoffmann’s five
                    points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Therefore, I find that there was
                    oppression.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Remedy for oppression</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     All parties were in agreement that a buyout
                    was the most appropriate remedy for oppression, if that was found. The real
                    issue was the price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The defendants’ submission was that, if
                    a buyout were ordered, the valuation should be based on the terms of the 6
                    December 2011 Agreement, <em>ie</em>, it should be based on
                    the net tangible assets of the Company as at 31 December 2011 (as reflected in
                    the audited financial statements for FY 2011). The Deferred Income and the
                    Company’s goodwill would not be included in the exercise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Lim, on the other hand, submitted that the
                    valuation date should be 29 May 2012, <em>ie</em>, the date
                    on which Lim was removed as director and excluded from the Company. This was the
                    date that the oppressive acts first took place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> The valuation of Lim’s

                        Company,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> any deferred income which has accrued and the

                    1 SLR(R) 773 (“<em>Yeo Hung Khiang</em>”) at
                    [72]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the determination of share value need not be in accordance with
                        strict accounting principles. The role of the court was merely to determine
                        a price that is fair and just in the particular circumstances of the case.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Rather than try to determine a market value on
                    Lim’s shares based on an abstract willing seller and willing buyer, as a
                    matter of fairness, we should go back to the implied understanding of the
                    parties. There had been various share transfers over the years, such as when Low
                    and Han exited the Company. It appeared to me that the pricing methodology has
                    not been consistent, so there is no consistent practice to follow. But in each
                    case, the price has been negotiated and an agreement has been
                reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In this case, there was an agreement reached,
                    before it was voided at the 11th hour. I accepted the defendants’
                    submission that going back to the 6 December 2011 Agreement was the fairest way
                    of valuing Lim’s shares. After all, it was Lim who came up with the
                    proposed formula himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I, however, made a few adjustments from the
                    defendants’ proposal. The main adjustment was that the Deferred Income
                        (<em>ie</em>, the deferred income for FY 2011 and not
                    FY 2012) should be included, because it was part of the agreement. Similarly,
                    there will be no money set aside for the Business Expansion Plan, as this was
                    also not part of the 6 December 2011 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Another adjustment was needed because the
                    buyout only occurred at the time of judgment, not in 2012. Lim should get the
                    price that he would have got in 2012, and I will add another 10% to reflect the
                    fact that he would only be getting paid in 2014. It was not appropriate to award
                    interest, since this was not an award of damages (see <em>Yeo
                        Hung Khiang</em> at [41]). But I would exercise my discretion to make
                    an enhancement to the share value to reflect a return that Lim should receive on
                    his investment. As the 6 December 2011 Agreement was intended to be completed in
                    2012, Lim would effectively participate in the profits up to 2011 only. So he
                    will not participate in the 2012 and 2013 profits, and in any case he
                    contributed nothing towards them. There will be no goodwill, nor will we look at
                    future earning potential, as this was never part of the 6 December 2011
                    Agreement. So a 10% uplift to reflect two years of investment returns would
                    be fair to the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I spelled out the above methodology to the
                    parties’ solicitors at the hearing on 7 April 2013. I highlighted to them
                    there were still some issues to be worked out, such as the calculation of the
                    actual price, using this methodology. In addition, I directed counsel to work
                    out the detailed structure of the transaction. For example, the parties could go
                    straight to the buyout, or they could first declare a dividend from retained
                    earnings, followed by a buyout. Essentially, Lim would still get the same
                    amount, but it could be done in different ways, and that was something that I
                    was happy to allow parties to work out. I also asked the parties to consider if
                    they needed the court to appoint an expert to calculate the appropriate figure
                    for them, or whether they could work it out by themselves. Unfortunately, they
                    were unable to agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     At a subsequent hearing on 21 July 2014, the
                    parties informed me that they could not agree on a final figure because in 2013,
                    the Company paid a dividend of $30,000. Lim received 45% of that. The defendants
                    wanted Lim to pay back that dividend, for the purposes of calculating the buyout
                    price and the 10% uplift. It was argued that, under the 6 December 2011
                    Agreement, Lim would have been bought out in May 2012. He would not have
                    received the 2013 dividend. The reason for the 10% uplift is to compensate for
                    the delay in payment. So if Plaintiff can also keep the 2013 dividend, he will
                    be compensated twice over.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In response, Lim’s position was that, in
                    that case, he should have been paid director’s fees for the period from 1
                    January to 29 May 2012, as he was only to resign at the FY2011
                AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     After considering the parties’
                    arguments, I am of the view that the 2013 dividend should be put back for the
                    purposes of calculating the buyout price. I also did not include the
                    directors’ fees for 2012 as part of the buyout price, as it was not part
                    of the 6 December 2011 Agreement. Accordingly, I order that Tiong is to purchase
                    Lim’s shares in the Company at the price of $292,000, which is the
                    defendants’ figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of directors’ duties and just and equitable winding
                up</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Lim also claimed against Tiong and Corrine
                    for breach of directors’ duties. However, even though this was a head of
                    claim, Lim made no submissions on this point save for one line in para 118 of
                    the Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions. I deal with it quite briefly. First,
                    Lim had no standing to bring this claim, and second, even if he did, he has not
                    provided any evidence that Tiong and Corrine were in breach. I would therefore
                    dismiss this part of his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Lim had also asked for a declaration that it
                    is just and equitable to wind up the Company. This was pleaded in the
                    alternative, and since I have already granted Lim a remedy for oppression, there
                    was no need for me to make such a declaration, and I decline to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The main issue was the price of the buyout.
                    While Lim succeeded on the oppression claim, he failed on many of his demands
                    with respect to the terms of the buyout. In addition, the legal costs incurred
                    in this case were disproportionate to the amount at issue. I think parties could
                    have made more efforts to settle, and if they had been more reasonable, the
                    chances of settlement would have been higher. I thus award Lim 70% of his
                    costs.</p>
