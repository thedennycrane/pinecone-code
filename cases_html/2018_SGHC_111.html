In a supporting affidavit, the director of the respondent averred that it had been engaged for a very limited scope of work at the Development, which was the supply and installation of metal roofing, gutter and flashing at five locations, and that none of the defects identified by the appellant were in respect of these works.

As for the costs of the action, both counsel requested that costs be taxed. The AR then ordered the appellant to pay the respondent costs of the action which are to be taxed, if not agreed by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Subsequently, parties were unable to agree on costs and the respondent proceeded to file a bill of costs for taxation before another AR. In this bill, the respondent asked for taxation on an indemnity basis. The appellant objected, noting that the striking out order did not stipulate for costs to be taxed on an indemnity basis. The taxation hearing was adjourned for parties to clarify the basis of the taxation with the AR who heard the striking-out application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 24 October 2017, parties appeared before the AR to submit on the basis for taxation.

As such, she had no jurisdiction to hear further arguments as she did on 24 October 2017, and no jurisdiction to make further cost orders.

Whilst the court is usually <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio</span> upon the order being perfected, the present case had several distinguishing factors, notably that the basis of costs was not argued as the OTS issue was not raised at the 17 July 2017 hearing. Further, the correspondence between the parties prior to the 17 July 2017 suggest that there was an understanding for costs to be dealt with by agreement or at a taxation, and as such it would be unfair to deprive the respondent of the chance to raise the issue of the OTS at a later juncture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As for the validity of the OTS itself, the AR was of the view that where a claim was struck out even before it reached trial, this was clearly an even less favourable result to the appellant than if the case had been dismissed after trial. The OTS was also a genuine and serious offer, in that accepting it would have given the appellant the benefit of obtaining costs. Whilst this was a benefit inherent in all offers to settle, in the context of this case such a benefit sufficed. The AR also found that O 22A r 10 of the ROC was not breached, since the tortious claims were phrased in a language that suggested they were separate claims, and it was not otherwise evident from the face of the pleadings that the claims against the defendants were joint and several. Lastly, as the discretion to alter the cost consequences of O 22A r 9 of the ROC was a narrow one such as to preserve the utility of the OTS regime, the existence of concurrent negotiations was not sufficient reason to exercise that discretion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the AR functus officio?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It was not disputed that as a matter of general principle and policy, a court is <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio</span> and can no longer hear further arguments on an issue after a court order has been perfected. Hence, the key issue that remained for determination was whether the specific circumstances of the case were such that this general position could be departed from. In particular, the respondent argued that it was under the impression, due to a letter sent by the appellant on 14 July 2017 (“the 14 July letter”), that neither party would raise the issue of costs of the main action at the 17 July 2017 hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The 14 July letter formed part of a series of correspondence between the parties as to whether discontinuance of the appellant’s claim against the respondent would amount to an acceptance of the OTS. After re-iterating its position in this letter that the appellant would not be accepting the OTS but would instead not contest the striking-out application, the appellant went on to say as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We note that you have listed out the various summons for which your client will be claiming costs, which in our view is best left to be dealt with later by way of agreement or at taxation. Matters relating to the costs of the action that your client wishes to claim should be dealt with separately whether by way of agreement between the parties or by way of taxation if there is no agreement. At the Summons we propose that the parties can take directions from the Court on the timelines relating to the determining [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the costs of the action</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I accepted that as the respondent was the party seeking to rely on the OTS to ask the court to depart from the standard basis of taxation, the prudent thing for the respondent to do would have been to bring the OTS to the AR’s attention at the 17 July 2017 hearing. That said, I did not think it was unreasonable for the respondent not to have done so, as it was entitled to rely on the appellant’s representations in the paragraph of the 14 July letter cited above. Read objectively, the appellant had proposed that they should attempt to arrive at a settlement on the costs of the main action and that this be done after the 17 July 2017 hearing. As the parties subsequently failed to reach an agreement on the issue of costs, this meant that the AR could then hear further submissions on costs. In these circumstances, the respondent was entitled to direct the court’s attention to the OTS at this subsequent hearing. It does not behove the appellant to make the representations it did in the 14 July letter and subsequently argue that the respondent should not have acted as it did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As such, I found in the circumstances that the AR was not <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio</span> and rightly held that she had jurisdiction to rule on the issue of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is a striking-out order no less favourable than the terms of the OTS?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In arguing for costs on an indemnity basis, the respondent relied on O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where an offer to settle made by a defendant —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The appellant submitted that an order to strike-out a claim is not a ‘judgment’ at all and certainly not a judgment obtained by the plaintiff. Therefore, the cost implications of O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC could not be triggered. I accept that, on a superficial reading of the provision, O 22A r9(3) only contemplates the situation where a plaintiff obtains a judgment in its favour, and there is no explicit reference to the situation where a plaintiff has its case dismissed. But if that reading were correct, there would be a serious lacuna in the OTS regime as it does not provide for the situation where the plaintiff’s case is dismissed. However, there is greater justification for imposition of indemnity costs against the plaintiff in that situation, where the plaintiff recovers nothing, as opposed to the situation where it recovers less than what the defendant has offered. The superficial reading therefore suffers from a deficit of logic. A similar sentiment was expressed by the court in <span class="font-italic">Merchant Industries (S) Pte Ltd v X-Media Communications Pte Ltd </span>[2001] SGHC 338. The defendant in that case had served an offer under O 22A of the ROC to settle the suit for a certain sum. However, the plaintiff’s claim was eventually dismissed by the court. On the question of costs, the court held that there was greater justification for the same costs consequences to follow. The learned judge said at [149] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">A fortiori, </span>where the Plaintiff does not succeed in his claim at all, the same costs consequences should follow. This was not disputed by the Plaintiffs. I therefore dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim and ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the Defendants costs on the standard basis up to the date of the service of the offer to settle and costs on the indemnity basis thereafter, with such costs to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The OTS regime was instituted to encourage early resolution of actions in court. It was designed to provide a party with an opportunity to promote resolution of the suit at the earliest possible stage by making an offer to the other parties, whether in the form of a sum that the former is prepared to pay or accept, or some other action by one or all parties. The costs provision in O 22A of the ROC has the effect of forcing an offeree to carefully evaluate its case under the peril of a large award in costs against it. A superficial interpretation of O 22A r 9(3) of the ROC, by leaving out the more deserving case where a plaintiff has its case dismissed, is therefore inconsistent with the objective of the OTS regime. In my view, the words “obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle” in O 22A r 9(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC refer not only to a judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the defendant but includes the situation where the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The issue remained however that before an unsuccessful plaintiff is made to pay costs on an indemnity basis, it must be determined whether the outcome obtained by the plaintiff was indeed one that was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS. This issue of ‘favourability’ is made somewhat trickier in circumstances such as these, where the OTS involved essentially a zero-dollar offer or what is sometimes known as a “drop hands” offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Whereas the test of favourability usually rests on the dollar value of what has been awarded (<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Leng v Singapore Airlines Limited and Another </span>[2001] SGHC 51 at [96]), favourability should also be interpreted in context and may depend on the terms of the particular offer (<span class="font-italic">CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Uniquetech Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In any case, any potential problems with comparing the favourability of an outcome with a zero-dollar offer were largely diminished by the fact that the provision in O 22A r 9 of the ROC refers to an outcome “not more favourable” rather than “less favourable” than the terms of the OTS. Hence, it is clear that an outcome in which a plaintiff does not obtain any award is not more favourable than the terms of a zero-dollar offer. In the present case where the claim was struck-out at the pre-trial stage, it was even more obvious that such an outcome was not more favourable than the terms of the OTS. This is especially so since accepting the OTS would have entitled the appellant to some costs, which point I shall turn to shortly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the OTS genuine and serious?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The appellant relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Endurance 1” </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 970 (“<span class="font-italic">The Endurance”</span>) to argue that an offer must be serious and genuine before it will attract the cost consequences of O 22A r 9 of the ROC, and further that such an offer should contain an element that would induce or facilitate settlement (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd and another v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and others  </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 38). It is clear that what constitutes a serious and genuine OTS must depend on the circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and another v PT Bumi International Tankers </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 267<span class="font-italic">)</span>(“<span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel”</span>)<span class="font-italic">, </span>and that the key question to ask is whether the offeror is effectively expecting the other party to capitulate (<span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel </span>at [14], <span class="font-italic">Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 760 at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In this regard, it is worth noting that the court in <span class="font-italic">The Endurance </span>recognised (at [45]) that the general rule that an OTS should contain an element of compromise does not apply to a case where there is no defence of any substance to a liquidated claim. The reason for this, as explained by Morden ACJO in <span class="font-italic">Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molnar Systems Group </span><span class="font-italic">Inc</span> (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 392 and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel</span>, is that where it is clear that a plaintiff will succeed in obtaining judgment, it should not have to forgo part of its claim in order to avail itself of a rule that aims to discourage a defendant from delaying the judicial process. This reasoning could be applied analogously to a case such as the present where it was clear to both parties that the plaintiff had no case, and where it would not be fair to require the defendant to compromise by offering an arbitrary sum just to avail itself of the rule that seeks to bring the matter to an expeditious resolution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Where a party offers what is in the circumstances an unreasonably low sum or even nominal sum, the Court should certainly be alive to the possibility that the offeror is merely seeking to gain a tactical advantage by securing indemnity costs, rather than sincerely seeking to settle the matter without recourse to judicial determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 That said, and in view of the authorities cited above, it is not necessarily the case that a nominal or even zero-dollar offer can never be genuine and serious. In particular, the cost implications of accepting an OTS could suffice in some cases as an inducement to settle. In the present case, the OTS was silent as to the issue of costs, and as such the provisions in O 22A r 9(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC would have been triggered had the appellant accepted the OTS. Order22A r 9(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(2) Where an accepted offer to settle does not provide for costs —  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where the offer was made by the defendant, the plaintiff will be entitled to his costs assessed to the date he was served with the offer, and the defendant will be entitled to his costs from the date 14 days after the date of the service of the offer assessed up to the date that the notice of acceptance was served.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Hence if the appellant had accepted the OTS in this case, it would have been entitled to costs up to 27 June 2016. Faced with the OTS, the sensible thing for the appellant to do would have been to conduct an expeditious evaluation of its claim against the respondent to see if there was good basis to continue, or whether it should accept the OTS with recovery of standard costs against the respondent. By choosing to continue with its claim which it subsequently effectively abandoned, the appellant had involved the respondent in unnecessary costs until the time the claim was struck out. I was of the view that the circumstances in this case were such that the cost benefits sufficed to induce settlement and to render the OTS a genuine and serious one. Indeed, the respondent’s offer was not only genuine and serious, but one might even say generous, as the respondent was offering essentially to pay some costs to the appellant even though the appellant had no case against the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the OTS in breach of O 22A r 10 of the ROC?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 O 22A r 10 of the ROC provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where there are 2 or more defendants, the plaintiff may offer to settle with any defendant and any defendant may offer to settle with the plaintiff, but where the defendants are alleged to be jointly or jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in respect of a claim and rights of contribution or indemnity may exist between the defendants, the cost consequences prescribed by Rule 9 do not apply to an offer to settle unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the case of an offer made to the plaintiff —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the offer is an offer to settle the plaintiff’s claim against all the defendants and to pay the costs of any defendant who does not join in making the offer; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the offer is made by all the defendants and is an offer to settle the claim against all the defendants, and, by the terms of the offer, they are made jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for the whole of the offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Whether or not O 22A r 10 of the ROC is triggered by reason of a defendant’s joint liability is an issue to be determined based on the pleadings, rather than any subsequent findings of fact, since it is for that defendant to determine on the face of the pleadings whether r 10 needs to be complied with in the making of an OTS (<span class="font-italic">Denis </span><span class="font-italic">Matthew Harte v Tan Hun Hoe and Another </span>[2001] SGHC 19)(“<span class="font-italic">Denis</span><span class="font-italic"> Matthew Harte</span>”). In other words, O 22A r 10 is founded upon whether the defendants have been alleged to be jointly or jointly and severally liable and not whether they have been proven to be so (<span class="font-italic">Denis </span><span class="font-italic">Matthew Harte</span> at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As the respondent had served the OTS on 27 June 2016, the relevant set of pleadings was the pre-amendment statement of claim filed on 22 April 2016. It was not seriously disputed that the tortious claims as phrased in the statement of claim did not allege joint or several liability on the part of the defendants, as it was stated that “the Plaintiff brings a claim in tort against the 4th to 6th Defendants respectively for negligence”.

</div> Whereas the reasonableness of a party’s actions could certainly be a relevant consideration when the court exercises its discretion as to costs, I did not think that the existence of concurrent or subsequent negotiations sufficed in the circumstances to displace the default cost implications.
