It sought to enforce that judgment against the second defendant in that suit, Lee Buck Huang (“the Applicant”). On 1 July 2019 the Respondent obtained an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> writ of seizure and sale order (“the Order”) in respect of two properties held by the Applicant and his wife as joint tenants, these being at 72 Tanah Merah Kechil Road (“the Property”) and 82 Tanah Merah Kechil Avenue #09-12 (“the Flat”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Applicant took out Summons No 4299 of 2019 (“SUM 4299”) and Summons No 3977 of 2019 (“SUM 3977”) to resist the Order. In SUM 4299, the Applicant sought to set aside the Order. In SUM 3977, the Applicant sought to stay the execution of the Order pending the decision of SUM 4299. As SUM 4299 and SUM 3977 were heard together, the utility of SUM 3977 was lost and by consent the Applicant withdrew SUM 3977.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The central issue in SUM 4299 was whether the Property and the Flat, both held by the Applicant and his wife as joint tenants, were exigible to a writ of seizure and sale (“WSS”) issued under O 47 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). After hearing parties’ arguments, I allowed the Order to remain and dismissed SUM 4299. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Applicant applied for leave to appeal as he was dissatisfied with my decision. The Respondent consented to the application and I agreed, as the case law regarding the present controversy on whether joint tenancies are exigible to WSSes, which I shall explain below, is in a state of flux. This requires the Court of Appeal to provide guidance and clarity to the legal position on this issue. In the meantime, I shall now provide my grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The first defendant in Suit 1027, FB Industries Pte Ltd (“FB Industries”) was a long-time customer of the Respondent, which is a Belize-incorporated company that supplies elevator parts.

Regardless of which interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>was preferred, the bottom line was that the execution of a WSS had a real effect on the title and interest of the joint tenant.

</div> Tang Hang Wu &amp; Kelvin FK Low, <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s </span><span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</span>”) at para 9.48 states, without citing authority, that “[u]ntil [<span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>], it was accepted that the interest of a joint tenant can be subject to a writ of seizure and sale”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, an appeal to the High Court from the District Court, involved a property in the joint names of a husband and wife that was mortgaged to a bank. The appellant was a creditor of both spouses. The respondent was a creditor of only the husband. First the respondent and then the appellant, a month apart from each other, registered WSSes (against the interests of the husband and both spouses respectively). The couple defaulted on their obligations and the mortgagee bank exercised its power of sale. The court was called upon to decide on the priorities in distribution of the sale proceeds between the appellant and the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Tay JC held that the appellant was entitled to the entire sum of the surplus of sale proceeds, because the WSS taken out by the respondent against only the interest of one joint tenant was invalid and had to be set aside (at [24]). In coming to the view that a joint tenant’s interest in land was <span class="font-italic">not </span>exigible to a WSS, Tay JC reasoned as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The “interest of the judgment debtor” was attachable under a WSS issued in accordance with O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), and this interest had to be a distinct and identifiable one. Similarly, “the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor” which may be sold in execution (s 135(1) of the LTA) had to be distinct and identifiable and could not be a joint interest held with someone not subject to the judgment and the execution: at [15]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A joint tenant had <span class="font-italic">no</span> distinct and identifiable share in land for as long as the joint tenancy subsisted: at [15]. This was because (at [14], citing Assoc Prof Tan Sook Yee in <span class="font-italic">Principles of </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Land Law </span>(1994 Ed) at pp 87–88): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Joint tenancy is that form of co-ownership where each of the co-owners owns the whole interest. There are no shares. As between the joint tenants themselves, they have rights; however, as against the world, they are viewed as one.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, to seize one joint tenant’s interest was to seize also the interest of his co-owners when they were not subject to the judgment which was being enforced. It followed that a WSS could not attach the interest of a joint tenant unless it concomitantly severed the joint tenancy: at [15]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The registration of a WSS did not sever joint tenancy: at [17]–[18]. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) This view accorded with the view in Canada. <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>[1932] 1 DLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (HC)</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> were relied on for the proposition that delivery of a writ of execution to the sheriff did not by itself amount to severance. Tay JC cited (at [19]) the portion of <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (HC) </span>stating: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the delivery of the writ to the sheriff binds the lands from the date of delivery, <span class="font-italic">it does not change the ownership … </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The continuance of the joint tenancy depends on the maintenance of the union of title, interest and possession, and a destruction of any of these unities leads to a severance. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The trend of the authorities is that a mere lien or charge on the land, either by a cotenant or by operation of law, is not sufficient to sever the joint tenancy; there must be something that amounts to an alienation of title.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) It would create a “fine mess” if a WSS when registered severed a joint tenancy, because of the various possible contingencies that could occur. These included the postponement or abandonment of the sale because of the sale of any other property of the judgment debtor (O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC), the appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits (O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)), the withdrawal of the WSS (O 47 r 9) or the cancellation of the WSS due to its lapse or withdrawal (ss 134 and 136 of the LTA). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Instead of executing a WSS, a judgment creditor could proceed against a judgment debtor who was a joint tenant of land by appointing a receiver by way of equitable execution: at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>, the plaintiff was a creditor of the defendant who was a joint tenant of the property. The defendant was reported missing and became uncontactable. The plaintiff obtained summary judgment against the defendant and, after an unsuccessful attempt at enforcement by way of appointing a receiver (because there was no rent to receive), sought to attach the defendant’s interest in the property under a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Leow JC granted the application. In holding that a joint tenant’s interest in land was<span class="font-italic"> </span>exigible to a WSS, he reasoned as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Preliminarily, Leow JC noted that the requirement that an interest in land had to be “distinct and identifiable” for a WSS to attach to such an interest, and that to be distinct and identifiable a share in the land had to be a separate and undivided one, appeared for the first time in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>. No authority was cited for this proposition. Nor was there any mention of such a requirement in the academic writing that existed at the time of that decision: at [11]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Although a joint tenant did not have an undivided share, his interest was attachable by a WSS because<span class="font-italic"> </span>it<span class="font-italic"> would be converted </span>into an undivided share when the joint tenancy was subsequently severed.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Therefore, severance of a joint tenancy into undivided shares was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a prerequisite for a WSS to be issued against a joint tenancy’s interest in land (at [12]–[13] and [20]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 The concept of joint tenancy is admittedly a somewhat strange legal creation. Every joint tenant in a joint tenancy arrangement is entitled to the whole of the property. This may give the impression that a joint tenant’s share of the property is one that is incapable of being determined. But the plaintiff cites [Tan Sook Yee, “Execution against Co-owned Property” [2000] SJLS 52 (“‘Execution against Co-owned Property’”)] … in this regard to argue that even though a joint tenant does not have an undivided share of the land for as long as the joint tenancy subsists, the joint tenant has an interest in land which is identifiable and capable of being determined. Prof Tan explains (at p 57) that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">this is because the interest of a joint tenant can be converted into undivided shares by alienation, and “for [the] purposes of alienation each is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share</span><span class="font-italic">”</span> (per Dixon J in <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons</span> (1949) 78 CLR 313). When the property is sold for example, the joint tenants will be entitled to the sale proceeds according to their interest in the property and their exact “share” of the property can be grasped. The joint tenants are usually entitled to the proceeds equally unless they are holding the property on trust for themselves as tenants-in-common in undivided and unequal shares, perhaps proportionate to their contribution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 I am of the view that this reasoning is logical and compelling<span class="font-italic">. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In fact, there are many instances before the court in which it has to determine what a joint tenant should be entitled to out of the sale proceeds of a property, based on his interest in the said property</span>. These include applications under s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) … read with para 2 of the First Schedule thereto, which allows a co-owner to apply to the High Court for an order of the sale of the property “where it appears necessary or expedient”. In these cases, the court similarly has to determine how the net sale proceeds should be divided amongst the co-owners after a sale, and very often in the context of joint tenancy arrangements … . This can also happen even after a sale has been ordered, and the court has to declare each joint tenant’s beneficial interest in the property to apportion the sale proceeds … . Thus, if the interest of a joint tenant in land is one that is capable of being alienated and identified, and it is commonly accepted that severance of a joint tenancy will occur when the sheriff sells the land pursuant to a WSS, there is no reason why a WSS cannot be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20  For the purposes of the present case, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the relevant question to be asked when a WSS attaches to an interest in land should not be whether severance of the joint tenancy has occurred or will immediately occur, but whether severance can occur in the future. Given that it is accepted that when a sheriff decides to sell the land under a WSS severance of a joint tenancy will occur if it has not already occurred, and that the interest of a joint tenant can be determined when severance occurs, there is no reason why a WSS cannot be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Regarding the practice in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, Leow JC noted (at [15]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The courts in other jurisdictions proceed on the assumption that an interest of a joint tenant can be taken in execution under a writ of execution over land, and focus on the priority between different creditors, the effect of the registration of a writ of execution on severance, and other related issues instead.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Leow JC agreed with <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>that a WSS did not sever a joint tenancy at the time of registration. He also agreed with <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>for the proposition that the delivery of a writ of execution to the sheriff did not in itself amount to severance: at [9] and [16]. However, he <span class="font-italic">also </span>cited <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>as authority for how the Canadian courts have adopted an intermediate approach – the mere registration of a writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri facias</span> does not sever a joint tenancy, and the judgment debtor must take sufficient steps to execute the judgment against the debtor’s interest in the property. Leow JC considered this a possible approach to take though he left the issue open: at [19].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Leow JC also addressed the alleged prejudice to the non-debtor joint tenant arising from him being “forced” to sell his share of the property upon execution of the WSS (at [21]–[23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 … [I]t should be clarified that when a joint tenant’s interest in the property is seized under a WSS, this has no bearing on another joint tenant’s interest in that same property as <span class="font-italic">the judgment creditor only takes what the judgment debtor is entitled to, and nothing more</span>. In the event of a sale of the property, the sheriff can only market the judgment debtor’s share of the property and has to give notice to the other party prior to doing so.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22  But given that the sheriff may apply to the court for directions under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the [ROC], it is recognised that <span class="font-italic">a sale of the whole property may still be ordered, in spite of the objections of a co-owner of the property</span>. It may seem to some that the “innocent” joint tenant, who does not wish to sell his property, is “forced” to sell his interest in the property. But the risk of unfairness is inherent in any form of co-ownership … and is not confined to the context of WSS of a property held by joint tenants. The situation would be very similar in cases involving the WSS of an immovable property held as tenants-in-common and its subsequent sale. The court even has the power to order the sale of a property in cases which do not involve the enforcement of a judgment debt, even if it means overriding the consent of a co-owner as long as the court deems it “necessary or expedient” to order a sale of the whole property (see s 18(2) read with para 2 of the First Schedule of the SCJA).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 <span class="font-italic">Such “unfairness” is thus not peculiar to a case in which a WSS is registered over a judgment debtor’s interest in a property held in joint tenancy</span>, and courts should hesitate to treat judgment debtors differently based on the type of co-ownership by which their property is held. From the point of view of the judgment creditor, why should he be prejudiced in the enforcement of a judgment debt merely because his debtor is a joint tenant and not a tenant-in-common? <span class="font-italic">The perceived “unfairness” to the co-owner of the property must also be balanced against the “unfairness” to a judgment creditor in a similar case as the one before us</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The appointment of a receiver as an alternative method of enforcement of a judgment debt was unsatisfactory because it only entitled the judgment creditor to rental and profits from the property, which was a very different remedy from the execution of a WSS: at [9]. This method would also be subject to the same problem of particularising the exact interest the judgement creditor was entitled to: at [14]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>, the plaintiff (CLK) and the defendant (CSC) were both judgment creditors of one L. CSC obtained a WSS over L’s interest in a property that L held with her husband as joint tenants. About a month later, the husband gave notice of his intention to sever the joint tenancy and hold the property as a tenant in common with L but did not register that notice of intention. Subsequently, CLK obtained a WSS over L’s interest in the same property. The mortgagee of the property then sold the property. The question arose as to whether CLK or CSC was entitled to the balance sale proceeds. CLK applied to set aside CSC’s WSS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Chua J held that <span class="font-italic">both </span>WSSes should be set aside (at [62]). In so deciding, he reasoned as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) All joint tenants together owned the whole property and had rights <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>, but were seen as one owner as against the world: at [20]. Therefore, seizure of a joint tenant’s interest also meant seizure of his co-owners’ interest. Chua J agreed with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, stating (at [29]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Conceptually, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> … that seizing a joint tenant’s interest also means seizing his co-owners’ interests must be correct, since each joint tenant’s interest in the property is indistinguishable. Each joint tenant holds nothing by himself; he holds the whole estate together with the other joint tenants: Robert Megarry &amp; William Wade, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Real Property</span> (Charles Harpum, Stuart Bridge &amp; Martin Dixon eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2012) at para 13-003. How does a WSS seize such an interest unless the issuance of the WSS itself amounts to a severance? However, it is well established that the issuance of a WSS does not sever the joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He disagreed with Leow JC’s proposition in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span> that although a joint tenant did not have an undivided share, his interest could be seized under a WSS because it <span class="font-italic">would be </span>converted into an undivided share when the joint tenancy was subsequently severed. Chua J gave three reasons in support (at [32]–[34]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32  First, the proposition focuses not on what is being seized when the WSS is issued but on what can be seized <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> upon severance of the joint tenancy. However, upon severance, the joint tenancy ceases to exist as it would have been converted into a tenancy in common. What the WSS seizes when that happens is not the interest of a joint tenant but that of a tenant in common. In my view, the proposition implicitly acknowledges that there is nothing for the WSS to bite onto until the joint tenancy is converted into a tenancy in common. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33  Second, before the court makes an order for a WSS to be issued, it must be satisfied that the interest that is sought to be seized under the WSS is capable of being so seized. If it is not capable of being so seized, the court cannot make the order. It cannot be an answer to say that that interest will subsequently be converted into one which would be capable of being seized. In other words, if the nature of a joint tenant’s interest is such that it cannot be seized under a WSS, it cannot be an answer to say that upon a <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> severance, the joint tenant’s interest will be converted into that of a tenant in common which can be seized under a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34  Third, in any event, the proposition seems to be premised on an ability to sell the <span class="font-italic">property</span> following a seizure of the <span class="font-italic">debtor’s interest</span>. However, the seizure of the debtor’s interest does not allow the sheriff to sell the property in respect of which the debtor is a joint tenant. Seizure of a joint tenant’s interest under a WSS is not the same thing as a seizure of the property itself. Further, it is clear from the earlier discussions (at [21] above) that even assuming that a joint tenant’s interest can be taken in execution under a WSS, the sheriff cannot sell <span class="font-italic">the property</span> without the agreement of all the joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Chua J also disagreed with Leow JC that O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC enabled the court to order a sale of the property against the wishes of the other joint tenants. It only permitted the sheriff to apply to court for directions <span class="font-italic">in connection with the sale of the immovable property</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that provision came into play only where the sheriff had the power to sell the property in the first place: at [36]–[38].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Chua J found that neither the judgment creditor nor the sheriff were entitled to apply for a sale of the property in lieu of partition under s 18(2) of the SCJA read with para 2 of the First Schedule. The rights to apply for partition and to apply for sale in lieu of partition were rights given to co-owners. The WSS did not make the judgment creditor a co-owner and neither did the registration of the WSS. The general property and interest in the property remained with the debtor until execution of the sale: at [39]–[40], citing <span class="font-italic">Chia Kin Tuck</span> at [14].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Chua J had this to say about reliance on the practice in other Commonwealth jurisdictions (at [41]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Leow JC also relied on the practice in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. However, as his Honour noted … these cases proceeded on the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> that a WSS can be executed against a joint tenant’s interest in land, without any discussion. These cases therefore do not assist in the analysis of the issues discussed above. I would add that in Canada, s 9 of the Execution Act, RSO 1990, c E.24, which was first enacted in 1957, expressly permits the seizure and sale of property held in joint tenancy. … Previous Canadian cases had assumed that a joint tenant’s interest can be attached in execution. However, in 1953, the Ontario High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re Tully and Tully and Klotz</span> [1953] 4 DLR 798 cast doubt on this position when it decided, albeit without giving written reasons, that a joint tenant’s interest could not be attached in execution. There was thus at least some degree of uncertainty in Canada on this issue before the legislature intervened and enacted s 9 of the Execution Act.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The mere registration of a WSS over jointly held land did not sever the joint tenancy. The modes of severance were an act of the joint tenant operating on his own share, mutual agreement or a sufficient course of dealing: at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Higgins</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendant in <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>co-owned a property with his wife as joint tenants. He had two sets of judgment creditors: the plaintiff law firm, which acted for him in two lawsuits and now claimed unpaid legal fees; and the counterparty (“X”) in those lawsuits. X filed a WSS over the property sometime between July 2015 (when <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span> was decided) and July 2017 (when <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>was decided). In September 2017, the law firm also applied for a WSS. The sole issue on appeal from the Assistant Registrar was whether a judgment for payment of money was enforceable by way of a WSS against the judgment debtor’s interest in immovable property which was held under a joint tenancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Pang JC dealt with this issue very comprehensively. He also appointed an <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span> to address the legal issues before the court. These were the reasons for his decision: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Historically, English law permitted execution by way of a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>against the interest of a joint tenant (the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>was a statutory creation under which a judgment debtor could take possession of half of the joint debtor’s freehold land). This was supported by <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s </span><span class="font-italic">Case </span>(1607) 77 ER 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s </span><span class="font-italic">Case</span>”), where judgment was obtained by the plaintiff against M (a joint tenant of land). M then released all her estate and right in the land to F, the other joint tenant. The court held that notwithstanding the release, the plaintiff was entitled to execute the judgment by a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. Pang JC observed at [17] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  The issue in [<span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s </span><span class="font-italic">Case</span>] was whether a judgment debtor could defeat execution against her interest as joint tenant by releasing her interest in the land to the other joint tenant. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  The premise underlying this issue must be that the law as it stood in 1595 allowed a joint tenant’s interest in land to be taken in execution of a judgment by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. Had this not been the case, the arguments in [<span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s </span><span class="font-italic">Case</span>] would have included the preliminary issue of whether a joint tenant’s interest in land was exigible to a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>, and not just the issue of whether an execution by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span> could be defeated by the joint tenant releasing her interest in the land before execution.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That approach under English law became part of Singapore law under the Second Charter of Justice in 1826. Though the provisions that tracked the evolution of the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>evolved over the years and Singapore also introduced the Torrens system, there was <span class="font-italic">no intention </span>to<span class="font-italic"> </span>restrict the successors of the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>to a narrower range of interests in land than those previously exigible to the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. That evolution may be summarised as follows: at [21]–[35]. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>was replaced by the “Writ of Execution against Lands” in the Straits Settlements Civil Procedure Ordinance 1878 (Ordinance No 5 of 1878) (“CPO 1878”) and the Straits Settlements Civil Procedure Code 1907 (Ordinance No 31 of 1907) (“CPC 1907”); followed by the “writ of seizure and sale” in the Courts Ordinance 1934 (Ordinance No 17 of 1934) (“Courts Ordinance 1934”) and the Civil Procedure Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 (S 2941/1934) (“RSC 1934”); and finally the WSS in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (Act 24 of 1969). </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Although the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (S 274/1970) (“RSC 1970”) for a time replaced the WSS with charging orders as the mode of execution against immovable property, eventually the WSS was restored as the relevant mode of execution in 1991 via the introduction of O 47 rr 4 and 5, the texts of which remain substantially unchanged to this day.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Singapore adopted the Torrens system of land registration through the enactment of the Land Titles Ordinance 1956 (Ordinance No 21 of 1956) (“LTO 1956”). Section 106(1) of the LTO 1956 provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The interest in registered land which may be sold in execution under a writ is the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of registration of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">The draftsman’s intention in implementing this provision was clear – that provision was meant to import the Australian position that the interest of a joint tenant could be taken under a writ. Pang JC cited (at [35]) the draftsman of the LTO 1956, John Baalman, in <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Torrens System – Being a Commentary on the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956 of the State of Singapore</span> (The Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) (“<span class="font-italic">Baalman’s Commentary</span>”) at p 218:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has been held in Australia that the interest of a joint tenant can be taken under a writ; <span class="font-italic">Registrar-General v Wood</span> (1926) 39 C.L.R. 46.

Even in the other cases which accepted the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in land to execution without discussion, the judges in all likelihood did so not because they had failed to consider the point, but because they (as well as the parties) had considered the point indisputable having regard to the authority of cases such as [<span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s </span><span class="font-italic">Case</span>] … and authoritative texts such as <span class="font-italic">Coke</span><span class="font-italic"> on Littleton</span> and <span class="font-italic">Comyns’ Digest</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The position in the Commonwealth authorities accorded with logic and principle, and there were no local circumstances to warrant Singapore striking out on its own to take a different position from all the other jurisdictions: at [127]–[128].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Regarding the nature of the joint tenancy, Pang JC emphasised that there were “two not altogether compatible aspects of joint tenancy” [original emphasis omitted], at [77]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… Consequently, the court is not compelled to focus only on one aspect (that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but holds nothing by himself) to the exclusion of the other equally valid aspect (that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants). Once both aspects of joint tenancy are given weight to:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(a)  it will no longer appear incompatible with the nature of the joint tenancy to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS; and </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest in land by WSS will also need not be seen as a seizure of the other joint tenant’s interest – while a WSS would prevent the debtor-joint tenant from dealing with his interest, with the consequence that the other joint tenant would not be able to join the debtor-joint tenant in disposing of the whole property together, the other joint tenant remains free to deal with his aliquot share independently of the debtor-joint tenant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Pang JC isolated the crucial factor that rendered a joint tenant’s interest exigible to execution as its severability (at [81]–[82]). He based this reasoning on <span class="font-italic">The Registrar-General of New South Wales v Wood </span>(1926) 39 CLR 46 (“<span class="font-italic">RG v Wood</span>”), which dealt with a tenancy by entireties, which differs from joint tenancy as the former is not severable. A tenancy by entireties was “a form of co-ownership featuring only the first aspect of a joint tenancy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the right of survivorship and the general rule that co-owners must act together when dealing with the property as a whole) but not the second aspect (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, severability of the joint tenancy and the rule that a joint tenant is able to act on his own share without the consent of the other joint tenant)” (<span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> at [79]). The pertinent point from <span class="font-italic">RG v Wood</span> was that if the Married Women’s Property Act 1901 in Australia had modified the tenancy by entireties to take on the characteristics of a joint tenancy, then it could be taken under an execution. If it did not, then it could not so be. Therefore, the difference was that a joint tenancy had something the tenancy by entireties did not – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, severability. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Pang JC considered and distinguished the situation of a joint bank account in <span class="font-italic">One Investment</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [86]–[87]) and decided that the approach to joint bank accounts was inapplicable to joint tenancies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Therefore, he concluded that although he had no difficulty in principle with the notion that the phrase “interest of the judgment debtor” for a WSS in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC referred to an interest which was sufficiently distinct and identifiable to be seized in a meaningful way, a joint tenant’s interest in land “amply satisfie[d] this requirement”: at [141]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Regarding the concern over the sheriff’s ability to sell, Pang JC clarified that there was a distinction between: (a) the saleability of a joint tenant’s <span class="font-italic">interest</span> in the land; and (b) the saleability of the <span class="font-italic">whole property</span>. He was of the view that since the sale of the undivided share of the tenant in common was not controversial, then the sale of the joint tenant’s interest was similarly uncontroversial: at [106]–[116].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Pang JC did not think the arguments on purported “unfairness” to the other joint tenant versus possible “unfairness” to judgment creditors advanced the analysis much: at [120]–[126].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Pang JC held that severance would occur at the time the WSS was registered (at [97]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Interestingly, he relied on <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>to support his view – the same authority that <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span> relied on for the contrary view. He appeared to have interpreted <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA)</span> more narrowly in that “the lesson to be drawn from [<span class="font-italic">Power</span><span class="font-italic"> v Grace (CA)</span>] is that, in order to identify the time of severance, we need to understand what constitutes execution or seizure under Singapore’s statutory framework” (at [95]). That case did not stand for the general proposition that independent of the statutory context, severance under a writ of execution occurs only when the sheriff commences the process of selling the land: at [92]–[97].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The way around the “fine mess” mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> would be to adopt the doctrine of “temporary severance”: at [98]–[105], <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The difficulty with ascertaining the relative shares of joint tenants is mitigated because the default position, unless otherwise established, is that the joint tenants would hold in equal shares in tenancy in common upon severance: at [117]–[119].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee </span>obtained judgment against the defendant and sought to enforce this by way of a WSS over a property that was jointly held by the defendant and her husband.

Nevertheless, it did not affect his analysis: at [27]–[36]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Chan J agreed with Pang JC that “[g]iven the ‘two not altogether compatible aspects of joint tenancy’, the court is not compelled to focus on only one aspect (that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but nothing by himself) to the exclusion of the other equally valid aspect (that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants). Giving weight to both aspects of joint tenancy, it would not be incompatible with the nature of the joint tenancy to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS”: at [48(c)]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Chan J observed that the Commonwealth authorities supported the view that a joint tenant’s interest was exigible to a WSS, though he noted that “it appears that the issue as to whether a WSS can latch onto a joint tenant’s interest in land for the purpose of enforcement did not arise squarely in some of the cases from the Commonwealth jurisdictions considered by Pang JC”: at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The view that a joint tenant’s interest was exigible to a WSS was supported by the draftsman’s intention in <span class="font-italic">Baalman’s Commentary</span>: at [39]–[46]<span class="font-italic">. </span>“The decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, which stipulated at [15] that ‘“the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor’ which may be sold in execution (s 135(1) of LTA) must be distinct and identifiable and cannot be a joint interest” thus directly opposes the draftsman’s intention” (at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Chan J made no finding as to whether a joint tenancy was severed by a subsequent registration of the WSS: at [74]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest to a WSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 After hearing the parties’ arguments, I was inclined to accept the reasoning and the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>, <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Thus,<span class="font-italic"> </span>I was satisfied that the interest of a joint tenant was capable of attachment by an order under O 47 r 4(1) of the ROC and exigible to a WSS.

But the Requirement is not expressly found in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC that deals with WSSes, which provides that the order of court in Form 96 is to attach “the interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property”. Nor is the Requirement found in any other statute on this issue, including s 135(1) of the LTA and s 13 of the SCJA. These relevant statutes merely refer to “interest” and not “distinct and identifiable interest”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>, Leow JC noted that the Requirement appeared for the first time in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>. He did not ground his decision on whether a joint tenant’s interest in land satisfied the Requirement. Instead, he simply held that “severance of a joint tenancy into undivided shares was not a prerequisite for a WSS to be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land” (at [11]). Chua J in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien </span>cited <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and agreed that the Requirement would apply to WSSes (at [24] and [42]). Pang JC in <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>had no difficulty accepting the Requirement in principle and held that a joint tenant’s interest in land “amply satisfied this requirement”: at [141]. Chan J in <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span> appeared to indicate that the Requirement would not apply to WSSes as this was not the intention of the draftsman: at [46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The established and uncontroversial approach to statutory interpretation is that a court should <span class="font-italic">not</span> read into a statute words that are not there, especially when the statute is clear and unambiguous. See <span class="font-italic">Thomson</span><span class="font-italic"> (Pauper) v Goold &amp; Co </span>[1910] AC 409 at 420, “[i]t is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do”; and <span class="font-italic">Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd v Evans </span>[1910] AC 444 at 445, “we are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself”. Similarly, the Singapore court has declined to give a more restrictive meaning to the wording in a statute than the plain wording would suggest: <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Admittedly, the “default” in O 25 r 3(2) (like that in the present case), relates to a default in complying with an order of court, unlike a default under O 13 and O 19 of the ROC which relates to a default in complying with the procedures prescribed in those orders of the ROC. But there is nothing in s 34(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to suggest that the “default judgment” referred to in the provision is limited only to a judgment obtained by default in complying with the procedures prescribed in the ROC and not default in complying with an order of court. <span class="font-italic">We can see no justification to give such a restrictive meaning to the word “default” which means non-compliance with something. To so restrict its meaning would be to read, quite unwarrantably, additional words into the provision, words which are not there.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my view, it was unnecessary for <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>to read the Requirement into O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC as the wording of the provision is clear and unambiguous. Firstly, the qualifying adjectives “distinct and identifiable” are absent from the plain wording of the statute. Secondly, nor is there any indication, from the history of this provision outlined in <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>(see [33(b)] above), that the legislature intended to introduce this qualification at any point. To the contrary, the intention of the draftsman, John Baalman, was not to introduce this restrictive reading. As explained by Pang JC in <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> and Chan J in <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon </span><span class="font-italic">Hwee</span>, the draftsman’s aim was to import the position under the Australian Torrens system of land registration. Under that system the interest of the joint tenant was exigible to a WSS. There was no explicit requirement that the “interest” must be a “distinct and identifiable” one. This further strengthened the case that “interest” in the LTA should not be read as “distinct and identifiable interest”. Thirdly, it is unnecessary to read the Requirement into the ROC because the words “interest of the judgment debtor” under O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are perfectly clear and unambiguous. Those words have long been interpreted as referring to how a judgment creditor may only attach, by way of a WSS (or the WSS’s progenitor), property to which the debtor was <span class="font-italic">beneficially </span>entitled. That is illustrated by the case of <span class="font-italic">Ng Boo Bee v Khaw Joo Choe</span><span class="font-italic">, Khaw Sim Tek and others </span>(1921) 14 SSLR 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Boo Bee</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Boo Bee</span>, a judgment creditor had registered an order of attachment. But by then the debtor had already conveyed the land to third parties who had paid the purchase money and entered into possession, although they had not yet registered their conveyance. The court held that at the date of purported seizure the debtor had no interest to be seized, as the property no longer belonged to the debtor beneficially. The issue was the interpretation of s 619(1) of CPC 1907, which provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">where the property to be seized consists of immoveable property or any interest therein, either in law or at equity, the seizure shall be made by registering … an Order of Court … attaching the interest of the judgment debtor in the property described in the Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Pertinently, s 617(1) elaborated on what kind of property was seizable under a WSS: Lands “belonging to the judgment debtor, or over which, or the profits of which, he has a disposing power, which he may exercise for his own benefit”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Ebden J explained: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The all important question is as to the effect of section 617 of [the CPC 1907] which replaced the old writ of execution by a writ of </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">seizure and sale of all saleable property moveable or immoveable, <span class="font-italic">belonging to the judgment debtor</span>, or over which, or the profits of which, he has a disposing power which he may exercise for his own benefit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There was some comment before us on the application of the words “belonging to” where “real” or immovable property is affected.

</div> The interest in the property was therefore held by a “composite person”, here the Applicant and his wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I did not accept this argument. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span>, there are two perspectives to a joint tenancy: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants <span class="font-italic">but nothing by himself</span> (“the First Aspect”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A joint tenant has a <span class="font-italic">real ownership interest</span> which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants (“the Second Aspect”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Second Aspect works in this way. In a joint tenancy there are no <span class="font-italic">actual</span> shares because each co-owner owns the whole. But the law recognises him as having a <span class="font-italic">notional</span>, <span class="font-italic">aliquot </span>share, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a share that is a potentially rather than actually divided share in property. A joint tenant’s aliquot share is converted into actual, undivided shares in property held as a tenant in common upon severance. That view is shared by the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 9.17:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The cases have proceeded on the fallacy that a joint tenant does not have a distinct and identifiable share prior to severance. This is a false premise. <span class="font-weight-bold">A joint tenant has an </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">aliquot </span><span class="font-weight-bold">share prior to severance. </span>… The presence of an <span class="font-italic">aliquot</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>share explains why a joint tenant may unilaterally alienate his own share to a third party which results in a severance of the joint tenancy. Furthermore, it is uncontroversial that when a joint tenant becomes bankrupt, his share of the joint tenancy passes to the Official Assignee and Public Trustee which thereby causes a severance of the joint tenancy. If the joint tenant does not have a distinct and identifiable share prior to severance, then unilateral alienation and severance upon bankruptcy should not be doctrinally possible. … [emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Considering the above, the question boiled down to this: <span class="font-italic">Which </span><span class="font-italic">of the two aspects of a joint tenancy should the court emphasise</span>, in deciding whether a joint tenant’s interest was exigible to a WSS? This was not a question susceptible to being answered purely by reference to the decided cases, but a normative choice to be made after considering the precedents, principles and practicalities or questions of fairness and comparative prejudice to all the affected parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I held that the Second Aspect should trump the First Aspect, such that a joint tenant should be regarded as having an interest capable of attachment under a WSS, for the following three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Distinguishing a joint tenancy from a tenancy by entireties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Firstly, the tenancy by entireties was a distinct form of co-ownership that existed alongside the joint tenancy and tenancy in common. It differed from a joint tenancy in that it had only the First Aspect (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the right of survivorship and the requirement that co-owners must act together when dealing with the property as a whole). As explained in Oval A Phipps, “Tenancy by Entireties” (1951) 25 Temple Law Quarterly 24 at 25 and 39:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Tenancy by the entireties as it was known to the early common law <span class="font-weight-bold">depended in its characteristics upon the marital-unity concept and the corollary, the husband’s dominance before the law.</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">Management, control, power to alienate</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a joint tenancy each co-owner is empowered—in the absence of express or implied contrary agreement between the parties—to manage, control, and dispose of his undivided share … without interference by his fellow or fellows, and he may alienate his portion at will—thereby creating a tenancy in common between his alienee and the other joint tenant or tenants. <span class="font-weight-bold">But one of tenants by the entireties has no such separate powers as to any part of the principal asset</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">See also “Tenancy by Entireties” (1891) 11 Canadian Law Times 97 at 98:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he reason why the joint estate of husband and wife differs from a joint tenancy is, <span class="font-italic">that the husband and wife are considered in law as one person</span>, and it is all the same as if there had originally been a sole seisin of the land. The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">composite person</span>, so to speak, lives on and is seised of the entirety as long as the survivor of them lives and is seised. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To choose to emphasise the First Aspect of a joint tenancy, as the Applicant urged, would assimilate the effects of a joint tenancy to a tenancy by entireties notwithstanding that they were distinct forms of legal status. Indeed, it was telling that the Applicant’s counsel referred to the interest in the Property being held by the “composite person” of the Applicant and his wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To clarify, the tenancy by entireties is not currently part of Singapore land law. This form of property holding may have been introduced into Singapore via the Second Charter of Justice in 1826, given that it continued to exist in England before 1 January 1926: Kevin Gray &amp; Susan Francis Gray, <span class="font-italic">Elements of Land Law </span>(OUP, 5th Ed, 2009) at para 7.4.110. There is some doubt whether the tenancy by entireties was indeed introduced because the Second Charter of Justice imported English law subject to modification by local customs. Regardless, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Thye and others v Commissioner of Stamp Duties </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 306 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Thye</span>”) at [15], coparcenary and tenancy by entireties ceased to exist in Singapore from 1 August 1886. This date appears to be the date on which the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61) (then known as Ordinance 6 of 1886) came into effect, though the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Thye </span>did not explain its reasoning in this way. The tenancy by entireties has been abolished in England and Australia, amongst other jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, the First Aspect of a joint tenancy would not fit into the Singapore legal framework. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prejudice to the non-debtor joint tenant or the creditor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Secondly, the court’s preference of the Second Aspect over the First Aspect must balance the comparative prejudice that would result to the non-debtor joint tenant and the creditor’s interest who was attempting to execute a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I did not find any of the arguments regarding prejudice to the non-debtor joint tenant persuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It was argued that following <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung Kien</span>, to seize one joint tenant’s interest was to seize also the interest of the innocent co-owners when they were not subject to the judgment which was being enforced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As stated, a joint tenancy has two distinct aspects. If the Second Aspect is emphasised, then what the court order attaches to is the debtor-joint tenant’s aliquot share in the jointly held property. The order would <span class="font-italic">not </span>affect the non-debtor joint tenant’s aliquot share whose interest in the joint tenancy is protected even if there should be a forced sale of the property, depending on the circumstances. Conversely, if the First Aspect is emphasised, there would be seizure of the non-debtor joint tenant’s interest because the joint tenants’ interests in a joint tenancy are one and the same. The question, as I have emphasised at [47], must be <span class="font-italic">why </span>one aspect should be preferred over another. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It was also argued that the non-debtor joint tenant would be “forced” to sell her share of the property upon execution of the WSS (a point noted in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]). However, the non-debtor joint tenant could avoid the sale of the property by buying over the interest of the debtor joint tenant from the creditor or the sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The tangential issue is whether a sheriff can apply to court for directions to sell the property under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) when the non-debtor joint tenant does not consent. If the sheriff cannot, then there is no question of the latter being “forced” to sell. The authorities diverge. <span class="font-italic">Leong</span><span class="font-italic"> Lai Yee </span>at [21]–[22] stated that a sheriff could apply to the court for directions to sell the property despite the non-debtor joint tenant’s objections and the Applicant submitted that it was “arguable at least” that this was the case.

</div> I preferred the view in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>. While a sheriff can usually only sell the debtor’s interest in a jointly held property (see the wording of s 135(1) of the LTA and Forms 83 and 97 of the ROC), <span class="font-italic">if the sheriff applies to court for directions </span>under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) then the court may direct the sale of the entire property. The wording of O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>), which refers to “immovable property or any interest therein seized” is wide enough to cover this, contrary to other provisions of O 47 r 5 such as r 5(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) cited in <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>(which refers only to “the interest of the judgment debtor in any immovable property, seized and sold under the order”). In coming to my view I did not derive much assistance from <span class="font-italic">BYX v BYY </span>[2019] SGHC 237, cited by the Applicant, as that case dealt with whether an execution creditor could sell the property even if a mortgagee did not consent. The applicable provisions there were O 31 r 1 of the ROC and para 2 of the First Schedule to the SCJA, and the parties did not submit on whether these applied to WSSes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 But even if a court has the power to direct a sale despite the non-debtor joint tenant’s protests, that does not mean the non-debtor joint tenant is left unprotected. The Applicant and the Respondent both pointed to ways the non-debtor joint tenant could be protected, even though interpleader proceedings did not apply to immovable property. Both submitted that non-debtor joint tenants could seek a declaration and directions from the court.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Even if a sale did occur, the non-debtor joint tenant would be entitled to part of the sale proceeds. The only question would then be of <span class="font-italic">apportioning </span>their entitlement and that was a <span class="font-italic">practical question </span>of having the necessary evidence. One solution would be to look at the parties’ contributions to the purchase price of the property. It would be open to the debtor joint tenant to furnish the necessary information (about the non-debtor joint tenant’s interest) to the creditor who took out the WSS in examination of judgment debtor proceedings. Another solution would be for the joint tenants to invoke any applicable legal presumptions (such as the presumption of advancement from husband to wife) in support of their case. In this regard, the Applicant’s counsel had submitted, in response to my example at the hearing that the court regularly apportions matrimonial assets held in joint tenancies, that this was only possible because the court was empowered to divide matrimonial assets under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). That submission missed the point I was making – I was aware that the court has the power to divide matrimonial assets under the Women’s Charter. I wanted to illustrate the point that the interests of the spouses who own properties as joint tenants are not indivisible and unidentifiable. Thus, the courts regularly approach the issue, at the stage of <span class="font-italic">apportioning entitlement</span>, by looking at parties’ respective contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the other hand, a creditor of a debtor-joint tenant would potentially be prejudiced if enforcement were stymied merely because his debtor was a joint tenant and not a tenant in common: <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee </span>at [23]. That would be especially egregious if a debtor deliberately converted his property holding to that of a joint tenancy to pre-empt execution. To be fair to creditors, debtors should not be allowed to hide behind a joint tenancy to avoid paying their debts. It is no answer to say that creditors can appoint a receiver as suggested by Tay JC in <span class="font-italic">Malayan </span><span class="font-italic">Banking</span>. The shortcomings of this remedy – the entitlement to rental and profits and not the property itself, as highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span> (see [29(f)] above) – make it a poor substitute for a WSS. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The analogy to joint bank accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Thirdly, even though joint bank accounts cannot be garnished, the reasoning does not apply analogously to jointly held land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Applicant cited <span class="font-italic">One Investment</span>, as well as two old English authorities that both dealt with jointly held bank accounts. In <span class="font-italic">MacDonald v The Tacquah Gold Mines Company </span>(1884) 13 QBD 535, Fry LJ stated that “to enable a judgment creditor to attach a debt due to two persons in order to answer for the debt due to him from the judgment debtor alone … would be altogether contrary to justice” (at 539). This case was endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Hirschorn v Evans</span><span class="font-italic"> (Barclays Bank, Ltd, Garnishees) </span>[1938] 2 KB 801. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 However, these authorities did not assist the Applicant. In <span class="font-italic">One Investment </span>itself, Kannan Ramesh JC (as he then was) pointed out two key reasons why the joint bank account context was not analogous. There was no risk that the judgment debtor could access the assets of the innocent joint tenant (because severance would occur by the time of sale of the property and the sheriff may only market the judgment debtor’s share). There was also a way for joint tenants to monitor and challenge a sale. Conversely, allowing joint accounts to be attached in garnishee proceedings would cause prejudice to third parties (banks) who had no visibility as to the respective contributions of the joint account holders (at [23]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 Putting aside my reservations as to the correctness of [<span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>] … I did not find it to be relevant to my determination. [<span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>] specifically concerned a WSS against immovable property, and the illiquid nature of immovable property means that many of the concerns surrounding the potential prejudice to joint account holders in garnishee proceedings do not arise. <span class="font-italic">There is no risk that the judgment debtor can access the assets of the innocent joint tenant</span>; <span class="font-italic">… the joint tenancy is severed by the time of the sale of the property by the Sheriff and the Sheriff may only market the judgment debtor’s share of the property.</span> Upon such severance, the judgment debtor can no longer deal in the shares of the former joint owners in the property. <span class="font-italic">Further, the notification of parties who may be prejudiced is either inherent or expressly provided for in a WSS against immovable property.</span> Order 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC permits the Sheriff to apply to court for directions and for notice to be given to all parties interested in the property. Thus the sale of jointly-owned property would necessarily be carried out with the notice of all owners.<span class="font-italic"> There is therefore a framework which allows joint tenants to monitor and challenge the sale. No such framework exists in respect of a garnishee order against a joint account.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There are two other reasons why the analogy to the joint bank account is not appropriate: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Joint account holders are protected by banking secrecy under s 47(1) of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) which reads: “Customer information shall not, in any way, be disclosed by a bank in Singapore or any of its officers to any other person except as expressly provided in this Act.” The Banking Act does not allow the holder of a WSS to access the banking information of the non-debtor joint account holder. Hence, the bank is required to protect the banking information of the non-debtor joint account holder. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Applicant did not cite any authorities or literature explaining that joint accounts have the First and Second Aspects identified above in relation to joint tenancies. The two are, therefore, not analogous in this sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Accordingly, the distinction between a joint tenancy and tenancies by entireties, considerations of fairness between non-debtor joint tenants and creditors, as well as the dis-analogy to the joint bank account situation were good reasons to accept the Second Aspect of joint tenancies over the First Aspect. I hence concluded that a joint tenant’s interest could be attached by an order of court and taken in execution of a WSS. I wish to emphasise that in my deliberation I was deeply mindful that the legal position must be fair to all the parties involved, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the creditor, the debtor and particularly the innocent non-debtor joint tenants (in this case, the Applicant’s wife), and other purported equitable interests held by the joint tenants on others’ behalf (such as the Applicant’s sisters, if the allegations were true). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other arguments raised by the Applicant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It remains to deal briefly with two other arguments raised by the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged conceptual difficulties with the right to alienate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Applicant argued that the WSS purported to bite onto the <span class="font-italic">right to alienate</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the right of a debtor joint tenant to give up the relationship of joint tenancy and part ways with his co-owner. But until that right is exercised, the interest is not distinct but bundled with someone else’s. This right was in itself not an interest, and an interest was needed for a WSS to attach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, it was not the <span class="font-italic">right to alienate </span>that the WSS is purported to latch onto, but the joint tenant’s interest in the <span class="font-italic">aliquot share</span>. That aliquot share would not be made into undivided shares until the joint tenant exercised his right to alienate. That point was made clear in <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>at [88]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I am not persuaded that the considerations arising from the nature of the joint tenancy are sufficient to support the conclusion that a joint tenant’s interest in land cannot be seized by WSS. On the contrary, <span class="font-weight-bold">the severability of the joint tenancy and the ability of a joint tenant to alienate his aliquot share</span> (or potential aliquot share) without the consent of the other joint tenants ought, in principle, <span class="font-weight-bold">lead to the result that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any property interest</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> which a debtor-joint tenant is able to alienate on his own </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">should be also saleable in execution by the sheriff</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> on the debtor</span><span class="font-weight-bold">-joint tenant’s behalf. </span>[emphasis added in bold and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reliance on Commonwealth authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Applicant argued that the Singapore cases that decided a joint tenant’s interest was exigible to a WSS, as well as the Commonwealth authorities they relied on, did not explain <span class="font-italic">why </span>they came to this view beyond citing precedents that took this view. The propagation of this proposition, therefore, became a self-fulfilling prophecy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Preliminarily, in so far as the Applicant alleged the cases asserted without explaining why the Second Aspect should be selected, his counsel did the same in asserting why the First Aspect should be preferred. It was a case of the pot calling the kettle black. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In any case, the allegation that the Singapore authorities were indiscriminately and blindly following precedents was unwarranted and unfair.

</div> but these <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">very same cases</span> were those identified by Pang JC as cases that did <span class="font-italic">not</span> merely assume the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in land (<span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Accordingly, I held, in line with <span class="font-italic">Leong Lai Yee</span>, <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span>, that a joint tenant’s interest in land was exigible to a WSS independently of severance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Severance of the joint tenancy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It was relevant to consider when, exactly, a joint tenancy was severed due to my holding that a joint tenant’s interest need not be sufficiently distinct and identifiable at the point of attachment of the court order. In my view, the execution of a WSS did <span class="font-italic">not</span> effect a permanent severance of the joint tenancy. Permanent severance would occur only upon a sale of the joint tenant’s interest by the sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Power v Grace (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I began with <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA)</span>, which the Applicant alleged that <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> had interpreted incorrectly. That case concerned a joint tenancy between a mother and daughter. The plaintiff obtained judgment against the mother and a writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri facias </span>was delivered to the sheriff. The mother died before the sheriff could act under the writ. The sole issue was whether the delivery of the writ to the sheriff constituted “execution” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, seizure). Only if it did not would the daughter, as the surviving joint tenant, take the land discharged of the execution. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that delivery was not execution (or seizure) because the statute clearly distinguished between delivery and execution. The relevant provision stated that a sheriff “to whom a writ of execution against lands is <span class="font-italic">delivered</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for execution</span> may seize and sell thereunder” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. Therefore, mere delivery was not equivalent to seizure. In the words of Grant JA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The filing of the writ of fi. fa. with the sheriff merely gives the right to seize the lands,</span> and until the withdrawal, discharge or expiry of the writ, the lands continue “bound” in that sense. The change which may subsequently be made in “title and interest” is potential only, <span class="font-italic">contingent upon the lands being placed in execution by seizure with a view to sale as by law provided</span>. I am therefore of opinion in the case at bar, that <span class="font-italic">the joint-tenancy was not severed or destroyed by the filing of the writ of fi. fa., in the sheriff</span><span class="font-italic">’s office</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>could not apply directly to the Singapore context, given the different statutory provisions. In this regard I agreed with Pang JC that “the lesson to be drawn from [<span class="font-italic">Power v Grace</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>] is that, in order to identify the time of severance, we need to understand what constitutes execution or seizure under Singapore’s statutory framework” (<span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>at [95]). Beyond this, I did not think <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace (CA) </span>was helpful to my analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No permanent severance on registration of the WSS </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In interpreting O 47 r 4 of the ROC, I found that severance did <span class="font-italic">not</span> occur on registration of the WSS. I agreed with Tay JC in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [17]–[18])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that various complications would arise if the contrary view were taken: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 … A WSS against land is an order of court granted <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> but it is not an order that must necessarily result in a sale. This is reinforced by the use of the words “and thereafter, if necessary, to sell the said interest …” in Form 95E which is the direction to the sheriff/bailiff. The sale may be postponed and subsequently abandoned because of the sale of any other property of the judgment debtor (O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)). There may be an appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits or a receiver and manager of the immovable property “in lieu of sale” (O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)). The WSS may be withdrawn (O 47 r 9). Similarly, registration of the WSS may be cancelled because it has lapsed (s 134 LTA) or has been withdrawn (s 136 LTA).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 Bearing in mind that any of the above contingencies could happen, it would be creating a fine mess to hold that a WSS when registered severs a joint tenancy. What would be the position of the co-owners in relation to each other should the WSS subsequently be withdrawn or its registration lapse? Do they revert to being joint tenants again? If the WSS is renewed or a second or subsequent one issued, do the rights of the co-owners change once again? A further argument against severance is that registration of the WSS (if it were possible to do so) merely prevents transfers of interest by the joint tenant, such that there is no severance of the joint tenancy until the Sheriff transfers the judgment debtor’s interest to another person. In favour of this is the fact that on the register, the judgment debtor remains a joint owner of the property, and in terms of form, maintains the same interest as his co-owner. For these reasons, I hold that registration of the WSS does not sever a joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I observe that if, for instance, a non-debtor joint tenant decides to purchase the “share” of the debtor joint tenant in order to avert a forced sale by the sheriff, there would be no need for the sheriff to sell the property and permanent severance would not occur. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 What, then, is the position between registration of the WSS and sale? <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>proposed the doctrine of “temporary severance”. The key tenets of the doctrine were summarised in <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> as follows (at [99]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The registration of a WSS does not permanently sever the joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Instead, a temporary severance is effected while the WSS remains in force, during which period the four unities of a joint tenancy are suspended. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the WSS lapses or is withdrawn, the four unities are restored and the joint tenancy comes back into existence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Permanent severance occurs only upon an out-and-out sale of the joint tenant’s interest by the sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I accepted that some of the key tenets of the doctrine of temporary suspension or severance would adequately fill the analytical gap in the interim between registration of the WSS and permanent severance upon sale by the sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>proposed that upon eventual severance of the joint tenancy the presumption, absent any evidence to the contrary, should be that the joint tenants held the land in equal shares both at law and in equity (<span class="font-italic">Higgins</span> at [118]). <span class="font-italic">Higgins </span>explained that the presumption was a sensible starting point because no injustice would be caused to any joint tenant; mechanisms existed for interested joint tenants to prove that their beneficial interests were not held in equal shares. But if the concern is that of injustice, it is not necessarily just to start with a presumption, which could work both ways depending on whether the non-debtor joint tenant actually lays claim to more or less than half of the property. Having the presumption may be an easy way to resolve the apportionment but it may, in certain instances, result in unfairness to the non-debtor joint tenant. In the absence of a presumption the court has to find an equitable and fair evaluation to ascertain a just apportionment. The burden is on the creditor or the sheriff to establish on the evidence<span class="font-italic"> </span>the proportion of the debtor’s interest/share in the joint tenancy. If the creditor or the sheriff fails to adduce evidence to apportion or quantify the debtor’s interest in the joint tenancy it may even be that the remedy of forfeiture should not be granted, since the burden of proof has not been discharged notwithstanding that this interest is exigible to the WSS. This issue of apportionment is not directly relevant here and parties have not fully argued on it. I shall leave it for another occasion where this issue takes centre stage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Applicant’s allegations that he, his wife and his sisters had contributed financially to the Property </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Applicant further alleged that there was a common intention constructive trust and/or presumption of resulting trust in the Property. This is because the Applicant alleged that he, his wife and two sisters had financially contributed towards the purchase of the Property notwithstanding that the Property was registered only in the names of the Applicant and his wife as joint tenants. As a result of this allegation, the Applicant sought prayer 2 in SUM 4299, which requires the court to make a declaration that the beneficial owners of the Property are the Applicant, his wife and two sisters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Respondent argued that such an argument was self-defeating <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the main relief. If the Applicant is arguing for a common intention constructive trust or resulting trust, then even if the court finds for the Applicant on the main issue (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, finds that a joint tenant’s interest is not exigible to a WSS), such a trust means the joint tenancy has been severed in equity into an implied tenancy in common in unequal shares proportioned to the amount of the purchase price contributed by each co-owner. Therefore, the Applicant’s distinct share <span class="font-italic">in the </span><span class="font-italic">tenancy in common</span> remained exigible.

The certificate of title from the Land Registry under the Torrens system was conclusive evidence that the Applicant and his wife are joint tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As I have mentioned above at [11], the Applicant, at the hearing of SUM 4299, withdrew prayer 2. Be that as it may, I shall give my views on this matter regarding severance and apportionment of interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The Respondent was correct insofar as the presumption of resulting trust may arise due to parties’ unequal contributions to the purchase price, to affect the proportion of their entitlement<span class="font-italic"> </span>to the proceeds. However, that issue of apportionment becomes relevant only when there is severance (see “Execution against Co-owned Property” at 57, set out immediately below), and as I have held, permanent severance would occur only upon a sale of the joint tenant’s interest by the sheriff: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [S]everance into undivided shares is not a prerequisite for the issuance of a writ of seizure and sale against a joint tenant's interest. He has an interest, which can be converted into an undivided share by alienation, and “for the purposes of alienation each is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share”. The judgment creditor however does have to state clearly that he is only taking the interest to which the joint tenant is entitled. <span class="font-italic">Although a joint tenant does not have an undivided share, yet </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">when the property is sold</span><span class="font-italic">, the erstwhile</span><span class="font-italic"> joint tenants will be entitled to the proceeds equally unless they were holding in trust for themselves as tenants in common in undivided and unequal shares</span>, <span class="font-italic">perhaps proportionate to their contribution</span>. Unlike the situation in tenancies in common where the co-owners may own in unequal shares, in the case of a joint tenancy when the issue of the precise entitlement has to be particularised, for example, when there has been an alienation by a joint tenant, it must be in equal shares, for prior to the alienation each was entitled to the whole. If there are three joint tenants in law and in equity, and one of them alienates his interest to a fourth party, the alienee would get one third undivided share. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The above was illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Hwee</span>, where Chan J held, <span class="font-italic">after</span> deciding that a joint tenant (“Y”)’s interest was exigible to a WSS, that Y had a beneficial interest in the property to be attached because the presumption of advancement operated in Y’s favour (despite Y not having contributed to the purchase price).
