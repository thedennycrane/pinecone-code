The fact that the notary signed to indicate that he had witnessed the signatures of Mr Arifin and the witnesses is not enough if the signatures themselves are clearly not present on the document which was the case.

</div> If indeed he did not intend to give the proceeds of sale of the Simprug Property to the plaintiff (or the defendant), it would have been easier for him to cause the proceeds to be paid into one of his personal bank accounts. Yet, he decided otherwise. It was apparent from the evidence that the Initial Citibank Joint Account was set-up according to his wishes although he may have left it to the plaintiff and the defendant to decide which bank to open the joint account with. Mr Arifin then procured the payment of part of the sales proceeds of the Simprug Property in Indonesia by the buyer into the Initial Citibank Joint Account. To my mind, this was strong evidence of Mr Arifin’s intention that the moneys were to be given to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the other hand, even though the defendant was a joint holder of the Initial Citibank Joint Account, it was clear from the evidence that he himself did not think that he had a beneficial interest in the moneys therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, it appears to me that the defendant’s claim that Mr Arifin had told him that the moneys in the Initial Citibank Joint Account were for him and the plaintiff was no more than an afterthought.

</div> While the plaintiff challenged the reason for both of these payments, the point is that it seems strange that the defendant would have had to ask for the agreement of the plaintiff and Mr Arifin to make these payments if it were true that he was beneficially entitled to half the moneys therein. Also, there was no evidence that the defendant ever used the moneys in the Joint Accounts for his personal expenses. In my view, this strongly suggested that the defendant himself never believed that he had any beneficial interest in the moneys in the Joint Accounts. Indeed, in cross-examination the defendant admitted that his motivation in claiming half of the moneys in the Joint Accounts was because he was afraid that the plaintiff would squander the moneys.

The fact that the recipient of property allows the property or the fruit of that property to be used according to the donor’s wishes does not necessarily rebut the presumption of advancement. In <span class="font-italic">Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Byrnes </span>[1911] 1 AC 386 (cited in <span class="font-italic">Chin Kim Yon v Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng Hai </span>[2016] SGHC 2 at [31]), a father transferred properties to his two adult sons but continued to receive rents derived from the properties.

The present case can be distinguished from situations in which the presumption of advancement was found to be rebutted. In <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah and others v Low Geok Khim and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795, the joint accounts in question, while opened in the name of the father and son, were controlled entirely by the former and the latter was never given the opportunity to operate the account at all (at [51]). Here, Mr Arifin was never a holder of the Initial Citibank Joint Account. Also, there was evidence that the plaintiff could use the moneys as she thought fit; the plaintiff possessed a credit card linked to the Initial Citibank Joint Account which she used for her personal expenses.

</div> Further, it was apparent that the defendant and Mdm Ho had a habit of keeping records of their financial transactions. For example, they were able to produce records relating to their overdraft facility which Mr Arifin drew on going back to 1985.

</div> As for obtaining the plaintiff’s consent for transactions, I do not think that this fact goes so far as to prove the existence of an express trust. It is equally consistent with the point that the moneys in the account belonged to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Fourth, I do not think that the defendant’s emails go so far as to prove the existence of an express trust.  The “management” of the plaintiff’s moneys need not have taken place pursuant to an express trust. Another possible legal relationship that comes to mind is an agency relationship (which was not pleaded). One important requirement of an express trust is that the settlor must have intended for the trustee to owe “legally enforceable duties rather than duties of a merely social or moral nature” (John McGhee, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015 at para [22-013]). The defendant’s emails do not demonstrate the existence of such a legally enforceable duty. The available evidence suggested that dealings between the defendant on one hand and the plaintiff and Mr Arifin on the other were often conducted informally. The defendant incurred expenses on behalf of the plaintiff and Mr Arifin and allowed Mr Arifin to draw on his overdraft facility over the years, all without any written agreement or promise of being paid back.

</div> The plaintiff’s point was that the payment should have been attributed to the correct year so that it would either negate or reduce any interest which Mr Arifin had allegedly agreed to pay to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the 2008 Statement, the plaintiff’s objection was that it was based erroneously on the premise that there was a starting sum of S$280,000 due from Mr Arifin to the defendant as at 1992. If the issues identified in [92] were properly addressed, there would not have been such a sum owed.

This would have reduced the interest Mr Arifin was liable for on the balance owed by him to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On the other hand, the defendant’s response was that he and Mdm Ho had frequently tried to reduce the balance on the overdraft account by putting in their own moneys whenever they could. As for the money paid by Mr Arifin towards the purchase of the Hawaii Towers Property, this was a gift to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I do not think that any accounting inaccuracies in the documents which the defendant was relying on, or in the “Surat Keterangan”, assist the plaintiff in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In my view, the 2004 Statement, 2004 November Draft Statement and 2008 Statement have to be viewed in the context of the relationship between the defendant and Mr Arifin. It is clear to me that the dealings, between father and son, were carried out with some informality. There were significant incoming and outgoing funds over the years with neither party ever insisting on a strict accounting. For instance, the defendant and Mdm Ho allowed their overdraft facility with Citibank to be used for Mr Arifin’s purposes without a written agreement from him that he would pay back what he had used.

</div> Aside from the plaintiff’s evidence that Mr Arifin was suffering from dementia (which I do not accept), there was no suggestion that Mr Arifin would not have understood what he was signing. Accordingly, it would have been open to him to decline to agree to any statement of account produced to him. For example, he could have insisted that what he had paid for the Hawaii Towers Property be included in the 2004 and 2008 Statements if it was not meant to be a gift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The English language translation of the “Surat Keterangan” is “explanation letter”. In my view, it was prepared by the defendant for the plaintiff and Mr Arifin to sign to explain the gifts which the parents had made to each of the three sons and the financial assistance rendered by the defendant (and Mdm Ho) to the parents. Apparently, there was already discord among the three sons as Peter and David had perceived that the parents had favoured the defendant.

The “Surat Keterangan” unequivocally states that Mr Arifin and the plaintiff gave the sum of S$220,000 to the defendant. It would defeat the very purpose of the gift if the sum of S$220,000 were to be offset from any outstanding loan balance owed to the defendant by Mr Arifin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 One issue, it seems, is whether the remaining sum of S$280,000 should be included as a loan from Mr Arifin to the defendant (or offset from loans due to the defendant from Mr Arifin). Perhaps. But when the 2008 Statement was signed about a year later, no mention was made therein that the defendant had to repay S$280,000 to Mr Arifin. Instead, the 2008 started with an outstanding balance of S$280,000 owing from both Mr Arifin and the plaintiff to the defendant and Mdm Ho as at 1992. Then it added 3% interest each year.

The plaintiff’s case was that the payments were procured because the defendant fraudulently misrepresented to her that the payments were to set up an “Arifin Fund”, which was to benefit all of the plaintiff’s grandchildren. This misrepresentation induced the plaintiff to sign the transfer forms authorising the payments to the defendant. The defendant then proceeded to use the moneys for the overseas education of his two daughters only.

</div>
</div> it was unclear what this referred to; for example, a safe deposit box. The plaintiff’s counsel did not pursue this point further in cross-examination. The fact that it was kept in a box was equivocal. It does not necessarily mean that the Jewellery was segregated from other jewellery of Mdm Ho to identify the Jewellery as not belonging to Mdm Ho. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 There was also evidence from an email dated 23 June 2014 from the plaintiff to David stating that the plaintiff gave two diamond rings to Michelle Arifin and Kelly Arifin, who are David’s daughters.

</div> So, Mdm Ho was not the only beneficiary of the plaintiff’s generosity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I add that apparently, there were some family meetings to resolve differences before the plaintiff commenced legal action. There were also emails between the defendant on the one hand and the plaintiff and David on the other hand. Some of the emails touched upon the plaintiff’s moneys. None mentioned the Jewellery. Even when the plaintiff’s lawyers demanded the moneys in the Joint Account, they did not ask for the return of the Jewellery. This claim was included only when legal action was commenced. This suggested that initially the plaintiff herself did not think that she was entitled to demand the return of the Jewellery and was inconsistent with her claim that the defendant was holding the same on trust for her all along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 At the end of the day, it was the plaintiff who bore the burden of proving her case on a balance of probabilities. On the evidence presented before the Court, I am of the view that she failed to discharged her burden. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim for the return of the Jewellery fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Nevertheless, it is a pity that Mdm Ho’s position was that she decided not to return the Jewellery because the plaintiff had not made the request (for return) to her directly. It was a poor excuse not to do so. On the other hand, open offers were made by the defendant on terms which included the procuring of the return of the Jewellery to the plaintiff but they came with conditions which were not acceptable to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 While it is tempting to order the return of the Jewellery to the plaintiff in the circumstances, the parties (and Mdm Ho) are entitled to insist on their legal rights.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I declare that the plaintiff is beneficially entitled to the credit balance in the Joint Accounts. In addition, the defendant is to take all necessary and appropriate steps to enable the plaintiff to withdraw the balance, including writing to the relevant banks within 14 days from the date of this judgment to relinquish all claims to the credit balance and inform the banks that they are to act on the sole instruction of the plaintiff. If he fails to do so, the Registrar of the Supreme Court may do so on his behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The rest of the plaintiff’s claims are dismissed.
