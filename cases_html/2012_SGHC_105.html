<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This present appeal and cross appeal arose out
                    of the Assistant Registrar’s assessment of damages pursuant to my decision
                    in <em>Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd v Shiok Skim
                        Seng</em> [2010] SGHC 243 (“the Judgment”). In the
                    Judgment, I found that the Defendant had made out a claim for proprietary
                    estoppel and directed that the quantum of compensation is to be assessed by a
                    Registrar. Also, in the Judgment, I specifically directed that the parties are
                    to be at liberty to clarify the terms of the orders I made, and to apply for any
                    ancillary orders so as to give effect to my judgment. I note that neither party
                    had done so. They proceeded to argue the quantum of compensation before the
                    Assistant Registrar on their respective assumptions and both now appeal against
                    the assessment below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       All the necessary findings of fact are set out
                    in the Judgment and need not be repeated here for the purposes of this appeal
                    against the assessment below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Remedial discretion for proprietary estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Once the court determines that a proprietary
                    estoppel claim has been established, the court is faced with the unusual task of
                    fashioning an appropriate remedy to satisfy the equity. Compared to the
                    principles governing the assessment of damages pursuant to breach of contract,
                    the principles governing the fashioning of an appropriate proprietary estoppel
                    remedy are still not clear cut. This is necessarily so as the appropriate remedy
                    would always turn on the particular facts of each case out of which the
                    proprietary estoppels arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The authors of Kevin Gray &amp; Susan Francis
                    Gray, <em>Elements of Land Law</em> (Oxford University
                    Press, 5th Ed, 2009) noted at para 9.2.95 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]n deciding how to reinforce or concretise the estoppel
                        claimant’s inchoate equity, the court can go much further. <em>The upholding of a claim of proprietary estoppel opens up the
                            court’s jurisdiction to fashion new rights for relevant
                            parties</em>. The general principle of relief was stated over a
                        century ago in <em>Plimmer v Mayor etc of
                            Wellington</em> (1884) 9 App Cas 699 at 714. Here
                        the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that when an equity of
                        estoppel has been raised, ‘<em>the Court must look at
                            the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can be
                            satisfied</em>’. The court has an extremely wide discretion
                        to formulate an appropriate remedy. Sometimes the remedial outcome is
                        tantamount to specific enforcement of the original promise of rights; at the
                        other end of the remedial spectrum the circumstances may call for nothing
                        more than an order for money compensation or a simple injunction restraining
                        the landowner’s exercise of his adverse rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added; footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       While the court in each case has an extremely
                    wide discretion to fashion a remedy, such discretion cannot be exercised
                    arbitrarily and without reference to established principles. Lord Walker
                    cautioned in <em>Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 1 WLR 1752 at [46] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[E]quitable estoppel is a flexible doctrine which the court can use, in
                        appropriate circumstances, to prevent injustice caused by the vagaries and
                        inconstancy of human nature. But it is not a sort of joker or wild card to
                        be used whenever the court disapproves of the conduct of a litigant who
                        seems to have the law on his side. Flexible though it is, the doctrine must
                        be formulated and applied in a disciplined and principled way. Certainty is
                        important in property transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The court’s duty is to do equity and no
                    more than equity: <em>Cameron v Murdoch</em>
                    [1983] WAR 321 at 360. This means that the court, as a court of
                    conscience, goes no further than what is necessary to prevent unconscionable
                    conduct: <em>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher</em>
                    (1988) 164 CLR 387 at 419. The court seeks, amongst other aims, to
                    preserve some kind of proportionality between the detriment which has been
                    incurred by the estoppel claimant and the remedy eventually awarded: <em>Jennings v Rice</em> [2003] 1 P &amp; CR 100
                    at 111 (“<em>Jennings</em>”). In more
                    recent cases, this approach has been referred to as the ‘minimalist
                    approach’. Robert Walker LJ (as he then was) in <em>Gillett v Holt</em> [2001] 1 Ch 210 at 237 neatly explains
                    the minimalist approach as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court’s aim is, having identified the maximum [extent of the
                        equity], to form a view as to what is the minimum required to satisfy it and
                        do justice between the parties. The court must look at all the
                        circumstances, including the need to achieve a “clean break”
                        so far as possible and avoid or minimise future friction: see <em>Pascoe v Turner</em> [1979] 1 WLR 431,
                        438-439.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the present case, I have already found at
                        [33] of the Judgment that an
                    outright order to sell the unit to the Defendant is out of the question, the
                    more appropriate remedy being an award of monetary compensation. I shall now
                    turn to the principles that govern the quantification of such an
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Expectation - or reliance-based approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When awarding monetary compensation as a remedy
                    for a proprietary estoppel claim, the court could adopt either an
                    expectation-based approach or a reliance-based approach in quantifying the
                    compensation, depending on the facts of each case. The difference is that the
                    expectation-based approach looks to the plaintiff’s position had the
                    representations been carried through, whereas the reliance-based approach looks
                    to the plaintiff’s position had the defendant not made the
                    representations. It is clear that while the court may take into account any of
                    the above bases of quantifying the compensation, no single approach is
                    determinative. The court could even arrive at an intermediate figure taking into
                    account the different bases: <em>Clayton v Green</em>
                    (1979) NZRL 139 at 140.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The issue of whether the court should address
                    the claimant’s expectations or the losses or detriment the claimant
                    sustained as a result of his reliance upon the representation was addressed by
                    Sundaresh Menon JC in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v
                        United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292
                        (“<em>Hong Leong</em>”). After
                    undertaking a comprehensive survey of the existing authorities, Menon JC
                    concluded (at [247]-[249]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">247    The approach taken
                            in <em>Jennings v Rice</em> towards fashioning an
                            adequate but proportionate remedy is consistent with that taken in
                            particular by Mason CJ in the Australian High Court decision in
                                <em>Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen</em>
                            (1990) 170 CLR 394. Mason CJ noted as follows
                            at 413:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]here must be a proportionality between the remedy and the detriment
                            which is its purpose to avoid. It would be wholly inequitable and unjust
                            to insist upon a disproportionate making good of the relevant
                            assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">248    This was followed by our Court of Appeal in LS
                            Investment. <b><em>However, it is important to note that
                                proportionality is but one element, albeit a critical one, to be
                                considered in fashioning the appropriate remedy. The court may
                                consider all the relevant circumstances including the expectations,
                                the detriment, avoiding injustice to others </em></b><b>(</b><b><em>see, eg, Giumelli v
                                Giumelli </em></b><b>(</b><b><em>1999</em></b><b>)</b><b><em> 196 CLR 101</em></b><b>)</b><b><em> and the conduct of the
                                parties</em></b><b>.</b> Prof Tan Sook
                            Yee in Singapore Land Law puts it thus at p 104:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts respond to the equity when it is raised, by taking into account
                        all the surrounding circumstances, the conduct and the expectation of the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">249    
              <b><em>The key to this response is
                                flexibility so as to ensure that the remedy is appropriate to the
                                equity in each case.</em></b> It may involve giving effect to the
                            common expectation as was the case in <em>Lim Teng Huan v
                                Ang Swee Chuan</em> [1992] 1 WLR 113; or limiting the
                            relief so as to preserve a degree of proportionality between the
                            detriment and the relief as was the case in Gillett v Holt ([178]
                                <em>supra</em>); or to award monetary relief as
                            was the case locally in <em>Khew Ah Bah v Hong Ah
                                Mye</em> [1971-1973] SLR(R) 107 and in Australia in
                                <em>Giumelli v Giumelli</em> ([248] <em>supra</em>). It may even be found that the equity had
                            been satisfied by enjoyment and was therefore exhausted as was the case
                            in <em>Sledmore v Dalby</em> (1996)
                            72 P &amp; CR 196.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The approach in <em>Jennings</em>, which adopts the fulfilment of the claimant’s
                    expectation as a starting point, has been repeatedly endorsed in subsequent
                    cases. However, I note that the approach has not received universal support.
                    Professor John Mee concluded critically in his chapter “The Role of
                    Expectation in the Determination of Proprietary Estoppel Remedies”
                    published in <em>Modern Studies in Property Law,
                        Volume 5</em> (Hart Publishing, 2009) (Martin Dixon ed) 389 at
                    p 415 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he only appropriate role for expectation is as a cap on a remedy
                        determined on the basis of other factors. This involves a rejection of the
                        notion, supported by <em>Jennings v Rice</em>, that the
                        fulfilment of the expectation should be the <em>prima
                            facie</em> remedy, to be granted unless such a remedy would be
                        disproportionate to the detriment suffered by [the claimant] …
                        [U]nderstandably, courts and commentators feel uneasy with the idea of a
                        completely discretionary approach to remedies. In a sea of discretion, the
                        only two concepts to which one can cling are expectation and
                        detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Therefore, to summarise, the authorities
                    suggest that I am not bound by any specific measure in quantifying the amount of
                    compensation to be awarded. Mr Shiok’s expectations and reliance are
                    certainly relevant factors which I would take into account, but these factors
                    are not determinative. Ultimately, the court would have to look at all the
                    circumstances of the case in order to arrive at a proportionate award that would
                    satisfy the equity raised by the estoppel. The court has discretion to adopt
                    whichever measure (or any intermediate figure) that it considers to be the most
                    appropriate sum given the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With the above principles in mind, I shall now
                    address the quantum of compensation that would in my view sufficiently satisfy
                    the equity raised by the proprietary estoppel claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The content of the equity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The relevant findings of fact in the Judgment
                    that will guide the exercise of my remedial discretion are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    On balance, therefore, I believe
                            Mr Shiok’s story in this regard. <em>I find
                                that, during their first meeting, Mr Lim must have told Mr Shiok
                                that a mezzanine floor could be built and that he would apply for
                                the necessary approvals for the mezzanine floor.</em> There is
                            also no evidence that Mr Lim warned Mr Shiok that a mezzanine
                            floor would be irregular until approved. Since Heng Loong had not
                            entered the picture at this point, these representations must have been
                            made on behalf of the plaintiff. I also find that these representations
                            must have materially induced Mr Shiok into entering into the first
                            tenancy agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    On the evidence, I find that Mr Lim must have
                            represented to Mr Shiok, at the time the first tenancy agreement
                            was signed, that he could buy the unit at some point in time. Otherwise
                            Mr Shiok would not have invested so much into the unit. The
                            renovation by Heng Loong alone cost over $100,000 and took six months.
                            This expenditure in terms of money and time could not have been
                            justified on the formal terms of the first tenancy agreement which
                            lasted two years and for which Mr Shiok was willing to pay $3,200 a
                            month. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    
              <em>I therefore find, on the basis
                                of the parties’ dealings during the first tenancy agreement,
                                that Mr Lim had represented to Mr Shiok that he could buy the
                                unit. And in material and detrimental reliance thereon,
                                Mr Shiok entered into the first tenancy agreement, renovated
                                the unit and built the mezzanine floor.</em>
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A closer scrutiny of my findings of fact above
                    would quickly reveal that there were actually two different representations that
                    Mr Lim made to Mr Shiok. The first representation that Mr Lim
                    made was that Mr Shiok could build a mezzanine floor and that Mr Lim
                    would apply for the relevant approvals. The second representation that
                    Mr Lim made was that Mr Shiok could buy the unit from Mr Lim at
                    some point in time. Following my finding of proprietary estoppel, the equities
                    that are raised in respect of these two representations ought to be satisfied by
                    monetary compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Although the two representations are somewhat
                    related, it would be conceptually clearer to treat them as independent of each
                    other when considering the appropriate remedy to satisfy each
                equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Representation that Mr Shiok could build a mezzanine floor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The equity that arose in respect to this
                    representation is different from that which arose in respect to the
                    representation that Mr Shiok could purchase the unit, because
                    Mr Shiok’s expectation could not have been fulfilled here. The
                    mezzanine floor would have caused the plot ratio of the building to exceed the
                    legally permissible ratio, making the expectation illegal. If I follow the
                    approach in <em>Jennings</em> and take
                    Mr Shiok’s expectation as a starting point, he would recover nothing.
                    This is clearly not an appropriate measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Since there is no legally referable
                    expectation to speak of, I am of the view that compensation should be assessed
                    on the basis of the detriment incurred. In this regard, in fashioning an award,
                    I shall consider both (i) the cost of the improvement, and (ii) the
                    enhancement to the value of the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This case is unusual in the sense that the
                    improvements made to the land in the form of an additional mezzanine floor were
                    illegal and had to be removed pursuant to a court order. That left the condition
                    of the land in the same state as that before any improvements were made to it.
                    Therefore, an assessment based on the enhancement to the value of the land would
                    cause Mr Shiok to recover nothing. This is clearly not an appropriate
                    measure either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Therefore, the more appropriate (and in fact,
                    only) measure that I can take into account is the cost of improvements.
                    Mr Shiok’s counsel submitted that the renovation costs amounted to
                    $188,817.98. I take this figure into account in my final award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On a separate note, the cost of removing the
                    mezzanine floor would ordinarily have been a cost incidental to the
                    representation made by Mr Lim to Mr Shiok that he could build a
                    mezzanine floor. However, in this case, since the plaintiff had already removed
                    the mezzanine floor at its own cost, I accordingly hold that no compensation for
                    the costs of removal of the mezzanine floor is to be awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Representation that Mr Shiok could purchase the premises</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The representation that Mr Shiok could
                    purchase the premises could have been legally fulfilled, unlike the expectation
                    that Mr Shiok could build a mezzanine floor. Therefore, following the
                    approach in <em>Jennings</em>, I take Mr Shiok’s
                    expectation, <em>ie</em>, the position that Mr Shiok
                    would have been in had he had the opportunity to purchase the premises, as the
                        <em>prima facie</em> basis of compensation, unless the
                    outcome is disproportionate to the detriment suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Besides having lost the opportunity to
                    purchase the premises, Mr Shiok was also put through a series of related
                    summonses in this suit that would not have occurred had Mr Lim made good
                    this representation. Therefore, I also take the legal costs into account when
                    determining the appropriate award to satisfy this equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Loss of opportunity to purchase the premises</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is clear on the facts that Mr Shiok had
                    lost the opportunity to purchase the premises because of Mr Lim’s
                    conduct. I had already found at [29] of
                    the Judgment that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    …
                            <em>In particular, the first tenancy agreement’s
                                duration of two years shows that it must have existed as an
                                understanding between the parties alongside their contractual
                                arrangements.</em> I find additional support for this
                            conclusion in the note scribbled by Mr Lim on Mr Shiok’s
                            letter of 27 November 2006 (see <em>supra</em>
                            [16]), stating that a sale might be delayed to September 2007 pending
                            the issuance of the CSC. The note may well be an internal note, as
                            Mr Lim claimed. <em>However, its existence indicated
                                that the possibility of a sale to Mr Shiok, albeit outside the terms
                                of the first tenancy agreement, was very much on the mind of
                                Mr Lim.</em> Otherwise, there seemed no reason why the
                            note would be scribbled on Mr Shiok’s letter, as opposed to some
                            other place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the ordinary course of events, Mr Lim
                    could not have sold the promises at the agreed price without offering Mr Shiok
                    the opportunity to purchase the premises first. However, by conducting himself
                    in a manner “that was not beyond reproach”, as I have found at
                    [35] of the Judgment, Mr Lim had caused Mr Shiok to lose the
                    opportunity to purchase the unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for Mr Lim submitted that this
                    opportunity is valueless because, first, the condition precedent under the
                    second tenancy agreement requiring a Certificate of Statutory Completion
                    (“CSC”) to be issued had not been fulfilled; and second, even if
                    the condition precedent was fulfilled, the parties had not agreed upon the price
                    and timing of the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I find Mr Lim’s submissions on this
                    issue to be misconceived. The reason why a party would choose to rely on the
                    doctrine of proprietary estoppel is precisely because he is not entitled to his
                    strict legal rights. Also, even though the parties had not agreed upon a price
                    and the time of sale, the opportunity to purchase does not become valueless. A
                    loss of a chance, no matter how small, is still the loss of something of value
                    and is thus capable of being the subject of compensation. The difficulty in
                    valuing the chance is an entirely different matter altogether. In the context of
                    a personal injury claim, Lord Diplock explained in <em>Mallett v McMonagle</em> [1970] AC 166 at 176
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The role of the court in making an assessment of damages which depends
                        upon its view as to what will be and what would have been is to be
                        contrasted with its ordinary function in civil actions of determining what
                        was. In determining what did happen in the past a court decides on the
                        balance of probabilities. Anything that is more probable than not it treats
                        as certain. <em>But in assessing damages which depend upon
                            its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in
                            the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must
                            make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing will
                            or would have happened and reflect those chances, whether they are more
                            or less than even, in the amount of damages which it
                        awards.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Although these principles are taken from a
                    different context, I find that they are equally applicable in the present case.
                    The opportunity to purchase the unit is clearly of some value to Mr Shiok
                    since he had already invested more than $100,000 in renovation costs, and it is
                    undeniable that Mr Shiok had lost the opportunity when Mr Lim
                    ultimately did not allow him to purchase the unit. It is irrelevant whether or
                    not Mr Shiok could have bought the unit because, even if Mr Shiok
                    could not have bought the unit himself, he had given evidence that there were
                    unnamed persons who were willing to back him up, as I have found at [33] of the Judgment. Therefore, justice would
                    necessitate me ascribing some value to this lost opportunity in order to satisfy
                    the equity raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, in the absence of any submissions to
                    guide the exercise of my discretion in valuing this lost opportunity, I would
                    adopt a minimalist approach in coming up with a figure. This figure must be low
                    enough such that reasonable men would not regard it as excessive or extravagant,
                    but high enough such that if it was to be set any lower, reasonable men would
                    not regard it as sufficient to satisfy the equity raised. Taking into account
                    the fact that the opportunity was not an option but merely a right of first
                    refusal, I am of the view that 10% of $462,054.00 (the agreed purchase price
                    under the first tenancy agreement) would be an appropriate reflection of the
                    value of Mr Shiok’s lost opportunity. This works out to
                    $46,205.40.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Costs of litigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I stated above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> that Mr Shiok was put through a series of law suits
                    instituted by Mr Lim in respect of the mezzanine floor and the premises, that
                    would not have occurred had Mr Lim made good his representations. I have found
                    in the Judgment that Mr Shiok had successfully made out a claim of
                    proprietary estoppel. This also meant that Mr Lim was not entitled to
                    insist upon his strict legal rights by commencing and pursuing several legal
                    actions against Mr Shiok, despite having made the representations earlier.
                    Therefore, I am of the view that the legal costs that Mr Shiok incurred in
                    order to defend all the related suits commenced by Mr Lim with respect to
                    the mezzanine floor and the recovery of the premises should also be recoverable
                    as compensation. To hold otherwise would have been grossly unfair to
                    Mr Shiok, since these legal costs had arisen from the very subject matter
                    over which proprietary estoppel was found to have operated against
                    Mr Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, as I had not directed the parties to
                    make any submissions as to the quantum of legal costs incurred by Mr Shiok
                    so far, I order that this portion of compensation is to be agreed upon or
                    otherwise subject to taxation by the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of actual or potential profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I do not consider that the loss of profits to
                    Mr Shiok, whether actual or potential, to be a relevant factor to take into
                    consideration in fashioning an appropriate award of compensation in the present
                    case. Given that I have already awarded Mr Shiok (i) the full cost of
                    installing the mezzanine floor; (ii) the loss of an opportunity to purchase
                    the unit; and (iii) the costs of defending all the earlier related legal
                    suits arising from the same subject matter, I am of the view that the equity
                    raised by the proprietary estoppel claim has been satisfied. To award
                    Mr Shiok the loss of his actual or potential profits as well would clearly
                    be grossly disproportionate to the equity raised in the present case. I stress
                    again that the aim of fashioning a proprietary estoppel remedy is to satisfy the
                    equity and not to indemnify Mr Shiok for all the losses that he had
                    suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Therefore, taking into account all the factors
                    raised in this judgment, I am of the view that the minimum sum that
                    Mr Shiok is entitled to in order to satisfy the equity raised is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Cost of installing the mezzanine
                        floor amounting to $188,817.98;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Costs for all related legal actions to be agreed or
                taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I further order simple interest of 5.33% per
                    annum to be payable on items (a) and (b) above starting from 8 October
                    2008, being the date on which Mr Shiok filed his defence and counterclaim.
                    No interest is payable on item (c).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Given that neither party had succeeded fully
                    in this appeal, I make no order as to costs. However, for clarity, I note that
