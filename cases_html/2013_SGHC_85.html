        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the Law Society of
                    Singapore (“the Law Society”) pursuant to s 94(1) read with
                    s 98 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”) for Wan Hui Hong James (“the
                    respondent”), an advocate and solicitor of 42 years’ standing, to
                    be punished under s 83 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The misconduct to which the respondent admitted
                    consisted of accepting a significant gift from a client without advising the
                    client to seek independent advice in respect of the gift. The respondent further
                    admitted that he had thereby breached r 46 of the Legal Profession
                    (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”). However, the respondent denied the Law
                    Society’s allegation that he had been dishonest. After hearing parties, we
                    found that the respondent had indeed been dishonest, and accordingly, we ordered
                    that he be struck off the roll. We now set out the reasons for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The rule on solicitors receiving gifts from clients</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before turning to the facts and issues in this
                    case, we take the opportunity to clarify the rationale and purport of r 46
                    of the Rules. As there has been no judicial guidance thus far on r 46
                    – this being the first occasion on which a breach of that rule has come
                    before this Court as far as we can ascertain – we think that it would now
                    be appropriate to provide some such measure of guidance to the profession.
                    Rule 46 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">Gift by will or inter vivos from
                        client</p>

                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The rule in other jurisdictions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In England, the professional obligations of
                    solicitors are currently described in the Solicitors Regulation Authority Code
                    of Conduct 2011 (“the English Code of Conduct 2011”). The approach
                    taken there is a novel one called “[o]utcomes-focused regulation”.
                    This approach eschews specific rules of conduct, and instead lays down conduct
                    guidelines at a higher level of generality by defining broad mandatory
                    “Principles” and “outcomes”.
                    “Principles” include “not allow[ing] your independence to
                    be compromised” and “act[ing] in the best interests of each
                    client”, while “outcomes” include “treat[ing] your
                    clients fairly” (O(1.1)) and “provid[ing] services to your clients
                    in a manner which protects their interests in their matter, subject to the
                    proper administration of justice” (O(1.2)). The English Code of Conduct
                    2011 also includes certain “indicative behaviours” which, while
                    not mandatory, describe conduct which “may tend to show”
                    achievement of the “outcomes” and compliance with the
                    “Principles” - both of which <em>are</em>
                    mandatory. “Indicative behaviour” 1.9 (IB(1.9)) in the English
                    Code of Conduct 2011 is the closest analogue to r 46 of the Rules, and
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[R]efusing to act where your client proposes to make a gift of significant
                        value to you or a member of your family, or a member of your firm or their
                        family, unless the client takes independent legal advice ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">IB 1.9 of the English Code of Conduct 2011 is based on
                    r 3.04 of an earlier version of the same code in 2007 (“the English
                    Code of Conduct 2007”). The English Code of Conduct 2007 was not
                    “outcomes-focused” like the English Code of Conduct 2011, but
                    instead prescribed specific rules of conduct. Rule 3.04 of the English Code
                    of Conduct 2007 read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>3.04 Accepting gifts from
                            clients</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a client proposes to make a
                        lifetime gift or a gift on death to, or for the benefit of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    you;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    any principal, owner or employee of your
                                firm;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    a family member of any of the
                            above,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and the gift is of a significant amount, either in itself or having regard
                        to the size of the client’s estate and the reasonable expectations of
                        the prospective beneficiaries, you must advise the client to take
                        independent advice about the gift, unless the client is a member of the
                        beneficiary’s family. If the client refuses, you must stop acting for
                        the client in relation to the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Another analogue to r 46 of the Rules may
                    be found in r 11.2 of the Australian state of New South Wales’
                    Professional Conduct and Practice Rules 1995 (“the New South Wales
                    rules”) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.2  A practitioner who receives instructions from a
                            person to –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.2.1    draw a will under which the practitioner or an
                            associate will, or may, receive a substantial benefit other than any
                            proper entitlement to commission ... and the reasonable professional
                            fees of the practitioner or the practitioner’s firm;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.2.2    draws any other instrument under which the
                            practitioner or an associate will, or may, receive a substantial benefit
                            in addition to the practitioner’s reasonable remuneration ... must
                            decline to act on those instructions and offer to refer the person, for
                            advice, to another practitioner who is not an associate of the
                            practitioner, unless the person instructing the practitioner is
                            either:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.2.3    a member of the practitioner’s immediate
                            family; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.2.4    a practitioner, or a member of the immediate
                            family of a practitioner, who is a partner, employer, or employee, of
                            the practitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We should say that we refer to these rules in
                    other jurisdictions for the points of divergence, rather than the convergence
                    that exists between them and r 46 of the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rationale for the rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is often said that the rule on advocates and
                    solicitors receiving gifts from their clients stems from the fact that an
                    advocate and solicitor stands as a fiduciary in relation to his client. The
                    broad idea behind this statement is undoubtedly correct, but it might perhaps
                    benefit from a greater degree of clarity because, in the words of
                    Professor P D Finn (“Finn”) at the beginning of his
                    seminal work <em>Fiduciary Obligations</em> (The Law Book
                    Company Ltd, 1977), the term “fiduciary” is “one of the
                    most ill-defined, if not altogether misleading terms in our law” (at
                    para 1). In Finn’s view, it is preferable to focus not on fiduciary
                        <em>relationships</em>, but on fiduciary <em>obligations</em> (at paras 2–3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the modern usage of “fiduciary”, Sealy concluded that it
                        is not definitive of a single class of relationships to which fixed rules
                        and principles apply. <b>Rather its use has generally been
                            descriptive, providing a veil behind which individual rules and
                            principles have been developed.</b> This conclusion—an
                        incontestable one—is the starting point of this work. In the following
                        pages it will be suggested that it is meaningless to talk of fiduciary
                        relationships as such. Once one looks to the rules and principles which
                        actually have been evolved, it quickly becomes apparent that it is pointless
                        to describe a person—or for that matter a power—as being
                        fiduciary unless at the same time it is said for the purposes of which
                        particular rules and principles that description is being used. <b>These rules are everything. The description
                            “fiduciary”, nothing.</b> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <b>It is not because a person is a
                            “fiduciary” or a “confidant” that a rule
                            applies to him. It is because a particular rule applies to him that he
                            is a fiduciary or confidant </b><b><em>for its
                            purposes</em></b><b>.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in orginal in italics; emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same vein, in the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</em> [1998]
                    Ch 1, Millett LJ (as he then was) opined at 18C that a fiduciary
                    “is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is
                    because he is subject to them that he is a fiduciary”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Accordingly, we would say that the rule on
                    advocates and solicitors receiving gifts from their clients stems from the fact
                    that the relationship between an advocate and solicitor and his client is of
                    such a nature as to warrant the imposition of fiduciary obligations on him. What
                    then is the nature of their relationship? It is one in which the advocate and
                    solicitor undertakes to act on behalf of his client and to take up his
                    client’s cause as his own, which then gives rise to a duty to act in the
                    client’s interests. In this relationship the advocate and solicitor almost
                    invariably assumes a position of ascendency and influence over his client who
                    then relies on and trusts him. As a consequence, he is subject to two fiduciary
                    obligations, adopting for present purposes Finn’s classification of the
                    various fiduciary obligations as outlined at paras 161–168. The first
                    is not to put himself in a position where his personal interests conflict with
                    his duty to act in the interests of his client. The second is not to exercise
                    undue influence over his client, <em>ie</em>, not to
                    misuse, whether actively or passively, his influence over his client. When his
                    client intends to make a gift to him, or to a person with whom he has close
                    personal or professional ties, these two fiduciary obligations are related in
                    the sense that, even though the apparent interests of both parties seem to be
                    aligned (since both parties seem to desire that the gift be made to him), he is
                    deemed to be in a position of conflict because of the presumption that his
                    client is making the gift under his undue influence. As Vaughan Williams LJ
                    noted in <em>Wright v Carter</em> [1903] 1 Ch 27
                        (“<em>Wright</em>”) at 50:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]henever you have these fiduciary relations (and in the present case we
                        have to deal with the particular fiduciary relation of solicitor and
                        client), <b><em>the moment the relation is established, there
                            arises a presumption of influence</em></b><em>, which
                            presumption will continue as long as the relation, such as that of

<em>Wright</em> was not a case involving
                    disciplinary proceedings against a solicitor. Rather, it was a civil case in
                    which the plaintiff sought to set aside a gift that he had made to his
                    solicitor. Yet the essence of the principle articulated therein by Vaughan
                    Williams LJ nonetheless remains relevant even in disciplinary cases,
                    because that same restraint which makes a gift made to a solicitor liable to be
                    set aside would also place the solicitor under an ethical duty to refrain from
                    accepting a questionable gift from his client.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       When a client intends to make a gift to an
                    advocate and solicitor, there is an ethical duty on him to remove, as far as he
                    can, any vestiges of influence (or the appearance thereof) he might have over
                    his client by virtue of their relationship. In the words of Dixon J in the
                    High Court of Australia in <em>Johnson v Buttress</em>
                    (1936) 56 CLR 113 at 135:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is his duty to use his position of influence in the interest of no one
                        but the man who is governed by his judgment, gives him his dependence and
                        entrusts him with his welfare. When he takes from that man a substantial
                        gift of property, <em>it is incumbent upon him to show that
                            it cannot be ascribed to the inequality between them which must arise
                            from his special position.</em> He may be taken to possess a
                        peculiar knowledge not only of the disposition itself but of the
                        circumstances which should affect its validity ; he has chosen to
                        accept a benefit which may well proceed from an abuse of the authority
                        conceded to him, or the confidence reposed in him ; and the relations
                        between him and the donor are so close as to make it difficult to
                        disentangle the inducements which led to the transaction. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The removal of any vestiges of influence is, in essence, what r 46 of
                    the Rules mandates. It stipulates two distinct obligations to be met in the
                    discharge of that ethical duty. One is that the advocate and solicitor must
                    advise the client to be independently advised. The other is that he must refuse
                    to act for his client, or to act for his client any longer. The scope and
                    content of these two obligations will be considered below. When an advocate and
                    solicitor fails to comply with r 46 of the Rules, disciplinary action is taken
                    against him because he is taken to have misused his influence over his client,
                    and thus to have put himself in a position where his personal interests conflict
                    with his duty to act in the interests of his client.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Significant gift”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As the text makes clear, r 46 of the
                    Rules applies only when a “significant” gift is intended. Where
                    the gift is of a trifling nature, it is not presumed to have been made or
                    intended under the influence of the solicitor-client relationship, because it is
                    the sort of gift that would not seem untoward in any ordinary relationship
                    between non-strangers. But where the gift is a significant one, it is no longer
                    readily explicable on the basis of ordinary sentiment, and this attracts the
                    presumption that it is explicable only on the basis of influence arising from
                    the solicitor-client relationship. In the context of r 46 of the Rules, a
                    “significant” gift must mean not only a gift significant in
                    absolute terms, but also a gift significant having regard to the client’s
                    means and the reasonable expectations of other prospective beneficiaries, if
                    any. This is the amplified definition of “significant” in the
                    English Code of Conduct 2007, and it is, in our view, also the correct meaning
                    to be attributed to “significant” as used in r 46 of the Rules. An
                    improvident widow who intends a gift of all that she has in the world surely
                    intends a significant gift even if its monetary value may not be significant in
                    relation to the assets of the advocate and solicitor. In the final analysis,
                    what is significant will be fact sensitive and assessed on a case by case
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As a rule of thumb, the more significant the
                    gift, the stronger the presumption that the gift is influenced by the
                    solicitor-client fiduciary relationship, and the more imperative the need for
                    the client to be independently advised in respect of the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Shall advise the client to be independently
                advised”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The advocate and solicitor to whom his client
                    intends a significant gift is obliged to advise his client to be independently
                    advised in respect of the gift, because the dispassionate counsel of an
                    uninvolved party is needed to establish that his client’s judgment has not
                    been clouded by influence arising from their solicitor-client relationship. It
                    should be observed that this obligation arises regardless of the nature of the
                    matter in which the advocate and solicitor acts for his client. In New South
                    Wales, the obligation to refer the client for independent advice arises only
                    when the nature of the solicitor’s involvement is that of drawing up the
                    client’s will, or any other instrument by which a disposal of his
                    client’s property is effected. In Singapore, by contrast, the width of
                    r 46 of the Rules is such that the obligation arises even if the intended
                    gift is wholly unrelated to the matter in which the advocate and solicitor is
                    acting for the client.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     What then does it mean for the client to be
                    independently advised? The phrase “independent advice” is defined
                    in r 32 of the Rules, but that definition applies only to
                    rr 33–34, and in any event it does not elaborate on what the content
                    of the advice should be. As such we look elsewhere for guidance. The question
                    arises not infrequently in civil cases where the donor of a gift seeks to set
                    aside a gift made to a fiduciary (not necessarily a solicitor). In that context,
                    the Privy Council in <em>Inche Noriah v Shaik Allie bin
                        Omar</em> [1929] AC 127 (“<em>Inche
                        Noriah</em>”) declared at 135:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is necessary for the [fiduciary] to prove that the gift was the result
                        of the <em>free exercise of independent will</em>. The
                        most obvious way to prove this is by establishing that the gift was made
                        after <em>the nature and effect of the transaction had been
                            fully explained</em> to the donor by some independent and
                            <em>qualified</em> person so completely as to
                        satisfy the Court that the donor was acting independently of any influence
                        from the [fiduciary] and with the <em>full appreciation of
                            what he was doing</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following observations of Fletcher Mouton LJ in an earlier
                    case of the English Court of Appeal <em>In re Coomber</em>;
                        <em>Coomber v Coomber</em> [1911] 1 Ch 723
                        (“<em>Coomber</em>”) at 729–730 are
                    also instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that a solicitor best gives advice when he takes care that the
                        client <em>understands fully the nature of the act and the
                            consequences of that act</em>. He is not bound to say “I
                        will advise you to do it” ; or “if I were you I would do
                        it” ; or “if I were you I would not do it.”
                        Nothing of that kind is necessary for competent and independent advice. All
                        that is necessary is that <em>some independent person, free
                            from any taint of the relationship, or of the consideration of interest
                            which would affect the act</em>, should put clearly before the
                        person what are the nature and the consequences of the act. It is for adult
                        persons of competent mind to decide whether they will do an act, and I do
                        not think that independent and competent advice means independent and
                        competent approval. It simply means that <em>the advice shall
                            be removed entirely from the suspected
                        atmosphere </em>; and that from the clear language of an
                        independent mind, they should know precisely what they are doing. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It will be noted that, while Fletcher Moulton LJ was conscious of
                    the need for a prospective donor of a gift to receive independent advice when
                    the intended recipient of the gift is a fiduciary, he was also concerned that
                    the standard of independent advice required should not be unduly
                high.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The preceding remarks were all addressed to
                    the question of a fiduciary’s entitlement to retain a gift, and not the
                    question of whether a solicitor had fulfilled his professional obligation to
                    advise his client to be independently advised in respect of an intended gift.
                    Nevertheless, these remarks provide helpful guidance on the scope of a
                    solicitor’s ethical duties in that regard, insofar as they inform what he
                    should say when advising his client to be independently advised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It should be remembered that the obligation of
                    the advocate and solicitor under r 46 of the Rules is to <em>advise</em> the client to be independently advised. He is in no
                    position to dictate or supervise the content of the independent advice, and
                    therefore does not deserve sanction just because the independent advice is
                    somehow inadequate. On the other hand, he does not fulfil his obligation merely
                    by telling his client “You should seek independent advice” without
                    more. Something in the way of the formulation of Cozens-Hardy MR in
                        <em>Coomber</em> at 726 comes closer to the mark:
                    “I cannot take this unless you have independent advice; consult an
                    independent solicitor, put the matter before him, and he must explain the matter
                    fully to you”. Yet even that appears too perfunctory to suffice,
                    especially if it is said as an afterthought – so what more must the
                    advocate and solicitor do?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In our view, <em>Royal Bank of
                        Scotland plc v Etridge (No 2)</em> [2002] 2 AC 773
                        (“<em>Etridge</em>”) provides a measure
                    of guidance, even though that case dealt with a rather different set of facts.
                    In <em>Etridge</em> a number of wives had each charged her
                    interest in her home in favour of a bank as security for her husband’s or
                    his company’s debts. Each wife later sought to set aside this charge on
                    the ground that she had been under the undue influence of her husband.
                    Lord Nicholls described, at [79], the steps that a bank wishing to uphold
                    the transaction should take whenever a transaction is questionable enough to put
                    the bank on inquiry:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I consider the bank should take steps to check <em>directly with the wife</em> the name of the solicitor she wishes
                        to act for her. To this end, in future the bank should communicate directly
                        with the wife, informing her that for its own protection it will require
                        written confirmation from a solicitor, acting for her, to the effect that
                        the solicitor has fully explained to her the nature of the documents and the
                        practical implications they will have for her. She should be told that the
                        purpose of this requirement is that thereafter she should not be able to
                        dispute she is legally bound by the documents once she has signed them. She
                        should be asked to nominate a solicitor whom she is willing to instruct to
                        advise her, separately from her husband, and act for her in giving the
                        necessary confirmation to the bank ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If the bank is not willing to undertake the task of explanation
                        itself, the bank must provide the solicitor with the financial information
                        he needs for this purpose. Accordingly it should become routine practice for
                        banks, if relying on confirmation from a solicitor for their protection, to
                        send to the solicitor the necessary financial information. What is required
                        must depend on the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Notwithstanding the dissimilarities between
                        <em>Etridge</em> and the present disciplinary
                    proceedings before us, <em>Etridge</em> is of assistance
                    because, in one crucial respect, the position of the banks in that case is
                    similar to the position of an advocate and solicitor to whom his client intends
                    a significant gift. Both have an obligation to advise a person presumed to be
                    under the influence of another person to be independently advised, so as to
                    ensure that the former makes a decision which is an uninfluenced expression of
                    personal volition. This obligation exists even though neither banks nor
                    advocates and solicitors have direct control over the content of independent
                    advice received by the person under the presumed influence. Therefore, the steps
                    which a bank should take in an <em>Etridge</em>-type
                    situation, and the steps which an advocate and solicitor should take in a
                    situation falling under r 46 of the Rules, are directed at the same goal
                    (safeguarding the autonomy of the person presumed to be influenced), and subject
                    to the same limitation (inability to ensure personally that the independent
                    advice is of sufficiently emancipating quality, owing to an inability to
                    intervene directly in that independent advice). It follows that the steps to be
                    taken by both should not be too divergent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Drawing together the threads identified in
                        <em>Inche Noriah</em>, <em>Coomber</em> and <em>Etridge</em>, we now
                    elaborate on the content of an advocate and solicitor’s obligation, under
                    r 46 of the Rules, to advise his client to be independently advised in
                    respect of the gift:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     He should explain to his client the
                        reason why independent advice is required, <em>viz</em>, to ensure that the client’s decision to make a gift
                        to him is a free exercise of independent will, given the presumption that
                        the decision is influenced by the solicitor-client relationship. He should
                        explain that, even if the client does not perceive any influence, such
                        influence may nevertheless exist, <em>eg</em>,
                        influence arising from the client’s gratitude towards the advocate and
                        solicitor for help in navigating the forbidding labyrinth that is the law;
                        under such influence, decisions may be made that the client will later, upon
                        sober reflection, regret. He should explain that the independent advice must
                        give the client a full understanding of the nature and consequences of the
                        gift which is intended. He should emphasise, repeatedly if necessary, the
                        importance of receiving independent advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Since the independent advice must proceed from
                        someone sufficiently qualified to render it, we would, for the sake of
                        clarity, draw bright lines and make it a rule that the person giving the
                        independent advice be another advocate and solicitor, no matter how
                        uncomplicated the legal issues involved.</p>

                        intended, should ask his client to nominate the advising advocate and
                        solicitor. He should then ensure that the advising advocate and solicitor
                        has no connections or involvement which would in any way compromise
                        independence. This is not to say that the advising advocate and solicitor
                        can never be someone known to the donee advocate and solicitor – given
                        the relatively small size of the legal profession here, it is perhaps
                        difficult for legal professionals to avoid knowing one another. This is also
                        not to say that the donee advocate and solicitor absolutely cannot refer his
                        client to an advising advocate and solicitor, even to an advising advocate
                        and solicitor whom he knows. However, if the advising advocate and solicitor
                        is known to the donee advocate and solicitor, and issues subsequently arise
                        as to the propriety of the gift, then the advice given by the advising
                        advocate and solicitor, as well as the context in which the advising
                        advocate and solicitor became involved, will come under even closer
                        scrutiny, and all the more so if the advising advocate and solicitor was not
                        chosen by the client but was referred to the client by the donee advocate
                        and solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The donee advocate and solicitor should advise his client to obtain written
                        confirmation from the advising advocate and solicitor to the effect that a
                        full explanation of the nature of the transaction, and its practical
                        implications, has been furnished.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the transaction by which the gift is to be made is of
                        some complexity, he should provide the advising advocate and solicitor with
                        all information necessary to make the independent advice sufficiently
                        comprehensive. However, in providing such information, he must not say or do
                        anything which would influence the views of the advising advocate and
                        solicitor in respect of the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"></a>(f)     He may tell the client that, whatever the
                        content of the independent advice, the decision is ultimately the
                        client’s to make, but he must not convey even the slightest impression
                        that such independent advice is but a formality.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_g"></a>(g)     Should the client decline to seek
                        independent advice for whatever reason, he should insist with some force
                        that his client do so, and reiterate the importance of receiving that
                        independent advice. In the absence of such advice, the advocate and
                        solicitor should decline to accept the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Shall not act for the client”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The other obligation stipulated in r 46 of the
                    Rules is that the advocate and solicitor “shall not act for the
                    client”. Now r 46 of the Rules itself is ambiguous on whether the
                    phrase “in respect of the gift” qualifies only the obligation to
                    “advise the client to be independently advised”, or whether it
                    qualifies also the other obligation to “not act for the client”.
                    Approaching this ambiguity in the abstract, it is not difficult to see why an
                    advocate and solicitor should be obliged to refuse to act when he acts
                    “in respect of the gift”. When he so acts, the client is presumed
                    to look to him for advice and guidance concerning the gift. Consequently, it is
                    thus presumed that he continues to exert influence over the client’s
                    judgment in relation to the gift, notwithstanding the independent advice which
                    the client may have received. Conversely, if the advocate and solicitor acts for
                    the client not “in respect of the gift” – in other words, in
                    a matter unrelated to the gift – he is not relied upon for advice and
                    guidance pertaining to the gift, and it is not presumed that the client’s
                    judgment in making the gift was influenced by him. This is so long as the client
                    received independent advice or was at least advised to be independently advised.
                    Therefore, as a matter of commonsense, our view is that the phrase “in
                    respect of the gift” qualifies also the obligation “shall not act
                    for the client”. In other words, the advocate and solicitor’s
                    obligation to refuse to act arises only when continuing to act would be acting
                    “in respect of the gift”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     What then does it mean to act “in
                    respect of the gift”? A clear instance of so acting is when the advocate
                    and solicitor draws up an instrument by which a disposal of the client’s
                    property is effected, such as a will. By drawing up such an instrument, he would
                    be directly assisting the client’s intended disposal of the client’s
                    property to himself – that is, the intended gift – and he is
                    therefore considered to be acting “in respect of the gift”.
                    Contrariwise, a clear instance of not acting “in respect of the
                    gift” is when he acts for his client in a litigation matter, and the gift
                    which the client intends does not require his assistance to effect, <em>eg</em>, a gift of cash or in the form of a cheque. Yet,
                    between such clear instances lies murkier territory. For instance, does an
                    advocate and solicitor act in “respect of the gift” when he acts
                    in the sale of his client’s property, and the client intends to make a
                    gift to him of part of the sale proceeds? While much will depend on the facts
                    and circumstances of each case, the essential question in each inquiry is
                    whether the nature of the matter in which the advocate and solicitor acts for
                    his client is such as to warrant the presumption that the client’s
                    judgment in making the gift is influenced by the advocate and
                solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     All we have said on the obligation to refuse
                    to act is consistent with the sparse comments considering that obligation.
                    Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Ethics and Professional Responsibility:
                        A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor</em> (Academy Publishing, 2007)
                    at para 17-018 states r 46 of the Rules as providing that the advocate
                    and solicitor “must not act, and is obliged to counsel the client to be
                    independently advised, in respect of the gift”; the comma after the words
                    “independently advised” indicates the view that “in respect
                    of the gift” qualifies also the obligation “shall not act for the
                    client”. The <em>Guide to Professional Conduct for
                        Advocates and Solicitors</em> (Alvin Chen gen ed) (Law Society of
                    Singapore, 2011) at p 31 reproduces a Guidance Note of 4 December 2007
                    from the Law Society’s Ethics Committee expressing the view that, where a
                    solicitor’s parents instruct him to prepare a will under which he would
                    receive a gift, “rule 46 [of the Rules] does not prohibit a
                    solicitor from acting for his parents in contentious matters unrelated to the
                    gift, subject to the general rules on conflict of interest and common
                    law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Hence where the advocate and solicitor does
                    not act “in respect of the gift”, there is no obligation on him to
                    refuse to act for his client; his only obligation is to advise the client to be
                    independently advised in respect of the gift. However, where he does indeed act
                    “in respect of the gift”, then he has two obligations which are
                    cumulative and not alternative. Unlike the English Code of Conduct 2007 where
                    the obligation to refuse to act only arises if the client refuses to take
                    independent advice about the gift, an advocate and solicitor in Singapore who
                    acts “in respect of the gift” is obliged both to refuse to act and
                    to advise the client to be independently advised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Client who is related to the advocate and solicitor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the English Code of Conduct 2007 and the
                    New South Wales rules, the solicitor’s obligations to refuse to act and to
                    advise the client to be independently advised do not arise where the client is
                    closely related to the solicitor. In Singapore, however, r 46 of the Rules
                    contains no such exception. Those obligations apply regardless of the degree of
                    propinquity in the relationship between an advocate and solicitor and his
                    client. As is made clear in the same Guidance Note from the Law Society’s
                    Ethics Committee referred to at [21] above, the obligations apply even if it is
                    the solicitor’s own parents who instruct him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Client who is not a fully competent adult</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     By its terms, r 46 of the Rules assumes
                    that the client is one to whom independent advice would be of some utility. This
                    presupposes a client who is capable of making decisions for herself in a
                    rational manner. In our view, this means that where the client is not, or does
                    not appear to be, such a fully competent adult, even more stringent obligations
                    must apply. To quote Fletcher Moulton LJ in <em>Coomber</em> at 730:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a man takes upon himself the responsibility of advising those who are
                        not adults, who are not persons capable of managing their own affairs in the
                        broadest sense of the word, other conditions may arise ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There, the judge was alluding to additional obligations which might be
                    imposed on the solicitor purporting to render independent advice; but equally,
                    or <em>a fortiori</em>, if the advocate and solicitor to
                    whom the gift is intended wishes to avail himself of the apparent generosity of
                    one who is not a fully competent adult, additional obligations must
                    apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Of course, it would be best if the advocate
                    and solicitor declines entirely to retain the intended gift or any part of it.
                    On the other hand, if he wishes to retain it, he does not discharge his ethical
                    duty merely by complying with the letter of r 46 of the Rules, however
                    comprehensive the independent advice received by the client might be. Extra
                    steps will have to be taken, and what those extra steps are will depend on the
                    circumstances of the case. If, for example, the client is one with a history of
                    mental health problems, the advocate and solicitor must at least ensure that she
                    undergoes proper psychiatric evaluation to certify her ability to understand the
                    nature and effect of what she is doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Civil consequences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We emphasise that it will always be preferable
                    for advocates and solicitors to decline to accept gifts from clients, unless the
                    value of the gift is insignificant both in absolute terms and relative to the
                    client’s means. This is because, even if the advocate and solicitor can
                    show that he fulfilled his ethical duties under r 46 of the Rules, the gift
                    may nevertheless be liable to be set aside. We do not intend here to discuss at
                    any length the law on setting aside gifts for undue influence. Suffice to say,
                    in <em>Wright</em>, Stirling LJ echoed
                    Lord Eldon’s statement in an earlier case that it was “almost
                    impossible” to uphold a gift to a solicitor from his client (at 57); in
                        <em>Etridge</em>, Lord Nicholls said that the
                    donor of a gift may “understand fully the implications of a proposed
                    transaction, for instance, a substantial gift, and yet still be acting under the
                    undue influence of another” (at [20]), which would vitiate the gift. Take
                    the example of a client with a history of mental health problems. If an advocate
                    and solicitor refuses to act for her, sends her for psychiatric evaluation,
                    obtains certification of her fitness to understand what she is doing and to
                    manage her own affairs, and refers her to an independent and qualified third
                    party for advice, he may well have fulfilled his ethical duties as an advocate
                    and solicitor, and hence not be liable to disciplinary sanction. Yet it does not
                    follow that, if the client subsequently applies to set aside the gift, the court
                    will necessarily hold that he is entitled to retain the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relationship with the rule prohibiting purchase of client’s
                assets at an undervalue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is worth noting that there may be some
                    overlap between rr 45 and 46 of the Rules. Under r 45, an advocate and
                    solicitor may purchase goods and assets from his client only at the prevailing
                    market price or at a reasonable price. He is prohibited, in other words, from
                    purchasing those goods or assets at an undervalue. However, it is possible to
                    re-conceptualise a purchase at an undervalue as a purchase at fair value
                    together with a gift of a refund of part of the purchase price. Hence, if the
                    purchase is at a significant undervalue, it may be caught by r 46 as well
                    as r 45.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We turn now to the facts of the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The respondent was an advocate and solicitor
                    who practised as sole proprietor under the name M/s James Wan &amp; Co. He
                    was admitted to the Singapore Bar on 14 October 1970. In the matter out of
                    which these disciplinary proceedings arose, the respondent’s client was
                    Madam Chiang Choy Peng (“Mdm Chiang”). She was born on
                    13 March 1939.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Chiang’s background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mdm Chiang became the owner of 18 Maria
                    Avenue, Singapore 456749 (“the Property”) on 27 January 1961.
                    Unfortunately, years later, she was found wandering in the streets. She was
                    referred to Woodbridge Hospital and treated there for schizophrenia. Having
                    improved with treatment, she was discharged and admitted to the Woodlands Home
                    for the Aged<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> (“the Woodlands Home”) on
                    11 March 1980. When the Woodlands Home was closed on 28 April 1997,
                    she was transferred to the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 6 May 1999, the Singapore Land
                    Registry (“the Registry”) wrote to Mdm Chiang naming her as
                    the owner of the Property, and requesting that she verify her identity for
                    purposes of conversion to the new system of land registration<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    The then-Superintendent of the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged, Mr Yeo Lee
                    Hock (“Yeo”), helped her to respond, and on 28 April 2000 the
                    Registry wrote again to Mdm Chiang informing her that a Certificate of
                    Title over the Property had been issued in her name<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. They also
                    informed her that, in order to collect this Certificate of Title, she had to
                    produce her National Registration Identity Card and the original Deed of
                    Conveyance. Mdm Chiang was unable to locate the Deed of
                Conveyance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent gets involved</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The respondent’s involvement began
                    sometime in March 2001, when Yeo asked him to act for Mdm Chiang. Both Yeo
                    and the respondent at the material time worshipped at Paya Lebar Methodist
                    Church. According to Yeo’s file note, he and Mdm Chiang met the
                    respondent on 17 April 2001<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. That same day,
                    Mdm Chiang made a statutory declaration that she had lost or misplaced the Deed
                    of Conveyance<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Regarding Mdm Chiang’s
                    mental fitness to make this statutory declaration, in a letter from the
                    Institute of Mental Health (“the IMH”) dated 11 June 2001,
                    Dr Eu Pui Wai, consultant psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, expressed
                    his opinion that Mdm Chiang was “mentally fit and capable of making
                    a Statutory Declaration declaring the loss of a deed of
                        Conveyance”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. This letter was addressed to the
                    respondent, and was stated to be a response to his “request for a
                    psychiatric report” on Mdm Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent instructs Lee Chin Seon</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At some point in time, either when he was
                    first briefed by Yeo or thereafter, the respondent became aware that the
                    Property was occupied. On 23 April 2001, the respondent wrote to these
                    occupiers demanding delivery of vacant possession. Their solicitors wrote back
                    on 30 May 2001 conveying the occupiers’ intention to claim adverse
                    possession of the Property. The respondent proceeded to brief another advocate
                    and solicitor, Mr Lee Chin Seon (“Lee”), on
                    Mdm Chiang’s case. It appears that the respondent and Lee had a
                    working relationship. The respondent explained that he did so because the matter
                    was becoming litigious, and he did not handle such litigious matters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. Lee
                    proceeded to take instructions directly from Mdm Chiang.</p>

                    instructions” to execute a Power of Attorney in favour of the respondent,
                    even though she had children of her own. The letter further noted her
                    instructions to “dispense with efforts to trace [the] present
                    whereabouts” of her children, their whereabouts being unknown to her. On
                    5 July 2001, Lee drew up, and Mdm Chiang signed, a Power of Attorney
                    giving the respondent a substantial degree of authority to manage her
                        affairs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In a letter to Mdm Chiang

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mdm Chiang’s Will</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the same letter of 6 July 2001, Lee
                    noted Mdm Chiang’s “firm instructions” to
                    “execute a Last Will and Testament” naming the respondent as sole
                    trustee and beneficiary, “with specific instructions to exclude [her]
                    children from any distribution from [her] estate”. On 17 July 2001,
                    Lee drew up, and Mdm Chiang signed, a will making the respondent the sole
                    trustee and beneficiary of all her assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> (“the

                    previous day. He also informed her that, “[a]s discussed”, the
                    Will “would only take effect upon [her] demise”, and that she
                    could revoke it at any time without seeking the consent of the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale of the Property and Mdm Chiang’s making of the
                gift</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Sometime in October 2001, Lee recovered vacant
                    possession of the Property on behalf of Mdm Chiang without litigation. On
                    26 October 2001, the respondent requested for a valuation of the Property
                    from Colliers Jardine Consultation &amp; Valuation (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“Colliers Jardine”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. On
                    2 November 2001, he received a valuation report valuing the Property at
                        $1,100,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. On 15 November 2001,
                    Mdm Chiang met the respondent at his office. According to the respondent,
                    he sent for her so that he could explain the valuation report to her<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. During this meeting on
                    15 November 2001, Mdm Chiang signed a letter (“the Gift
                    Letter”) drafted by the respondent, purportedly on her
                        instructions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>, stating that she
                    wished only to keep $500,000 out of the proceeds of the sale of the Property,
                    and that the respondent could keep any amount in excess of that sum<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.
                    Yeo witnessed, or purported to witness, the signing of the letter. The Gift
                    Letter is a critical document in this case, and hence it will be set out in full
                    at [58] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The respondent went on to make arrangements
                    for the sale of the Property. On 25 November 2001, he engaged yet another
                    advocate and solicitor, Mr Victor Yip Keng Fook (“Yip”) of
                    M/s Teh Yip Wong &amp; Tan, to handle legal matters pertaining to the sale
                    of the Property<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. On 3 December 2001, an option
                    signed by Mdm Chiang was given for the sale of the Property at
                        $960,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The signing of the option was
                    witnessed by Yip. On 6 December 2001, Yip paid over the option fee of
                    $9,600 to the respondent by cheque<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. On
                    19 December 2001, upon the exercise of the option by the purchaser of the
                    Property, Yip paid over $86,400 to the respondent, also by cheque<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Completion of the sale of the Property took
                    place on 27 February 2002, and three separate cheques for a total of
                    $862,224.63 were issued in the respondent’s favour<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. On the same day, Yip received a letter
                    signed by Mdm Chiang instructing that all correspondence meant for her be
                    directed to the respondent instead, the stated reason being that she was leaving
                    the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. It is unclear
                    who prepared this letter. On 6 March 2002, the respondent issued a cheque
                    for $500,000 in Mdm Chiang’s favour<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Investigation and complaint</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The unusual nature of this gift only
                    fortuitously came to light in 2009, when the Auditor-General’s Office
                    audited the books of the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged and found that
                    Mdm Chiang had only received $500,000 despite the Property having been sold
                    at $960,000. This led to an investigation by the Commercial Affairs Division.
                    The police forwarded a summary of their investigations to the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers, which then made a complaint to the Law
                    Society against the respondent. This led to the present disciplinary
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Before the Disciplinary Tribunal (“the
                    DT”), the respondent pleaded guilty to a breach of r 46 of the
                    Rules. The only matter that remained to be resolved was that of mitigation. As
                    counsel for the Law Society and counsel for the respondent could not agree on
                    the facts stated in the respondent’s written mitigation, it was agreed
                    that the DT would hear evidence and make findings of fact, in what counsel for
                    the respondent described as a “Newton style hearing”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. In the proceedings before the DT, the
                    Law Society called one witness, Mdm Chiang, while counsel for the
                    respondent called four witnesses, namely (and in order), the respondent himself,
                    Yeo, Yip and Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There were two agreed issues of fact in
                    dispute before the DT, as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did Mdm Chiang know of the
                        valuation of the Property at $1,100,000?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did she know that the Property was sold for
                        $960,000?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the report of the DT (“the
                    DT Report”), the DT returned a negative answer to both
                        questions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. The DT then concluded that,
                    although the respondent’s involvement might have started off as an act of
                    charity towards Mdm Chiang, this eventually became a case in which the
                    respondent “manipulated” an “apparently indigent old lady,
                    a former Woodbridge Hospital patient”. The DT further expressed the view
                    that the respondent’s engaging Yip to handle the sale of the Property was
                    “obviously done as a smoke screen to cover up the [respondent’s]
                    role in the sale”. As a result, the DT determined that cause of
                    sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the
                        Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Before us, the Law Society simply adopted the
                    findings in the DT Report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The respondent, on the other hand, disputed
                    the DT’s findings on the two agreed issues of fact. He disputed the
                    DT’s conclusion that he had manipulated Mdm Chiang, maintaining
                    instead that this case involved no more than an “accidental
                    lapse”, or “oversight”, or
                        “omission”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. On this basis, the respondent’s position
                    was that no action should be taken under s 83 of the Act, but that, if it
                    was held that “due cause” under s 83 had been shown, then a
                    “nominal penalty” would suffice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The respondent’s arguments may be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Chiang’s evidence
                        before the DT cannot be relied upon because of the incompleteness and
                        inaccuracy of her memory. This is shown by her inability to recall a number
                        of events and circumstances which are substantiated by other evidence. Among
                        other things, Mdm Chiang could not recall having made the Will before
                        Lee, she could not recall having met Yip at all, and she had difficulty
                        recognising the respondent when he was pointed out to her while she gave her
                            evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     The DT ignored Mdm Chiang’s concession during
                        cross-examination that she had seen a copy of the valuation
                            report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     The DT ignored Yip’s evidence that he had informed
                        Mdm Chiang that the Property was being sold for $960,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues for determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We had to determine two issues. First, was the
                    respondent’s breach of r 46 of the Rules tainted with dishonesty, as
                    the DT Report concluded? Second, what would be the appropriate sanction
                    under s 83 of the Act, if any, to impose on the respondent?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the respondent was dishonest</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The standard of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In Singapore, recent decisions of this Court
                    have affirmed the position that the criminal standard of proof applies in
                    disciplinary proceedings against advocates and solicitors: see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena</em> [2013]
                    SGHC 5 at [28]; <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis
                        bin Abdul Ghani</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [6]. This is also the
                    position adopted in England: see the Privy Council case (on appeal from Trinidad
                    and Tobago) of <em>Campbell v Hamlet</em> [2005] 3 All
                    ER 1116 at [16]–[21]. Where, as in this case, it is not disputed that
                    there has been a breach of the Rules, and the issue is simply whether the breach
                    was tainted with dishonesty, the criminal standard of proof would mean that, if
                    the respondent is to be punished on the basis that he was dishonest, his
                    dishonesty must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, there are jurisdictions which instead
                    apply the civil standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings against legal
                    professionals. In Australia, see for example the New South Wales Supreme Court
                    case of <em>Jackson (previously known as Subramaniam) v Legal
                        Practitioners Admission Board</em> 2006 NSWSC 1338 at [35] and the
                    Victoria Supreme Court case of <em>Re The Legal Profession Act
                        2004 and Re OG, a Lawyer</em> 2007 VSC 520 at [99]. In Hong Kong, this
                    was the unanimous holding of the Court of Final Appeal in <em>A
                        Solicitor v The Law Society of Hong Kong</em> [2008] HKCU 393 at
                    [116]. The civil standard of proof can be expressed as “preponderance of
                    probability” or “balance of probability”, the terms having
                    been used interchangeably by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <em>In re H and others (minors) (sexual abuse: standard of proof)</em>
                    [1996] AC 563. It is capable of a high degree of nuance in the sense that,
                    notwithstanding that a single standard of proof is applied, the strength of
                    evidence needed to prove a particular allegation may nevertheless vary according
                    to the seriousness or gravity of that allegation. In the words of Lord Nicholls
                    at 586:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a
                        factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the
                        more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred
                        and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes
                        that the allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is
                        usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is usually
                        less likely than accidental physical injury. A stepfather is usually less
                        likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his
                        under age stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and
                        slapped her. Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a
                        generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the
                        allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a
                        serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It
                        means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is
                        itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and
                        deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the
                        event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the
                        balance of probability, its occurrence will be established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Might it then be argued that this nuanced
                    civil standard of proof, rather than the criminal standard, should apply in
                    disciplinary proceedings in Singapore? Of course, no such argument was made
                    before us, and a disposal of the present case does not require a decision on
                    this point because, even on the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable
                    doubt, we found that the respondent had been dishonest. Given these
                    considerations, it would not be appropriate to decide on this point here without
                    the benefit of proper argument; as such, we flag this important issue for closer
                    consideration in a future appropriate matter. That said, we would venture some
                    observations, the conclusion of which is that the criminal standard of proof
                    should continue to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The first observation is that, where the
                    allegations against an advocate and solicitor are of a very serious nature,
                    there is likely to be little practical difference between the civil and criminal
                    standards of proof: see the remark of Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ in
                        <em>B v Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset
                        Constabulary</em> [2001] 1 WLR 340 at [31]. The more serious the
                    allegation, the less likely it is that the allegation is true, and the stronger
                    the evidence required to prove it; where the allegation is very serious,
                    therefore, the evidence required to prove it on a balance of probability might
                    be so strong as to pass muster even on the criminal standard of proof beyond a
                    reasonable doubt. The question of the standard of proof is likely to be most
                    hotly-contested in cases where the allegations are of greater seriousness, but
                    it is in precisely those cases that the question is most academic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The second observation is that the criminal
                    standard of proof also allows a degree of flexibility in its operation, and is
                    in that regard not much inferior, if at all, to the civil standard. That is to
                    say, the strength of evidence required to remove all reasonable doubt may also
                    vary according to the gravity or seriousness of the allegations to be proved.
                    Compare, for example, an allegation of insurance fraud with an allegation of
                    murder motivated by a desire to receive insurance monies paid out as a result of
                    the victim’s death. Proof that the accused purchased an insurance policy
                    the day before some inexplicable property damage might suffice to prove, beyond
                    a reasonable doubt, the former allegation. However, proof that the accused
                    purchased a policy insuring the victim’s life the day before the
                    victim’s inexplicable death might not similarly prove, beyond a reasonable
                    doubt, the latter allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The third and final observation is that
                    disciplinary proceedings are more akin to criminal than civil proceedings in one
                    important respect, which is that, like criminal proceedings, the whole purpose
                    or object of disciplinary proceedings is to make judgments about a
                    person’s conduct and/or character. Similar judgments may occur in civil
                    proceedings – for instance, a defendant might be found to have been
                    “fraudulent” or “dishonest” – but the
                    difference is that it is not the purpose or object of civil proceedings to make
                    such judgments. Rather, the purpose of civil proceedings is, broadly speaking,
                    to compel or prohibit persons from doing certain thing(s) <em>vis-a-vis</em> another person, <em>eg</em>, to
                    pay an amount of money. Any judgments as to a person’s conduct or
                    character in civil proceedings are purely corollary or incidental to that main
                    purpose – a person is labelled “dishonest” not for its own
                    sake, but so that the person may be ordered to compensate another person. By
                    contrast, in criminal and disciplinary proceedings, a person is labelled
                    “dishonest” for its own sake, <em>ie</em>, so
                    that the community will be put on notice that this is a dishonest person (or a
                    person whose specific conduct, whether positive act or omission, was dishonest).
                    Hence, the criminal standard of proof is perhaps more appropriate than the civil
                    standard in disciplinary proceedings because it sends the moral message that, if
                    a person’s conduct or character is to be judged for professional fitness,
                    it may only be judged if the highest standard of proof has been
                reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Accordingly, we needed to be satisfied beyond
                    a reasonable doubt that the respondent had been dishonest in order to sanction
                    him on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DT Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As mentioned at [42] above, the Law Society
                    simply adopted the findings of the DT Report, and did not offer any
                    additional arguments to support its position that the respondent had been
                    dishonest. This was unfortunate, because in our view, the DT Report did not
                    provide sufficient grounds for finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the
                    respondent had been dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     To begin with, the DT Report contains two
                    misinterpretations in its evaluation of the evidence. The first can be found at
                    [34] of the DT Report, where the DT quoted an excerpt from Yeo’s
                    evidence as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Did you know at the time when this document was
                            signed on 15<sup>th</sup> November that a valuation [by

                            that the valuation had been obtained and how much that valuation
                            show?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I don’t know whether the lawyer tells her or

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">On what occasion would the valuation be
                            mentioned?</span></p>

                            sometime they will just say, ‘Eh, this---this building going to

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So it did not refer to a valuation obtained but

<p class="Judg-1">The DT said at [34] that this excerpt from Yeo’s evidence
                    “suggests that Mdm Chiang was not aware of the valuation”.
                    However, with respect, we could not see how this excerpt suggests that. All that
                    this excerpt says is that Yeo did not, and could not, know whether or not the
                    respondent had apprised Mdm Chiang of the valuation, and that Yeo himself
                    was not aware that a valuation report had been obtained. It does not necessarily
                    follow from this that Mdm Chiang was similarly unaware of the
                valuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The second instance can be found at
                    [37]–[38] of the DT Report. The DT quoted at [37] the following
                    excerpt of Mdm Chiang’s cross-examination by counsel for the
                    respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now you---I put it to you that you saw this in
                            Mr James Wan’s office when Mr James---when this report
                            was prepared, Mr James Wan asked you to go down to his office and
                            you went down with madam---with Mr Yeo. And it was at that meeting
                            that Mr Wan showed you the valuation report. Do you remember
                            this?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I can’t recall.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... And Mr James Wan had told you that the
                            valuation---according to the valuation report, it was the property---the
                            value of the property was about $1.1 million.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I can’t recall.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now at that time you were so happy to get the
                            property back and you were going to get some money. You told Mr Wan
                            that you only needed $500,000. Mr Wan can sell the property and
                            anything over $500,000 he can keep so long as Mr Wan pays himself,
                            pays the lawyer’s bills, pays the---the---the agent---the
                            agent’s bills, pays the valuer’s bills. ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did not say so much things.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DT went on to say at [38] that the respondent’s case as
                    suggested by counsel in the above excerpt was inconsistent with the
                    respondent’s own evidence under cross-examination by counsel for the Law
                    Society in the following excerpt:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... I put it to you that you did not inform
                            Mdm Chiang that the sale price of the property was $960,000.
                            ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s not true.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And why is that not true?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I spoke---I relay the message through
                            Mr Richard Yeo [referring to Mr Yeo] whom I always
                            com---communicate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... do you know whether Mr Yeo did or did not
                            convey what you told him to do?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I believe Mr Yeo would have conveyed to him
                            [sic].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, we could not see where the inconsistency lies. In
                    the former excerpt, the respondent’s case as suggested by counsel was that
                    he had personally informed Mdm Chiang of the Property’s valuation at
                    $1,100,000. In the latter excerpt, the respondent’s evidence was that he
                    had conveyed the Property’s selling price of $960,000 to Mdm Chiang
                    through an intermediary, that is, Yeo. One excerpt pertains to the manner in
                    which Mdm Chiang was informed of the <em>valuation</em>, while the other excerpt pertains to the manner in
                    which she was informed of the <em>selling price</em>.
                    Therefore, we did not think that there was any material inconsistency between
                    the two excerpts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The evaluation of evidence spans just seven
                    paragraphs at [34]–[40], and the bulk of the text consists of quotations
                    from the transcript of proceedings before the DT, which means that the
                    DT’s own reasoning was fairly sparse. Given all this, it would be unsafe
                    to find that the respondent was dishonest on the basis of the DT Report
                    alone, as the Law Society, in effect, urged us to do. Plainly, the DT must have
                    thought that this was an obvious case of dishonesty, and that the facts would
                    speak for themselves. In the final analysis, we agreed with the DT’s
                    conclusion, although this agreement followed our own detailed evaluation of the
                    evidence. We now turn to this evaluation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evaluation of the evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The valuation report and the 15 November 2001 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As narrated above at [36] above, the
                    respondent requested for a valuation report from Colliers Jardine on
                    26 October 2001. A week later, he received that report valuing the Property
                    at $1,100,000. On 15 November 2001, about two weeks after receiving the
                    report, he met Mdm Chiang at his office. On his own evidence, he was the
                    one who called for the meeting in order to explain the valuation report to her.
                    However, Mdm Chiang said in her evidence that she could not recall having
                    been informed of the valuation of the Property<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. We

                    to the respondent’s word against Mdm Chiang’s. However, this is
                    not the case. The meeting of 15 November 2001 produced a document, namely,
                    the Gift Letter. The respondent’s evidence is that he drafted this letter,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Sirs</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Re: No. 18 Maria Avenue Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wish to thank you for helping me to recover [the Property].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the fact that the house is in a dilapidated condition and that
                        a large portion of the land at the back is on a slope of about 60 feet
                        higher than the front and also due to the slump in the property market in
                        Singapore I’m agreeable and confirm to accept as full payment to me a
                        sum of Dollars Five hundred thousand only ($500,000.00) if you can manage to
                        sell it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since you have not charged me for your legal fees. I hereby agree and
                        confirm that you may keep any amount above $500,000.00 as a reward for
                        helping me in recovering No. 18 Maria Avenue which I had little hope of
                        getting it back since it has been occupied by some strangers for more than
                        20 odd years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are also responsible to clean the house and pay the arrears of
                        property tax or other relevant fees including housing agents’ fees in
                        selling the property and [Lee’s] legal fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the second paragraph, the opening words
                    “[i]n view of” indicate a causal connection between, on one hand,
                    the Property’s disadvantageous characteristics and the property market
                    slump, and, on the other, Mdm Chiang’s willingness to accept just
                    $500,000 from the sale proceeds as full payment. Making explicit this unsaid
                    causal connection, the full line of reasoning proceeds thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     ‘In view of the
                        Property’s disadvantageous characteristics and the property market
                        slump, I am not hopeful of getting a good price for the Property, perhaps
                        not very much more than $500,000, and therefore I am willing to accept just
                        $500,000 from the sale proceeds’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We concluded from
                    this that the Gift Letter unequivocally records Mdm Chiang’s belief that
                    the sale of the Property would fetch a sum barely in the excess of $500,000. As
                    such, the Gift Letter strongly suggests that the respondent did not, in fact,
                    inform Mdm Chiang that the Property had been valued at
                $1,100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     However, the respondent’s case is that
                    he did show Mdm Chiang the valuation report, except that he informed her
                    thereafter “that the Property was unlikely to fetch S$1.1 million
                    because it was in a dilapidated condition”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.
                    This was the position taken in a letter dated 16 June 2011 from counsel for
                    the respondent to the Inquiry Committee constituted under s 85(10) of the
                    Act to investigate the complaint against the respondent. The respondent further
                    claimed in evidence that, although he had the valuation report in hand, he
                    nonetheless believed that the sale of the Property would fetch less than
                        $1,100,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. The
                    respondent’s defence, in other words, is that he told Mdm Chiang to
                    expect the selling price of the Property to fall significantly short of the
                    valuation, and that he himself honestly believed this to be the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     However, we did not believe that the
                    respondent honestly expected that the Property’s selling price would fall
                    significantly short of the valuation. His own evidence, concerning the events
                    leading up to the sale of the Property, establishes that he did not hold such an
                    expectation. An excerpt from his testimony on being cross-examined by counsel
                    for the Law Society speaks for itself<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>:</p>

                                            offered---advertised again the third time. Then this
                                            agent came back---came to me, say, “I’m so

                                            buy?” He gave me about 800 over thousand dollars.
                                                <em>I told him, “The valuation
                                                is 1.1. You have to---you know, I can’t sell
                                                you at that price.”</em> So I think a
                                            couple of days back or a couple of days later, he called
                                            me back, you know. <em>He offered 900. I
                                                said, “Cannot. I won’t be able---I
                                                won’t sell.”</em> So this thing
                                            went on a few more days. Then he came back, offered 960,
                                            you know. Then over this period of time I was thinking I
                                            have appointed two agent. None of them came back with
                                            any offer at all. I advertised three times. This is the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the respondent’s own case, he
                    represented to Mdm Chiang that the Property was unlikely to fetch
                    $1,100,000. On the basis of the Gift Letter, he must have represented to her
                    that it would not fetch much more than $500,000. Since his own belief was that
                    he could get a selling price which was at least close to $1,100,000, he must
                    have made those representations without an honest belief in the truth of their
                    contents. This means that he must have positively misled Mdm Chiang as to
                    the expected selling price of the Property, so that she would be willing to keep
                    just $500,000 and make a gift of the remainder of the sale proceeds to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In light of the foregoing analysis, simply by

                    respondent and Mdm Chiang as evidenced by the Gift Letter, we had no doubt
                    that the respondent was plainly dishonest. The respondent believed, on the basis
                    of the valuation report which he had requested, that the sale of the Property
                    would fetch a sum in the region of $1,100,000. Yet, it is clear from the Gift
                    Letter that Mdm Chiang believed that the sale of the Property would fetch
                    little more than $500,000. On that basis, she was willing to make a gift to the
                    respondent of all the sale proceeds in excess of that amount. We saw just two
                    possible explanations for this state of affairs: either he kept the valuation
                    report from her, or he showed her the report but represented to her, contrary to
                    his own belief, that the valuation was not an accurate reflection of the
                    expected selling price. Either way, the only inference we could draw was that,
                    at the meeting of 15 November 2001, the respondent misled Mdm Chiang
                    into believing that the Property’s selling price would barely exceed
                    $500,000, so as to induce her into making a gift to him of all the sale proceeds
                    above $500,000. This sufficed to satisfy us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
                    respondent was dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lack of attendance notes from the 15 November 2001
                meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     At this juncture, we wish to highlight the
                    respondent’s failure to take any attendance notes at the 15 November
                    2001 meeting with Mdm Chiang or, indeed, at anytime. We do so in order to
                    emphasise, as we have done so before, that it is an exercise in precaution and
                    prudence to maintain contemporaneous attendance notes, even in routine matters:
                        <em>Lie Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim (a
                        firm)</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 594 at [71]. While it is
                    uncontroversial that a failure to maintain attendance notes is not a breach of
                    an advocate and solicitor’s professional duties <em>per
                        se</em>, it is well-established that the lack of attendance notes may
                    lead to adverse inferences being drawn against the advocate and solicitor who
                    fails to keep these attendance notes: see the decision of this court in
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [82], [85]. Such adverse inferences may be drawn
                    against an advocate and solicitor not only in disciplinary proceedings, but also
                    in civil proceedings where he is a witness, including civil proceedings to which
                    he is not a party: see the Court of Appeal decision <em>Low Ah
                        Cheow and others v Ng Hock Guan</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at
                    [38]–[40].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the present case, we did not hesitate to
                    draw an adverse inference against the respondent from his failure to keep
                    attendance notes of the 15 November 2001 meeting. This inference was that,
                    contrary to what he claimed, he had not in fact apprised Mdm Chiang of the
                    valuation of the Property at that meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Looking at the evidence in totality, our view
                    as to the respondent’s dishonesty was further reinforced. As we put to
                    counsel for the respondent when he appeared before us, there were only two
                    possible characterisations of the respondent’s conduct: either it was
                    utterly incompetent, or it was manipulative and therefore dishonest. It could
                    not have been incompetence, because this would be incompetence of an
                    extraordinary scale that we could not reasonably attribute to a senior member of
                    the legal profession. We would have difficulty believing that the greenest of
                    advocates and solicitors could be capable of such incompetence, let alone an
                    advocate and solicitor of over 30 years’ standing, as the respondent was
                    at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     We turn now to consider the rest of the
                    evidence from which we drew our inferences of the respondent’s deplorable
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mdm Chiang’s mental health</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mdm Chiang’s history of mental
                    health problems is undoubted. On the respondent’s own evidence, he was
                    aware of this from around the time that he met her, which would have been around
                    April 2001<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. His knowledge of
                    her mental health history prompted him to request for a psychiatric report from
                    IMH. Subsequently, however, when Mdm Chiang made him the gift of the
                    Property’s sale proceeds less $500,000, he took no such precautionary
                    steps. He knew that, the Property having been valued at $1,100,000, she might be
                    giving away as much as $600,000. Further, he was aware that the IMH report,
                    which certified her fitness to execute a statutory declaration, was confined
                    merely to Mdm Chiang’s fitness <em>to execute a
                        statutory declaration</em> to receive a title document pertaining to
                    property belonging to her. He must have known that her fitness <em>to give away potentially $600,000</em> was an entirely
                    different matter. From the report, he would further have been aware that she
                    continued to receive “maintenance anti-psychotic medication, thioridazine
                    50 mg ON”, meaning that, although the IMH report stated that she was
                    “in remission of her mental illness”, she had by no means fully
                    recovered, and there remained the risk of her mental difficulties overwhelming
                    her once more. Despite all this, he made no attempt to confirm
                    Mdm Chiang’s mental fitness to make such a significant gift and refer
                    her to an independent third party for advice. He simply accepted the purported
                    gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The respondent argued that Mdm Chiang
                    appeared to him, and to everyone else, to be mentally healthy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. He further argued that
                    Mdm Chiang had been very insistent that he accept the gift<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. However, notwithstanding this
                    assertion, it was clear to us that any reasonable advocate and solicitor in the
                    respondent’s position would have been far more circumspect. After all, the
                    respondent stood to receive as much as $600,000, which would have been even more
                    than the $500,000 she was getting. It is inconceivable that an advocate and
                    solicitor with as many years’ experience as the respondent could have
                    overlooked the need to take any precautions at all in relation to ascertaining
                    Mdm Chiang’s mental health and her capacity to make a gift as
                    distinct from receiving a benefit. Even if the gift was a free exercise of
                    Mdm Chiang’s will, it is implausible that his failure to send her for
                    psychiatric re-evaluation, and to refer her to an independent third party for
                    advice, could have been a mere “accidental lapse” or
                    “oversight” or “omission”. We found his claim that
                    the need for these precautions simply “slipped [his] mind” –
                    that it was but an “error of [his] judgment”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> – to be teetering on the edge of
                    absurdity. Having immense difficulty in believing that the respondent was guilty
                    only of incompetence – however grave that incompetence might be – we
                    were constrained to find that something rather more sinister was
                afoot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Power of Attorney</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Power of Attorney executed by
                    Mdm Chiang granted the respondent very extensive powers to manage
                    Mdm Chiang’s affairs. We set out just a few of these powers to
                    provide an idea of how extensive they were:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Mdm Chiang requested the respondent’s
                    assistance in recovering and selling the Property. It may have made sense for
                    her to grant him powers to facilitate his performance of that request, but the
                    powers in this Power of Attorney clearly went beyond that. Indeed, many of the
                    powers therein, such as those listed in this excerpt, were not powers in
                    relation to the Property at all. Rather, they were powers to purchase other
                    properties – including even the power to apply Mdm Chiang’s CPF
                    monies, which would otherwise be used to support her in her old age, towards the
                    purchase of those properties – and subsequently to deal with these
                    purchased properties. We found it disturbing that so wide a Power of Attorney
                    was drawn up by Lee in response to what was a fairly limited request by
                    Mdm Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Granted, the respondent might not have been
                    involved in the execution of the Power of Attorney, because it appears that Lee
                    drew up the document for Mdm Chiang. We were willing to give him the
                    benefit of the doubt that the Power of Attorney was executed without his
                    prompting, as he says it was<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. Yet the respondent did not deny that the
                    document was subsequently brought to his attention<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. The evidence does not indicate exactly when
                    it was brought to his attention, but it could not have been very long after the
                    Power of Attorney was executed. Upon learning that unnecessarily extensive
                    powers had been bestowed upon him, any reasonable advocate and solicitor would
                    have asked questions at once. He would at least have ascertained from
                    Mdm Chiang that she did indeed intend to confer all those powers upon him.
                    Further, he should have advised her that there was no need for such a
                    comprehensive suite of powers for the comparatively simple task of recovering
                    and selling the Property, and that it was possible, if she so desired, to draw
                    up a more restricted Power of Attorney. At the minimum, he ought to have sought
                    confirmation from Lee that Mdm Chiang understood what she was doing. He
                    might have asked for a psychiatric re-evaluation of
                Mdm Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Regrettably, the respondent did nothing. Under
                    cross-examination, he agreed that it was an extensive Power of Attorney, but
                    said that, to him, the Power of Attorney was “an ordinary
                        thing”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, and that “a
                    normal full Power of Attorney includes all these points”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>. He said that the content of the
                    document was a matter “between her and the person who prepare the Power
                    of Attorney”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>. Again, we found it
                    difficult to believe that an advocate and solicitor of the respondent’s
                    experience could have been so remiss as to have done nothing. Once more, we were
                    led towards the conclusion that this indicated something more troubling than
                    mere incompetence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mdm Chiang’s Will</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     We set out here the material portions of the

                            making of this Will and my death, including any assets ... over which I
                            may have a general power of appointment or disposition by Will and which
                            may fall into my estate to be administered ... For the purpose of

                            notwithstanding, I hereby declare and direct that the following persons

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The respondent claimed that he was not aware
                    of the existence and the contents of the Will until it was brought to his
                    attention many years later during police investigations in 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. However, we found it very difficult
                    to credit the respondent with truthfulness in this instance. According to Lee,
                    his bill for all his work done for Mdm Chiang was paid by the
                        respondent<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. Lee also said that
                    he put up a “detailed bill”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. We had no doubt that this “detailed
                    bill” (which was never produced) would have included Lee’s work in
                    drawing up the Will. At the very latest, therefore, the respondent would have
                    known of the existence of the Will when he paid Lee’s bill, which would
                    have been shortly after receiving the proceeds from the sale of the Property. In
                    fact, we had little doubt that the respondent knew about the Will even earlier
                    than that. From the outset, Lee must have expected payment for his services, and
                    he must have looked to the respondent for such payment, given
                    Mdm Chiang’s apparent impecunious state. Consequently, he must have
                    informed the respondent of the services that he rendered to Mdm Chiang. We
                    had little doubt that when Lee apprised the respondent of the existence of the
                    Will, he would also have apprised him of its contents, since it named the
                    respondent as sole trustee and beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Yet even assuming that the respondent only
                    learnt about the Will after receiving the proceeds from the Property’s
                    sale at the end of February 2002, it is striking that he did absolutely nothing
                    about it thereafter. The Will did not merely grant the respondent some share in
                    Mdm Chiang’s assets. On the contrary, not only did it name him as
                    sole beneficiary of all her assets, but it also specifically excluded all her
                    children from any share in those assets. Even though Mdm Chiang might have
                    been very grateful to the respondent for agreeing to help her to recover the
                    Property, any reasonable advocate and solicitor in his position would have
                    thought the response to be somewhat disproportionate to the gratitude. A
                    reasonable advocate and solicitor would, as a result, at least have sought
                    confirmation from Mdm Chiang that her intentions remained as embodied in
                    the Will. He would at least have checked with Lee that Mdm Chiang knew what
                    she was doing. He would then have arranged a psychiatric re-evaluation of her
                    mental fitness to give away, upon her demise, all that she had in the world. An
                    advocate and solicitor would have to be grossly incompetent not to take these
                    basic precautionary measures. Again, we had much difficulty believing that the
                    respondent, with his ample experience, could have been capable of such glaring
                    inadvertence and are led towards the conclusion that, instead, foul play was
                    involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Property’s selling price</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     While the DT addressed the question of whether
                    Mdm Chiang knew that the Property was being sold for $960,000, in our view,
                    the more pertinent question was what steps the respondent took to inform her of
                    the Property’s selling price. On his evidence, he did not at any point
                    attempt to inform Mdm Chiang personally, but instead informed Yeo,
                    intending that Yeo should then convey the message to Mdm Chiang<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. He said further
                    that, having engaged Yip to handle the conveyance of the Property, he assumed
                    that Yip would also have informed her of the Property’s selling
                        price<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Any reasonable advocate and solicitor,
                    however, would have tried to inform Mdm Chiang personally that the Property
                    was going to be sold for $960,000. He would have understood that this was a
                    critical piece of information which Mdm Chiang should be apprised of. And
                    it does not seem to have been too difficult to arrange a personal meeting with
                    Mdm Chiang – after all, the respondent managed to arrange such a
                    meeting on 15 November 2001. We could not fathom why the respondent did not
                    likewise meet Mdm Chiang personally to convey to her the Property’s
                    selling price, but instead went through an intermediary. Once more, we found it
                    very difficult to believe that this was mere incompetency as opposed to a lack
                    of honesty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The respondent’s instruction of Lee and Yip</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It seemed odd to us that there were a total of
                    three advocates and solicitors working on a matter as simple as
                    Mdm Chiang’s as the work could have easily been handled by a single
                    advocate and solicitor. The respondent explained that he instructed Lee because,
                    the occupiers of the Property having claimed adverse possession, the matter was
                    straying into unfamiliar litigious territory which he did not feel able to deal
                    with. His explanation for instructing Yip in the conveyance of the Property was
                    that he wanted to give Yip some business, since Yip had just started his own
                        practice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     We did not find his explanations convincing.
                    In relation to instructing Lee, the curious aspect of his explanation is that,
                    by 2001, the doctrine of adverse possession had already been abolished for
                    around seven years. It could not have afforded the Property’s occupiers
                    any defence to Mdm Chiang’s claim for vacant possession, which means
                    that the dispute would not have gone to litigation. The respondent’s
                    explanation as to why he instructed Yip is even more suspect, because Yip in his
                    evidence flatly rejected that explanation as untrue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">We were therefore unable to see any reason why the respondent
                    instructed Yip instead of handling the conveyance himself apart from the reason
                    offered by the DT that the respondent wanted to get the transaction some
                    distance away from himself so as to hide his involvement in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mdm Chiang’s letter to Yip directing correspondence to the
                respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     On 27 February 2002, the day on which
                    completion of the sale of the Property took place, a letter was sent to
                        Yip<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>, purporting to be from Mdm Chiang. The
                    letter read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please send all correspondences to me to Mr James Wan at
                        the address below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3"><div align="center">60 Albert Street #09-10 Albert Complex Singapore
                            189969</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I shall be leaving this present address.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please do not send any correspondences to my present address
                        forthwith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We were somewhat bewildered by this letter. First, since completion of
                    the sale of the Property had taken place, there seemed to be no prospect of
                    further correspondence being sent to Mdm Chiang. Second, Mdm Chiang
                    did not, in fact, leave the Bukit Batok Home for the Aged until much later,
                    sometime in 2012. It was Yeo who left the Home in December 2001. Keeping the
                    rest of the evidence in mind, we strongly suspected that this letter did not
                    originate from Mdm Chiang, and that the purpose of the letter was to
                    prevent any material incriminating the respondent from coming into
                    Mdm Chiang’s possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our finding on whether the respondent was dishonest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     We did not hesitate to find that the
                    respondent had been dishonest. We would have found him dishonest solely on the
                    basis of what transpired at the 15 November 2001 meeting between him and
                    Mdm Chiang, as evidenced by the contents of the Gift Letter. In addition,
                    the totality of the evidence pointed to his dishonesty. Taken together with a
                    few other suspicious and poorly-explained circumstances, the overall picture
                    that emerged was unambiguously that of manipulation of Mdm Chiang by the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Like the DT, we were of the opinion that in
                    the initial stages, the respondent might have become involved out of a sense of
                    charity towards Mdm Chiang. However, we had no doubt that this charity
                    subsequently gave way to a desire to enrich himself financially at her expense
                    by taking advantage of her mental frailty and lack of sophistication to secure
                    almost half of the proceeds from the sale of the Property, as well as
                    entitlement to all her assets upon her demise. We do not make any findings on
                    the extent to which Lee and Yip were involved in the respondent’s
                    manipulation of Mdm Chiang, if at all, because those issues were not before
                    us. Be that as it may, we feel constrained to observe that the conduct of Lee,
                    at least, raised serious questions calling for an explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Having found that the respondent was dishonest
                    in breaching r 46 of the Rules, we were of the view that he was no longer fit to
                    practise as an advocate and solicitor. Accordingly, we ordered that he be struck
                    off the roll. We also awarded costs to the Law Society on a standard basis, to
                    be taxed if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     We conclude by emphasising that an advocate
                    and solicitor who receives a significant gift from a client should be aware
                    that the circumstances in which a gift is made will attract intense and detailed
                    scrutiny if and when the propriety of the gift comes into issue. Prudent
                    advocates and solicitors should therefore shun situations where even the
                    appearance of having taken advantage of a client may later be called into
                    question. It is only through close adherence to both the letter and spirit of
                    the stipulated ethical constraints that legitimate concerns relating to the
                    receipt of significant gifts may be dissolved.</p>
