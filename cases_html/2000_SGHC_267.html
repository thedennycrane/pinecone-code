<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><u>THE CHARGES</u></p>
<p align="justify">1 The Accused is now 32 years old. He was working as a deliveryman for

Kentucky Fried Chicken. He faced a total of 23 Charges under Section 377 of the Penal Code

alleging that he had carnal intercourse against the order of nature by performing fellatio

on eight boys ranging in age between 12 and 14 years old at various times in his HDB flat.

Eight Charges, each involving a different boy, were proceeded with. The Accused pleaded

guilty to these eight Charges and admitted and consented to the remaining 15 Charges being

taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">2 He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on each of the eight

Charges, with four of the sentences running consecutively with effect from 22 June 2000

(the date he was arrested). The victims in these four consecutive sentences were all below

14 years of age at the material times. The remaining four sentences were ordered to run

concurrently with the four consecutive sentences, making a total of 40 years imprisonment.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify">THE FACTS</p>
<p align="justify">3 In January 1997, the Accused became acquainted with Victim 6 who was

playing street soccer at a Street Soccer Court. In July that year, the Accused told Victim

6 that he was looking for a place to live in and asked whether he could stay in Victim

6’s flat. Victim 6 approached his mother who agreed to the Accused moving into the

flat and paying a monthly rent of between $150 to $200.</p>
<p align="justify">4 Sometime in the beginning of 1999, the Accused moved out of that flat

after a quarrel between him and the brother of Victim 6. He then moved into his present

flat where all the offences took place.</p>
<p align="justify">5 Victim 6 would go to the Accused’s flat regularly to play video

games on the Accused’s Sony Play Station. Occasionally, he would also deliver food

that his mother had prepared for the Accused. He would spend most of his time in the

Accused’s flat and even had a spare key to let himself in.</p>
<p align="justify">6 The Accused met the rest of the victims at the Street Soccer Court

through the introduction of Victim 6 who referred to him as Uncle. He would invite the

boys to his flat to play video games. In June 2000, they also assembled in his flat to

watch the Euro 2000 soccer competition.</p>
<p align="justify">7 The Accused would accost the victims when they were alone in his

flat. He would proceed or continue to suck the penis of the respective victims despite

their mild protests. In some cases, the victims were too afraid or too shocked to resist.

They did not tell anyone about the incidents. On one occasion, he accosted Victim 7 in the

kitchen of the flat while some of the other boys were playing the video games elsewhere in

the flat. He pulled down Victim 7’s shorts when the latter emerged from the toilet in

the kitchen and proceeded to suck his penis, stopping only when the victim shouted

"Jangan" (or "Don’t"). Victim 7 returned to join the others

without telling them about the incident in the kitchen.</p>
<p align="justify">8 In another incident, when Victim 8 was in the Accused’s flat

past midnight playing the video games, the Accused sat beside him and talked about his

financial woes and work-related problems. Suddenly, the Accused unbuckled Victim 8’s

pants and pulled them down to his knees. He then proceeded to perform fellatio on Victim 8

who was too shocked to react and did not struggle but told him to stop. The Accused

ignored him and continued with his act until Victim 8 ejaculated. The Accused then

swallowed the semen.</p>
<p align="justify">9 On 21 June 2000, the complainant, a friend of the victims, confronted

the Accused with the allegation that he had performed fellatio on some of them. That led

to an argument and a fight between the two of them. The complainant then went to Victim

8’s home and informed the latter’s parents about what the Accused had done to

Victim 8. Confronted by his parents about it, Victim 8 admitted that the Accused had

performed fellatio on him.</p>
<p align="justify">10 The complainant, Victim 8 and his parents then proceeded to lodge a

police report against the Accused. Early the next morning, 22 June 2000, the police

arrested the Accused in his flat.</p>
<u>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE</p></u>
<p align="justify">11 After noting that the Accused’s only criminal record consisted

of a traffic offence in 1988, the Prosecution asked that a deterrent sentence be imposed

on the Accused based on the guidelines enunciated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Lim Hock

Hin Kelvin v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 801</nobr>. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused had

abused the trust reposed in him by the boys who regarded him as an elder brother or uncle.

It was also said that "such an introduction to sexuality by this self-professed

homosexual could result in some form of sexual confusion in the victims" and that

"these acts of sexual deviancy have a very corrupting effect especially on

adolescents such as the eight victims in the present instance". The Prosecution also

submitted that there should be no distinction in principle between anal sex and oral sex

where Section 377 of the Penal Code was concerned.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify">THE MITIGATION PLEA</p>
<p align="justify">12 In his handwritten Mitigation Plea, the Accused claimed that

"it was a voluntary act by which both parties were interested in the act."

Moreover, he added, he "was being seduced" and his mind "was unstable

during the incident". He explained that he was not suggesting that the boys had asked

him to perform oral sex on them but merely that some of them had disturbed him and talked

about oral sex. He was sexually stimulated but the stimulation was not by the boys.</p>
<p align="justify">13 The Accused also said that he did not use any force, that the boys

were willing parties and they knew that he was a homosexual. He claimed that his

"male genetic hormones have been reduced through the years". </p>
<p align="justify">14 Although he wrote that the 23 Charges were "considerably

unfair" and he had "pleaded guilty in station due to heavy stress and thorough

interrogation", he confirmed in Court that he was willingly confessing to the

offences. He was very remorseful and regretted what he had done "though it was not my

intention". He felt sorry for the victims. He also felt ashamed and very guilty and

begged for leniency.</p>
<p align="justify">15 The Accused is single. His father passed away recently. His mother

was in Johor and was very ill. </p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify">DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
<p align="justify">16 The punishment provided under Section 377 of the Penal Code is

imprisonment for life or imprisonment for up to 10 years and a discretionary fine. </p>
<p align="justify">17 Since the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>PP v Kwan Kwong Weng</i>

[1997] I SLR 697, it is clear that fellatio between two male persons is unnatural carnal

intercourse within the meaning of Section 377 of the Penal Code. Consent is irrelevant

although threats or the use of violence would aggravate the offence. </p>
<p align="justify">18 The Court of Appeal in <i>Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 801</nobr> laid down the following sentencing guidelines in respect of paedophiles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"24 Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from

  the position that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of

  anal intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without any

  aggravating or mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.

  There should not be any difference whether the victim is a young girl or a young boy. The

  court would then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in increasing or

  reducing the sentence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19 Where chronic paedophiles are concerned, the Court of Appeal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"35 … In future, chronic paedophiles (such as the appellant)

  who are shown to be unable or unwilling to control themselves and who target children as

  victims should be sentenced to life imprisonment …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">20 In the present case, the offences occurred over a period of some 12

months. The Accused here has no previous convictions save for a traffic offence. I do not

think therefore that he necessarily falls within the meaning of "chronic

paedophile" contemplated by the Court of Appeal in <i>Kelvin Lim</i> and life

imprisonment is probably not appropriate here.</p>
<p align="justify">21 Last month, I dealt with the case of <i>PP v Tan Ah Kit</i> (CC No.

67 of 2000), where two Charges of anal intercourse and one Charge of fellatio involving

two boys were proceeded with. Six other Charges were taken into consideration there, one

of which involved anal intercourse and three involved fellatio.</p>
<p align="justify">22 In <i>PP v Tan Ah Kit</i>, I made the following remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"23 The Court of Appeal’s sentencing guidelines (at paragraph

  24 of the judgment) apply to paedophiles performing anal intercourse on young children

  below 14 years of age. The guidelines apply squarely to the first victim, MF, who was 11

  and 12 years old at the material times. Where the second victim S was concerned, he was

  almost 15 years old at the time of the offences but did not appear to have been materially

  more mature or intelligent than MF was. Moreover, the unnatural carnal intercourse

  involved in the two Charges concerning S was fellatio and not anal intercourse. In <i>Kelvin

  Lim</i>, the acts of fellatio were made the subject of Charges under Section 377A and not

  Section 377 of the Penal Code. Section 377A carries a maximum imprisonment term of only

  two years and Kelvin Lim received one year imprisonment for each of the five Charges under

  Section 377A. Whether fellatio is made the subject of a Charge under Section 377 or 377A

  of the Penal Code is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. … In my view, fellatio and

  anal intercourse involving two males are not really distinguishable when they are the

  subject of Charges preferred under Section 377. Everything said about anal intercourse

  applies to oral intercourse except for the potential physical injury caused by penetration

  of the victim’s anus. Further, I do not think any distinction ought to be made on the

  basis of who is penetrating whom. I am therefore of the opinion that the guidelines set by

  the Court of Appeal should apply to the case of S in the same way as they patently do in

  the case of MF."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">23 In this case, in the eight Charges proceeded with, eight boys were

involved. All had fellatio performed on them. They ranged in age between 12 plus and 14

plus at the time of the offences stated in the said eight Charges. Those who were past 14

years of age did not appear to be materially more mature or intelligent than those who

were below 14 years of age.</p>
<p align="justify">24 Like <i>Tan Ah Kit</i>, the Accused here knew "where to fish

and what would make the fishes bite". Here, it was the video game equipment that he

used to entice the boys to his lair. He obviously had a paedophilic predator’s mind

and ability to target the potential victims. While violence or threats would aggravate the

offences, the seeming consent or acquiescence of the young vulnerable victims did not make

the offences any less abhorrent. The law must punish severely those who have attained

maturity but take advantage of the youthful innocence of those who can be easily led

astray by gifts, games or money. </p>
<p align="justify">25 I see no significant mitigating factors here save for the

Accused’s plea of guilt. I therefore sentence the Accused to 10 years imprisonment in

respect of each of the eight Charges to which he has pleaded guilty. In view of the

abhorrent nature of the offences, the number of boys and the total number of offences

involved, society should be protected from him for a long time. I am therefore ordering

the imprisonment sentences for the 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>

Charges to run consecutively with effect from 22 June 2000. The other four imprisonment

sentences will run concurrently with these four, making a total of 40 years imprisonment

with effect from 22 June 2000.</p>
