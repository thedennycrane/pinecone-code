<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Are finders keepers? One could be forgiven for
                    thinking that the law on such a simple question is relatively settled. However,
                    as demonstrated in this case, a finder can in certain circumstances attract
                    criminal liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It is important to recognise that civil
                    liability for property claims has a direct bearing on criminal liability in
                    respect of offences under Chapter XVII of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed),
                    collectively known as “Offences Against Property”. Therefore, an
                    understanding of the scope and content of property rights in civil law is
                    essential for a proper interpretation of criminal law provisions relating to
                    property offences. As fittingly observed by Lord Macaulay in his book, <em>Speeches and Poems, with the Report and Notes on the Indian Penal
                        Code</em> (Riverside Press, 1867) at p 432:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is such a mutual relation between the different parts of the law
                        that those parts must all attain perfection together. That portion, be it
                        what it may, which is selected to be first put into the form of a code, with
                        whatever clearness and precision it may be expressed and arranged, must
                        necessarily partake to a considerable extent of the uncertainty and
                        obscurity in which other portions are still left.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This observation applies with peculiar force to that important portion of
                        the penal code which we now propose to consider. <em>The
                            offences defined in this chapter are made punishable on the ground that
                            they are violations of the right of property; but the right of property
                            is itself the creature of the law. It is evident, therefore, that if the
                            substantive civil law touching this right be imperfect or obscure, the
                            penal law which is auxiliary to that substantive law, and of which the
                            object is to add a sanction to that substantive law, must partake of the
                            imperfection or obscurity. It is impossible for us to be certain that we
                            have made proper penal provisions for violations of civil rights till we
                            have a complete knowledge of all civil rights; and this we cannot have
                            while the law respecting those rights is either obscure or
                            unsettled.</em> As the present state of the civil law causes
                        perplexity to the legislator in framing the penal code, so it will
                        occasionally cause perplexity to the judges in administering that code. If
                        it be matter of doubt what things are the subjects of a certain right, in
                        whom that right resides, and to what that right extends, it must also be
                        matter of doubt whether that right has or has not been violated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant, Wong Seng Kwan, was convicted in
                    the court below of dishonest misappropriation of the cash taken from a wallet
                    which he found on the floor of the Marina Bay Sands Casino (“the
                    Casino”). He was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 and in default two
                    weeks’ imprisonment. He appealed against the conviction and after hearing
                    the parties, I was satisfied that the conviction was safe and dismissed the
                    appeal. However, as the appeal had raised an interesting issue of public
                    interest, I decided to issue my detailed grounds to provide some clarity on the
                    rights and obligations of a finder against the backdrop of the offence of
                    dishonest misappropriation of property under s 403 of the Penal Code (“s
                    403”). This judgment will explain what steps, if any, a finder of lost
                    property in a public place should take in order to avoid or minimise the risk of
                    criminal liability. On my direction, both the Prosecution and counsel for the
                    Defence, Mr Manoj Nandwani (“Mr Nandwani”) filed further
                    submissions to assist the court in providing my detailed grounds. I would like
                    to record my appreciation to both counsel for their clear and concise
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       This appeal arose from the decision of the trial
                    judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Public Prosecutor v Wong
                        Seng Kwan</em> [2011] SGDC 197. The appellant, Wong Seng Kwan, was
                    tried on the following amended charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC 25615/2010</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of June
                        2010, at or about 1.48am, at Marina Bay Sands Casino, Singapore did
                        dishonestly misappropriate to your own use a wallet, which you knew to be
                        the property of a person other than yourself, to wit by not returning the
                        wallet to the security personnel of Marina Bay Sands Casino and instead
                        taking out cash from the said wallet and you have thereby committed an
                        offence punishable under Section 403 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The facts of this case were relatively
                    uncomplicated because the Prosecution and the Defence tendered an Agreed

                            table and placed her wallet of unknown brand and value on the side of
                            the chair she was seated.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">On 10 June 2010 at about 1.46am, while the

                            the complainant dropped her wallet on the floor near the said
                            ‘Midi Baccarat’ table. On 10 June 2010 at about 1.48am, the
                            accused came along and picked up the complainant’s wallet from the
                            floor. The accused then <em>walked towards the toilet
                                with the complainant’s wallet</em> at about 1.50am on 10
                            June 2010. The accused then came out of the toilet at about 1.53am on 10
                            June 2010 <em>without holding the complainant’s
                                wallet in his hands.</em></span></p>

                                made by the security staff of [the Casino] but the wallet could not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution adduced the security tapes of
                    the Casino (“CCTV recording”) to establish the facts stated in the
                    Agreed Statement of Facts. The main issue at the trial below was whether the
                    confession was voluntarily made by the appellant to the police (“the Long
                    Statement”). After conducting a <em>voir dire</em>,
                    the Judge found that the Long Statement was made voluntarily without any threat,
                    inducement, promise or any form of oppressive conduct and admitted it in
                    evidence. The Long Statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> contained the following
                    confessions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">4</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In the toilet, I discovered that the wallet belonged

                            noticed that there were dollar notes of 10 RMB currency and S$150/-
                            in three denominations. <em>At this juncture I took the
                                cash of S$150/- out from the wallet as I believed that the owner

                    removed the cash from the wallet, when he was shown the CCTV
                recording.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the trial below, the complainant, Ms Sun Yan
                    Li (“Ms Sun”), testified that when she went to the Casino on 10
                    June 2010, her wallet contained, <em>inter alia</em>, about
                    S$200 in cash, a RMB10 banknote, her China identification card, a Singapore
                    credit card and a China bank card.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Although the appellant admitted to picking up
                    the wallet, at the trial, he vehemently denied taking the cash from the wallet.
                    The appellant also denied that he saw any identification documents (<em>eg</em>, Ms Sun’s China identification card) in the
                    wallet. However, after hearing all the evidence, the Judge disbelieved his
                    defence. The Judge held at [45]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The numerous discrepancies in the Defence’s case and the incredulous
                        explanations put forth by the Accused led me to the irresistible conclusion
                        that he was not a truthful witness. I disbelieved his defence that although
                        he had picked up the wallet and checked its contents, he had not taken the
                        cash from the wallet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Long Statement, which was admitted in
                    evidence by the Judge, corroborated the above finding. Consequently, the Judge,
                    after a seven-day trial, convicted the appellant of the offence of dishonest
                    misappropriation of property under s 403 and sentenced him to a fine of $2,000
                    and in default two weeks’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Nandwani raised the following grounds on
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     that there was no good Samaritan law
                        mandating the appellant to return an item that he stumbled
                    upon;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the
                        appellant had no intention to cause any wrongful gain or wrongful
                        loss;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the
                        Judge failed to consider that the appellant could not have taken the money
                        from the wallet because none of the other items alleged to be in the wallet
                        were found on the appellant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     that the Judge gave undue weight to the Long Statement
                        because based on contemporaneous evidence, there were factual
                        inconsistencies in the Long Statement, and any doubt should have been
                        resolved in the favour of the appellant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     that objective evidence adduced at trial was
                        sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt to justify the appellant’s
                        acquittal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In response, the Prosecution made the
                    following submissions that the decision of the Judge should be upheld:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Judge found that the confession
                        in the Long Statement was made voluntarily and the appellant was not a
                        truthful witness;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     although the appellant could easily have ascertained the identity of
                        the wallet’s owner; or alternatively, handed over the wallet to the
                        security personnel of the Casino, he did not do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Ms Sun’s testimony in court was
                        reliable and the Judge was correct to hold that there were sufficient
                        identification documents in the wallet to enable the appellant to locate its
                        owner; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        facts of the present case fell squarely within Explanation 2 and
                        Illustration (e) to Explanation 2 of s 403.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The above arguments essentially concerned two
                    key issues which were dispositive of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the appellant had
                        dishonestly misappropriated the cash from the wallet; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the appellant had reasonable
                        means to ascertain the identity of the owner of the
                wallet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although both issues are largely factual in
                    nature, their determination involved an examination of the rights of the
                    appellant as finder of the wallet and the steps which he was required to take on
                    finding the lost property. Before doing so, it is perhaps useful to provide some
                    overview of the property offences under the Penal Code and to explain how they
                    differ from each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">An overview of property offences in the Penal Code</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The distinction between criminal
                    misappropriation and other property offences such as theft, cheating and
                    criminal breach of trust may not be immediately apparent to a layperson. They
                    all involve property and an element of dishonesty but the punishment provisions
                    are somewhat different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While the element of dishonesty is common to
                    all property offences, the critical distinction between criminal
                    misappropriation, theft, cheating and criminal breach of trust lies in the
                    manner in which the accused person <em>initially</em> comes
                    across the movable property. An accused person commits <em>theft</em> if the movable property was originally in the possession
                    of some other person and the accused person moves the property with a dishonest
                    intention to take it. For <em>criminal
                        misappropriation</em>, the accused person <em>initially</em> comes across the movable property in a legally neutral
                    manner (<em>eg</em>, by finding), and he <em>subsequently</em> forms a dishonest intention to deal with the
                    movable property in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights of the true
                    owner. As for <em>criminal breach of trust</em>, the
                    accused person is entrusted with property or dominion over the property at the
                    outset by another person, and he dishonestly uses or disposes of that property
                    in abuse of trust while for <em>cheating</em>, the
                    possession of the property is voluntarily handed over to the accused person as a
                    result of his deceitful or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The fact that an accused person charged with
                    the offence of criminal misappropriation would usually have come across the
                    movable property in a legally neutral manner is significant, because while civil
                    rights and liabilities would attach at the moment when the accused person
                    asserts possession over the property, criminal liability would <em>only</em> attach <em>when</em> the
                    accused person forms a dishonest intention. According to Dr Hari Singh Gour,
                        <em>Penal Law of India</em> (Law Publishers (India) Pvt
                    Ltd, 11th Ed, 2011) (“<em>Gour</em>”) at p

<b>6. What is criminal
                            misappropriation?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The illustrations to Sec. 403, which are rather statements of principle
                        than mere illustrations, clearly show that the essence of criminal
                        misappropriation of property is that the property comes into the possession
                        of the accused in some neutral manner, whereas the illustrations in Sec. 405
                        show equally clearly that the property comes into the possession of the
                        accused either by an express entrustment or by some process placing the
                        accused in a position of trust. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question whether the act is theft or misappropriation depends upon
                        when the dishonestly began — was it before or after the thing came
                        into possession. This is a point of division as much between the two
                        offences — theft and criminal misappropriation in the Code … In
                        theft the initial taking is wrongful, <em>in criminal
                            misappropriation it is indifferent and may even be innocent, but
                            </em><em>it becomes wrongful by a subsequent change
                            of intention</em>, or from knowledge of some new fact with which
                        the party was not previously acquainted [<em>Bhagiram v Ahar
                            Dome</em> ILR 15 Cal 388, at 400].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Given that the distinction between theft and
                    dishonest misappropriation of movable property depends on whether the <em>initial</em> taking is wrongful, and that criminal liability
                    might still attach on a subsequent change in intention, it is important for a
                    finder to know when the taking of the movable property, though <em>initially</em> neutral, may nonetheless <em>subsequently</em> become wrongful.</p>

                    criminally liable for misappropriation or conversion under s 403. This judgment,
                    however, will focus principally on the position of a finder like the appellant
                    in this case, with specific reference to Explanation 2 and Illustrations (a) to
                    (f) thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Element 1: Property belonging to someone else</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abandoned property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The significance of this ingredient is that
                    the offence does not arise if the lost chattel has been <em>abandoned</em> since in such a case there is really no owner to speak
                    of. In this case, there can be no suggestion that Ms Sun had abandoned her
                    wallet. Whether a lost chattel has been abandoned is essentially a question of
                    fact to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. Factors such as
                    (a) the place where the chattel was found; (b) the nature of the chattel;
                    and (c) the value of the chattel are relevant considerations to determine
                    whether the owner had intended to abandon the chattel. It is ultimately an
                    exercise of common sense. The higher the value of the lost chattel, the less
                    likely it has been abandoned by the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The topic of abandonment of property was
                    recently comprehensively surveyed by Associate Professor Saw Cheng Lim in
                        <em>The Law of Abandonment and the Passing of Property in
                        Trash</em> (2011) 23 SAcLJ 145, where the learned author explained at
                    p 167 that the circumstances surrounding the discarding of chattels should raise
                    the irresistible inference that the original owners had clearly abandoned them
                    – both possession and ownership. Associate Professor Saw concluded at p
                    173 that given that it is difficult to predict with any certainty how much proof
                    is required to establish a specific and unequivocal intention on the part of the
                    original owner to abandon the property in question, the courts should be slow to
                    make any finding of abandonment except in the clearest of cases. I agree with
                    the view expressed by Associate Professor Saw.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rights of a finder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In understanding the relevance of this issue,
                    it is necessary to note that finders do acquire certain rights to lost chattel
                    found by them. However, where the finder is able to locate the owner but fails
                    to do so, he may be convicted of the offence under s 403. As such, it is
                    particularly pertinent to discuss the rights of the finder and the reasonable
                    steps that the finder is obliged to take to avoid criminal
                liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This issue is part of the critical path in
                    determining whether the offence under s 403 is made out. As pointed out at
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, the first ingredient of the
                    offence under s 403 is that the lost chattel must belong to someone other than
                    the accused person. That being the case, the inquiry must be examined in the
                    context of the rights, if any, of a finder such as the appellant and the means
                    by which the true owner of a lost chattel can be ascertained and/or
                    identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The common law distinguishes between the
                    concept of ownership and possession. In the normal state of affairs, possession
                    of a chattel is the outward expression of ownership. Ownership is the highest
                    possible right in a thing that exists, and the person with the best possible
                    right to a thing is the owner: see Duncan Sheehan, <em>The
                        Principles of Personal Property Law</em> (Hart Publishing, 2011) at pp
                    4–18.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, a finder is in an anomalous situation
                    because the true owner of a lost chattel is presumed to have lost possession,
                    but not ownership, of the lost chattel. The rights of a finder arise by virtue
                    of finding a lost chattel <em>and</em> asserting possession
                    over it. The act of asserting possession allows the finder to acquire certain
                    rights over the lost chattel. So long as a finder of the lost chattel acts
                    within his legal entitlement, he would not have caused any “wrongful
                    gain” and/or “wrongful loss” and consequently cannot be
                    said to have acted dishonestly to attract criminal liability. I will be
                    returning to the issue of “wrongfulness” at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is clear that a finder has the <em>right to possess</em> the lost chattel from the moment of
                    finding it. Therefore, for the purposes of s 403, the fact of finding and
                    asserting possession cannot <em>per se</em> constitute an
                    offence. Indeed, the Penal Code expressly provides for the above situation in
                    Illustration (a) to Explanation 2 of s 403:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A finds a dollar on the high road, not knowing to whom the dollar
                        belongs. A picks up the dollar. Here A has not committed the offence
                        defined in this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, since the true owner has never
                    intended to divest his right to ownership (this assumes that he did not abandon
                    the chattel), it would not be possible for the finder to acquire an ownership
                    right over the lost chattel. In such a case, what right(s), if any, does a
                    finder acquire after he asserts possession over the lost chattel? A finder
                    merely obtains a right to possess and not a right to ownership by virtue of his
                    find and being the first to assert possession over the lost chattel. Yet,
                    paradoxically, as noted at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above, there
                    is a presumption that the person in possession is the owner. How does the law
                    resolve this seemingly irreconcilable conundrum?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Gordian knot described above can be
                    resolved by applying the concept of relativity of title. The finder has good
                    title as against the whole world except the true owner: see <em>Armory v Delamirie</em> (1722) 1 Str 505 (“<em>Armory</em>”). Professors F H Lawson and Bernard
                    Rudden explained in <em>The Law of Property</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 3rd Ed, 2002) at p 65 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you make a ring from your own hair, there is no doubt whatever that it
                        is yours and that you have a better right to it than anyone else. If you
                        lose it, you can claim it from the finder. But in the absence of any claim
                        by you, the finder is treated as having a title good against everyone. You
                        have a better right to possess the thing than does the finder, but the
                        finder has a better right to possess it than does anyone else.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Armory</em>, the
                    plaintiff, a chimney sweeper’s boy, found a jewel and took it to a
                    goldsmith’s shop to find out what it was. An apprentice from the shop took
                    out the stones from the jewel and refused to return the stones to the boy.
                    Pratt CJ held at [1]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. That the finder of a jewel, though he does not by such finding acquire
                        an absolute property or ownership, yet he has such a property as will enable
                        him to keep it against all but the rightful owner, and consequently may
                        maintain trover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The position in Singapore as regards the
                    rights of finders of lost chattel is similar to the position in England.
                    According to Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <em>The Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011) at p 422:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the adage “finders keepers” aptly sums up, a person who
                        finds a lost or abandoned item acquires good title against everyone except
                        the true owner [<em>Armory v Delamirie</em> (1722) 1
                        Str 505]. A finder, in general, is the person who first exerts control over
                        lost or abandoned property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Since the finder has good title to the lost
                    chattel as against the whole world except the <em>true
                        owner</em>, criminal liability, if any, of the finder would depend on,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, whether the true owner can be
                    ascertained and/or identified by the finder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasonable steps to locate the owner</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As the finder’s title is good against
                    the whole world except the true owner, retention of the lost chattel might be
                    construed as dishonest if the finder is able to locate the true owner using
                    reasonable means but fails to do so and decides to retain possession for
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is important to note that the question as
                    to what reasonable steps should be taken to locate the owner only arises for
                    consideration if the person who finds the chattel decides to take possession of
                    it. When the person stumbles upon a lost chattel, he has three options: he could
                    choose to ignore it and walk away; or having picked it up decides to leave it
                    behind; or he could assert possession over it. It is only if the person chooses
                    to retain the lost chattel in his possession that he becomes a finder with the
                    attendant rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Where a person finds and decides to take
                    possession of a lost chattel of which from its nature, there must be an owner,
                    the law requires the finder to take reasonable steps to discover and give notice
                    to the owner, and keep the lost chattel for a reasonable time to allow the owner
                    to claim it: see Explanation 2 to s 403. Explanation 2 also clearly states that
                    what are reasonable means, or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a
                    question of fact. The finder is not obliged to undertake extraordinary steps or
                    incur disproportionate expenses in order to locate the true owner of the lost
                    chattel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There is a wide spectrum of circumstances that
                    may give rise to different consequences. In one extreme, a person who finds a
                    dollar note on the street would ordinarily not be expected to take any step to
                    locate the owner because identification of the true owner would be practically
                    impossible. At the other extreme, the finder might have actual knowledge of the
                    identity of the owner. For example, the finder might have witnessed the owner
                    dropping his wallet; or he might know the owner personally and had previously
                    seen the owner use the particular item that he just found. In such cases, the
                    finder is required to restore the lost chattel to its owner without unreasonable
                    delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, in between these two extreme examples
                    is a wide spectrum of circumstances where the position may not be entirely
                    clear. For example, a person may find an expensive watch that carries a serial
                    number or a diamond ring with a laser identification number or mark that is not
                    easily visible to the naked eye. While an expert or a collector may know where
                    to look and who to contact to trace the identity of the owner, the layperson who
                    finds such items may not even notice the serial number, let alone appreciate its
                    significance. What should such a finder do in cases like these to avoid the risk
                    of criminal liability?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The crucial question to ask in every situation
                    is whether the finder can reasonably be expected to discover and give notice to
                    the owner. In my opinion, what amounts to reasonable steps would always depend
                    on all the circumstances of the case, including the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>The place where
                            the lost chattel was found</em>. If, for example, the lost chattel
                        is found in a vacated hotel room, it is likely that the owner can be located
                        as opposed to an item found in a public area of a shopping mall. If,
                        instead, the lost chattel was found in a shop in a shopping mall, it would
                        be reasonable to expect the owner to retrace his footsteps back to the shop
                        after realising that he had lost the chattel. In such a situation, in order
                        to avoid criminal liability, it would be prudent for the finder to leave his
                        contact details with the shop owner to discharge his duty of taking
                        reasonable means to give notice to the owner. The finder may only deal with
                        the lost chattel as his own after the owner has failed to claim it in spite
                        of the lapse of a reasonable time. Alternatively, he could leave it behind
                        with the shop owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>The nature and value of the lost
                            chattel</em>. Finding cash in a public area may pose a greater
                        problem for the finder to locate the owner as opposed to finding a wallet in
                        a hotel lobby. Given the fungible nature of cash, it would usually be
                        practically impossible to locate the owner of lost cash unless the cash was
                        found together with other identifying items (see (c) below) or if there are
                        special facts that could potentially lead to the identification of the
                        owner. In this regard, there must be some proportionality between the value
                        of the lost chattel and the steps that a finder is required to take in order
                        to locate the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>The nature of identifying features on the lost
                            chattel</em>. Where there are clear identification marks, such as
                        the address of the owner or a telephone number, the owner of the lost
                        chattel can be easily discovered and contacted. For other identification
                        marks such as names, NRIC numbers, bank account numbers, membership numbers
                        or serial numbers, the finder would usually require the assistance of the
                        police or the issuing body in locating the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Each of the above factors would assist the
                    finder to identify the true owner and will therefore be relevant to ascertain
                    whether the finder has in fact taken reasonable steps. Of the six Illustrations
                    to Explanation 2, five of them would attract criminal liability under s 403
                    because in each of them, the finder did not take reasonable steps to locate the
                    owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It should not be overlooked that apart from
                    taking reasonable steps to locate the owner, the finder should also keep the
                    lost chattel for a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it, before
                    dealing with it as explained in Illustration (f). In other words, on finding a
                    valuable item with no apparent identification, if the finder sells it
                    immediately thereby preventing the true owner from ever claiming it back, he
                    would also have committed the offence. What amounts to keeping the lost chattel
                    for a reasonable time would, again, depend on the circumstances of each case. To
                    illustrate the above principles, the consequences of a finder’s failure to
                    take reasonable steps can be seen in the decision of Chan Sek Keong CJ in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor</em> v <em>Neo
                        Boon Seng</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 216 where the sentence of the finder
                    was enhanced from a fine of $6,000 to a term of imprisonment of three weeks. In
                    that case, the accused person was a taxi driver. His passenger boarded the taxi
                    at Changi Airport but left behind some items valued at $11,661.05 in the front
                    passenger seat of the taxi when he alighted at his residence. The accused person
                    did not take any step to return the items to the passenger even though he knew
                    where that passenger lived. Chan CJ held at [10] that:</p>

                        custody of his property to the taxi driver during the journey. <em>If the taxi driver finds lost property in the taxi, he should

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is difficult to exhaustively state what a
                    finder should do in any given circumstance owing to the diverse situations.
                    However, what is clear is that when a person finds a lost chattel which he knows
                    has not been abandoned, which is of some value and where the true owner can
                    possibly be identified and located, the prudent course of action would simply be
                    to report the lost chattel to the police, not because the finder is legally
                    obliged to do so, but because it is the best and most pragmatic way for the
                    finder to discharge his duty in taking reasonable steps to locate the owner, and
                    to avoid a finding of dishonesty that attracts criminal liability under s
                    403.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There are two distinct limbs under s 403,
                        <em>viz</em> the misappropriation limb and the
                    conversion limb. As a matter of statutory interpretation, both limbs are not
                    intended to have an identical meaning since it is presumed that Parliament does
                    nothing in vain, and the court must endeavour to give significance to every word
                    of an enactment: see <em>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: A
                        Code</em> (5th Ed, LexisNexis, 2008) at p 1157.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The meaning of “to appropriate”
                    (from which misappropriate derives its meaning) was discussed in the Indian case
                    of <em>Sohan </em><em>Lal v
                        Emperor</em> 1915 AIR All 380, where Piggot J held at 381 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The verb “to appropriate” in this connexion means
                        “setting apart for, or assigning to, a particular person or
                        use;” and “to misappropriate,” no doubt means
                            “<em>to set apart for or assign to the wrong
                            person or a wrong use</em>”, and this act must be done
                        dishonestly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Conversion, on the other hand, refers to an
                    act in dealing with the chattel in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the
                    true owner. A helpful definition can be found in the decision of Supreme Court
                    of Queensland in <em>R v Angus</em> [2000] QCA 29, where

                            opinion be such as to be inconsistent with the true owner’s
                            rights. Leaving a borrowed book on a shelf is not an act of conversion,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The meaning of “conversion”
                    under s 403 is consistent with civil liability for conversion. As can be seen
                    from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Tat Seng Machine
                        Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101, “inconsistency is the gist of the
                    action” for conversion. VK Rajah JA at [45] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Complex rules continue to govern its application even today. … The
                        following propositions are nevertheless now regarded as established.
                            <em>Generally, an act of conversion occurs when there is
                            unauthorised dealing with the claimant’s chattel so as to question
                            or deny his title to it</em> (<em>Clerk &amp;
                            Lindsell</em> at para 17-06). Sometimes, this is expressed in the
                        terms of a person taking a chattel out of the possession of someone else
                            <em>with</em> the “intention of exercising a
                        permanent or temporary dominion over it” (R F V Heuston and R A
                        Buckley, <em>Salmond &amp; Heuston on the Law of
                            Torts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 1996) (“<em>Salmond &amp; Heuston on Torts</em>”) at p 99).
                        …
                        <em>Inconsistency is the gist of the action, and thus there
                            is no need for the defendant to know that the goods belonged to someone

                            true owner’s rights</em> (<em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> Vol 45(2) (Butterworths,
                        4th Ed Reissue, 1999) at para 548).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The effect of the above distinction is that
                    conversion is a subset of misappropriation with the result that a person who has
                    committed conversion would have also committed criminal misappropriation but not
                    necessarily the other way round. The act of either misappropriation or
                    conversion constitutes the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> of the offence under s 403. Unlike
                    misappropriation, conversion requires the <em>additional</em> element of acting in a manner inconsistent with the
                    rights of the true owner, and usage is one way of acting inconsistently. Mere
                    possession is not sufficient to make out the element of
                conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The distinction was helpfully illustrated by
                    the Prosecution’s reference to <em>Tuan Puteh
                        </em><em>v Dragon</em> (1876) 3 Ky 86. There, the
                    accused person found a cheque payable to one Captain Strong. He attempted to
                    encash the cheque but could not do so owing to the absence of Captain
                    Strong’s endorsement. The court found that although there was no
                    conversion since he did not manage to encash the cheque, he clearly
                    misappropriated the cheque when he dishonestly attempted to encash
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“To his own use”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The appellant was charged with and convicted
                    of dishonestly misappropriating <em>to his own use</em> a
                    wallet, which he knew to be the property of a person other than himself. During
                    the appeal before me, I invited the Prosecution to clarify whether the words
                        “<em>to his own use</em>” in s 403
                    qualified both the misappropriation limb and the conversion limb or just the
                    latter. In response, the Prosecution submitted that it should only govern the
                    conversion limb and applied to amend the Charge to delete the words
                        “<em>to his own use</em>” pursuant to s
                    256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“CPC”). The Prosecution cited <em>Garmaz s/o
                        Pakhar and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 95, where
                    the Court of Appeal held at [28] and
                        [29] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The question still remains whether it is implicit
                            in s 256(<em>b</em>) of the CPC that the High

                            the charge. If a literal and strict construction is adopted, it is clear
                            that the High Court has no such power. However, such a construction
                            would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that
                            section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and
                            findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and
                            the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any
                            errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. …
                            <em>A more purposive construction should in our view be

                                is in the affirmative, subject to what we have to say

                    CPC, I have an implied power to amend the Charge in the manner proposed by the
                    Prosecution. Keeping in mind the potential prejudice of the amendment to the
                    appellant, the proposed amended Charge was read and explained to the appellant,
                    who thereafter informed the court through Mr Nandwani that his defence remained
                    unchanged notwithstanding the amendment to the Charge. As I was satisfied that
                    the amendment did not affect the substance of the Charge, I allowed the
                    amendment. The amendment was made and allowed without the benefit of substantive
                    submissions from both parties. Since then, the further submissions by both
                    parties have indeed confirmed that the words “<em>to his
                        own use</em>” only qualify the conversion limb. Let me

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The learned authors of Stanley Yeo, Neil

                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2012) explained at p 431
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[14.5]</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Section 403 is open to two interpretations. The
                            first is that the phrase ‘to his own use’ governs the word
                            misappropriates as well as the word conversion. Read in this way, the
                            physical element of criminal misappropriation is either
                            (i) conversion to one’s own use or (ii) misappropriation
                            to one’s own use. The second interpretation is that the phrase
                            ‘to his own use’ only governs the word conversion. In this
                            case, the physical element is either (i) misappropriation or
                            (ii) conversion to one’s own use.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I agree with the learned authors that to read
                    the requirement of “<em>to his own use</em>”
                    into the misappropriation limb would render the conversion limb otiose, with the
                    result that there would be no instance involving conversion that does not also
                    fall within the meaning of misappropriation. The learned authors of <em>Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</em> explain
                    insightfully at p 432 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[14.8]</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Under general

                                conversion</em></b>. Since conversion means
                            ‘appropriating’ another person’s property and then
                            making use of that property, misappropriation would have little or no
                            scope if it was read as ‘misappropriation <em>to
                                one’s own use</em>’. Consequently, the alternative
                            physical element should simply be ‘misappropriation’. It is
                            perhaps unfortunate that the Code refers to <em>mis</em>appropriation rather than appropriation because the
                            word <em>mis</em>appropriation might seem to
                            indicate that there is some element of dishonesty in the behaviour

                    defined under s 24 of the Penal Code as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>“Dishonestly”</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>24</b>.    Whoever does
                            anything with the <em>intention</em> of <em>causing </em><em>wrongful
                                gain</em> to one person, or <em>wrongful
                                loss</em> to another person, is said to do that
                            thing dishonestly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The definition of “dishonestly”
                    in turn makes reference to “wrongful gain” and “wrongful
                    loss” which are defined under s 23 of the Penal Code as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>“Wrongful gain”
                            and “wrongful loss”</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>23</b>.    “Wrongful gain” is <em>gain by
                                unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is
                                not legally entitled</em>; “wrongful loss”
                            is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing
                            it is legally entitled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Explanation.</em>—A person is said to
                        gain wrongfully when such person <em>retains
                            wrongfully</em>, as well as when such person <em>acquires wrongfully</em>. A person is said to lose
                        wrongfully when such person is <em>wrongfully kept out of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As the verb “misappropriates”
                    itself conveys an element of wrongfulness, as opposed to the neutral verb
                    “appropriates”, it seems to be tautologous to qualify it with the
                    word “dishonestly”. As Yong Pung How CJ observed in <em>Tan Tze Chye v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 876 at
                        [37]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>To “misappropriate” means to set apart or
                            assign to the wrong person or wrong use, and this must be done
                            dishonestly.</em> Setting aside property by one person for the use
                        of another other than himself and the true owner can also constitute
                        misappropriation; see <em>Tan Sri Tan Hian
                            </em><em>Tsin v PP</em> [1979] 1 MLJ 73 where
                        criminal breach of trust was committed by the MD of the company which paid
                        money into the bank account of another company of which he and his wife were
                        the sole shareholders. Therefore, in this case, setting aside property for
                        the appellant as well as his brother’s firm could both constitute
                        misappropriation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the present appeal, there can be no dispute
                    that in picking up the wallet, the appellant had committed an act of
                    appropriation. At that stage, his act of appropriation was still neutral.
                    However, his intention would become dishonest if he removed the cash from the
                    wallet and kept it as his own. No usage is necessary. The essence of the
                    appellant’s defence was directed at the alleged subsequent change of
                    intention. He claimed that although he admitted to picking up the wallet, he
                    left it behind in the toilet and did not remove the cash of $150 from the
                    wallet. The appellant urged the court to acquit him on the basis that all the
                    cash that was found in his possession when he was arrested had been properly
                    accounted for and therefore the critical ingredient of dishonest
                    misappropriation of the cash from the wallet was not made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The appellant claimed that he withdrew $3,500
                    in cash from his account with the Casino and had a balance sum of $3,200
                    (inclusive of casino chips) at the time of his arrest. He alleged that the
                    difference of $300 was lost on the poker table and since all the monies were
                    accounted for, it must follow that he did not take the cash from the wallet. The
                    force of the argument was misconceived because there was no evidence that he
                    lost $300 on the poker table. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary as the
                    appellant conceded in cross-examination that he played other games as well and
                    had won some monies in those games. In any event, this defence was completely
                    contradicted by the appellant’s Long Statement and his oral confession
                    where he admitted to taking the cash from the wallet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Judge accepted the evidence of Ms Sun that
                    her wallet contained her identification card. I saw no reason to disturb her
                    finding. In the circumstances, by taking the cash from the wallet, and disposing
                    of the wallet with the identifying documents, the appellant had clearly intended
                    to cause wrongful gain to himself and/or wrongful loss to the true owner, Ms
                    Sun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The present appeal is therefore a clear case
                    of criminal misappropriation on its facts. It may not be so clear where, for
                    example, the finder picks up a wallet containing cash and the owner’s
                    identification but chooses to leave it in his home without using it because he
                    could not be bothered to return it to the owner or to report his find to the
                    police. In such a case, is the offence made out? Perhaps so, since such an act
                    would have caused a wrongful loss to the true owner. In such situations, it is
                    always prudent to report the find to the police. This is not an exhortation to
                    act in a morally upright manner. Instead, it is a cautionary step to take to
                    avoid criminal liability. As explained at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above, the finder can choose to either ignore the lost
                    chattel or leave it behind after picking it up to avoid criminal liability. In
                    such a situation, the finder does not attract any criminal liability because
                    there is no act of appropriation to begin with. However once he decides to
                    assert possession, the rights and obligations attach at that point in
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the result, the decision of the Judge is
                    affirmed and the appeal is consequently dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is hoped that this decision has provided
                    some useful guidelines for persons who through no initial fault of theirs come
                    across lost chattel. Finders are not always keepers, and a finder who
                    dishonestly keeps his find may instead “<em>find</em>” himself in violation of the law.</p>
