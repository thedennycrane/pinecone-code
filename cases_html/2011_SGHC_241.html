<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Clauses in employment contracts which prohibit
                    an employee from working for a competitor upon termination of employment must be
                    shown to be reasonable to be enforceable. This principle of law was founded on
                    public policy considerations to promote the free flow of expertise in the
                    interests of the individual and society. Over the years, in certain trades,
                    industries or professions, employees have come to wield considerable power in
                    negotiating favourable terms of employment. Quite often, because of their skill
                    and hence their mobility, they have a <em>choice</em> not
                    to accept terms in their employment contracts. Employers have also evolved their
                    remuneration packages to provide financial incentives for employees to remain
                    with them and equally for financial disincentives not to leave them or to join a
                    competitor. When such an employee leaves the employer, he again has the choice
                    to join a competitor and if he chooses to compete, the only consequence is a
                    financial disincentive, for example, the forfeiture of a deferred bonus. In such
                    cases, is the public policy consideration in promoting the free flow of skill
                    offended?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case presents an interesting issue for
                    determination which hitherto has not been judicially decided in Singapore though
                    a number of previous decisions on restraint of trade clauses are relevant in
                    arriving at my decision. The present case concerns the issue of whether a clause
                    in an employee incentive award plan (<em>as distinct</em>
                    from the employment contract) which forfeits deferred incentive payments in the
                    event that the employee competes with his employer is in <em>substance</em> a restraint of trade. In a number of English and
                    Australian cases, the courts have treated such clauses as amounting in <em>substance</em> to a restraint of trade. The treatment of such
                    clauses in the United States is divided. However, there is also a body of case
                    law upholding provisions in employment contracts that forfeit deferred bonuses
                    when the employee leaves the employer <em>regardless</em>
                    of whether the employee proceeds to compete with the employer. In those
                    decisions, such clauses are not regarded as in restraint of trade. Is there a
                    rational reason why in the former, the clauses are regarded as in restraint of
                    trade but not in the latter especially when in the latter group of cases, the
                    effect on the employee would appear to be more far reaching in that the deferred
                    bonus is forfeited when the employee leaves his employment irrespective whether
                    the employee joins a competitor or otherwise? This judgment will examine these
                    two groups of cases with the view to rationalising the basis for the
                    distinction, if any, and to provide more certainty to employees and employers
                    when negotiating such deferred incentive plans.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Cargill TSF Asia Pte Ltd (“the
                    defendant”) is part of the Cargill group of companies (“the
                    Cargill Group”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Cargill Group provides
                    food, agricultural, risk management, financial and industrial products and
                    services around the world.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The defendant is part of
                    the Cargill Group’s Trade and Structured Finance (“TSF”)
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the defendant, the TSF business
                    involved leveraging on trade flows between countries to customise cross-border
                    financing solutions for trade related financing. The defendant referred to these
                    customised solutions as “Structured Solutions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The defendant claimed
                    that a Structured Solution involved considerable teamwork between the
                    defendant’s employees and its tax and legal advisors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The
                    work product of a Structured Solution is a document known as a “Product
                    Approval Form” (“PAF”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant claimed that a PAF is “a unique, confidential and proprietary
                    ‘how-to-do’ manual setting out all the pertinent information on a
                    Structured Solution”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to the defendant, Mano Vikrant Singh
                    (“the plaintiff”) first joined the Cargill Group in 1992 as a
                    trader and analyst in its Emerging Markets Department.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In 1998, he was assigned to work
                    as an analyst and trader with Cargill Asia Pacific Ltd
                        (“CAPL”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He
                    resigned in 1999<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and rejoined the Cargill
                    Group in 2002<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and was employed by
                    Cargill Financial Services Corp (“Cargill FSC”) as its TSF
                    business co-ordinator. In between, the plaintiff joined another company which
                    was also involved in trade and structured financial products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In November 2003, he was
                    assigned to work in Singapore as CAPL’s TSF Innovation Co-ordinator. In
                    April 2007, the plaintiff moved over to the defendant as a senior trader, a
                    position he held until he resigned on 27 November 2008. I should mention
                    that the plaintiff had deposed that he was initially employed by Cargill FSC in
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Prior to that, he claimed that he
                    was running his own business involving the buying and selling of trade
                        receivables.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> This difference in the
                    plaintiff’s employment history is, however, immaterial to the issues
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s position in the defendant
                    was described as “Senior Trader (Corporate Band – Senior
                        Advisor)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    The precise role of the plaintiff in the defendant was initially contested by
                    the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     According to the plaintiff, he was
                        primarily involved in trading financial instruments which arose from the
                        commodity trading activities of the defendant. His role was to deal with the
                        defendant’s structured trade and non-trade financial
                            products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He also carried
                        on a “third-party business” (“the Third Party
                            Business”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff claims that the
                        Third Party Business was his “existing business” which he
                        brought over to Cargill FSC when he first joined it in 2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     According to the defendant, the plaintiff served
                        as an “originator” and a “structurer” of the
                        defendant’s Structured Solutions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> As an originator, the
                        plaintiff would identify and meet potential and/or existing trading partners
                        and financial institutions to participate in the defendant’s
                        Structured Solutions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> As a structurer, the
                        plaintiff would strategise and create Structured Solutions to maximise
                        profits from a trade flow.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the
                    course of the oral arguments, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Philip
                    Jeyaretnam SC (“Mr Jeyaretnam SC”) accepted, for the purpose
                    of the present proceedings, that the plaintiff’s role in the
                    defendant’s TSF business was as an “initiator” (<em>sic</em>) or “structurer”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The contractual framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The main contract between the parties was an
                    employment contract set out in a letter from the defendant to the plaintiff
                    dated 28 March 2007, which was accepted by the plaintiff on 30 March
                    2007 (“the Employment Contract”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> It is only necessary to
                    highlight one clause in the Employment Contract. Clause 12 of the Employment

                    Agreement”). It is a requirement for all employees to execute the
                    Non-Compete Agreement. Under clause 3 of the Non-Compete Agreement, the
                    plaintiff agreed, <em>inter alia</em>, not to compete with

                    Markets Pte Ltd (“Xangbo”). The parties initially disputed the
                    nature of Xangbo’s business and the precise date when Xangbo began
                    operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 4 November 2008, the plaintiff gave

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to convert OS 103/2011 into a writ action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant had applied to convert OS
                    103/2011 into a writ action (“the conversion application”) on the
                    ground that there are substantial disputes of fact material to the resolution of
                    OS 103/2011. As explained above, initially there were disputes about the precise
                    role of the plaintiff within the defendant and the nature of the TSF business.
                    However in the course of the oral arguments during the conversion application,
                    Mr Jeyaretnam SC made the following concessions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff, in setting up Xangbo,
                        had acted in breach of the Forfeiture Provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant’s TSF business is
                        non-generic, <em>ie</em>,
                    proprietary.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        defendant’s TSF business involved financial institutions and trading
                        partners all over the world.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff’s role in the defendant’s TSF
                        business was as an “initiator” or
                        “structurer”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Arising from the above concessions,
                    Mr Jeyaretnam SC accepted that the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of
                    US$1,741,894 was sought <em>solely</em> as a consequence of
                    his prayer for a declaration that the Forfeiture Provision is void and
                    severable. Mr Jeyaretnam SC further accepted that if that prayer is
                    dismissed, this action should likewise be dismissed in its entirety.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Mr Jeyaretnam SC also conceded
                    that, for the purpose of this action, any factual disputes are to be resolved in
                    favour of the defendant provided that the defendant has some evidential basis to
                    support its allegations. Without the above concessions by the plaintiff, it
                    would not have been appropriate to determine the dispute by way of OS 103/2011.
                    Given the concessions by the plaintiff, the defendant’s application to
                    convert OS 103/2011 into a writ action was rendered moot and on that basis, I
                    proceeded to hear OS 103/2011 which ultimately centres on the legal effect of
                    the Forfeiture Provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     From the above summary, the following discrete
                    questions of law arise for this court’s determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is the Forfeiture Provision in
                        substance a restraint of trade?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, is the restraint imposed by the Forfeiture
                        Provision reasonable and if not, can it be severed from the Incentive Award
                        Plan T&amp;Cs?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Are the Deferred Incentive Payments nevertheless not payable because the
                        obligation to make those payments is not supported by any
                        consideration?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the Forfeiture Provision a restraint of trade clause?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the outset, it would be useful to explain
                    the three types of clauses that will feature in this decision. The common
                    denominator of the three clauses is that they all arguably <em>appear</em> to provide for some form of restriction on competing with
                    the employer following the termination of employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first type of clause features a
                        promise by the employee not to compete with his employer
                        (“Traditional ROT Clauses”). Clause 3 of the Non-Compete
                        Agreement is a Traditional ROT Clause (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second type of clause involves the forfeiture of
                        certain benefits if the employee competes with his employer
                        (“Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses”). The Forfeiture
                        Provision is a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third type of clause forfeits
                        benefits if the employee resigns (“Payment-for-Loyalty
                        Clauses”). Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses provide for the forfeiture of
                        benefits <em>even if</em> the employee <em>does not compete</em> with the employer upon his
                        resignation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As will be apparent when the authorities are
                    examined below, while Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are largely treated in
                    the same vein as Traditional ROT Clauses, the same is not true in the case of
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses. Since the development of the doctrine of restraint
                    of trade was founded on public policy considerations, it might be apposite to
                    begin the analysis by revisiting the <em>raison
                        d’</em>ê<em>tre</em> for the doctrine in order
                    to understand whether there is a rational reason why public policy
                    considerations would be engaged in the case of Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses but not Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The genesis of the restraint of trade doctrine</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     A concise description of the genesis and
                    historical development of the doctrine may be found in Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of Contract</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th
                    Ed, 2011) (“<em>Treitel</em>”) at
                    paras 11-062–11-063, where the author explains that the doctrine once
                    held that contracts in restraint of trade were wholly void; in time, however,
                    courts began to uphold restraints of trade if they were reasonable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Contracts which prevent or regulate business competition were <b><em>at one time regarded as invariably void</em></b>; and
                        persons who made them were even threatened with imprisonment. But it came to
                        be recognised that this <b><em>inflexible attitude might defeat
                            its own ends</em></b>. A <b><em>master might be reluctant
                            to employ and train apprentices</em></b> if he could not to some
                        extent restrain them from competing with him after the end of their
                        apprenticeship. And a trader might be unable to sell the business he had
                        built up if he could not bind himself not to compete with the purchaser. The
                        courts therefore began to uphold contracts in restraint of trade, and in
                        1711 the subject was reviewed in <em>Mitchel v
                            Reynolds</em>. The effect of that case, as interpreted in later
                        decisions, was that a <b><em>restraint was prima facie valid if
                            it was supported by adequate consideration and was not
                            general</em></b> — i.e. did not extend over the whole
                        Kingdom.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Since then, the law has changed in three respects. First,
                        restraints are no longer prima facie valid; they are prima facie void but
                        can be justified if they are reasonable and not contrary to the public
                        interest. Secondly, it is no longer essential that the consideration should
                        be adequate, “though … the quantum of the consideration may
                        enter into the question of the reasonableness of the agreement”.
                        Thirdly, the rule that a restraint must not be general no longer applies.

                        (“<em>Man Financial</em>”) considered the
                    public policy underlying the restraint of trade doctrine. The Court of Appeal
                    held that the doctrine seeks to vindicate the right to <em>freedom of trade</em>, while balancing the <em>freedom
                        of contract</em> (<em>Man Financial</em> at
                        [45]). In the employment context,
                    the policy underlying the doctrine is the interest of the individual <em>and</em> the state in the free flow of expertise (<em>ibid</em>.). It would be useful to set out the relevant
                    paragraph in <em>Man Financial</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The public policy underlying the doctrine of restraint
                            of trade</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    The <em>first</em> of the
                            aforesaid aspects of public policy (<em>viz</em>,
                            that relating to the doctrine of restraint of trade) is a clearly
                            established one (for convenience of exposition, we refer to it hereafter
                            as "Public Policy 1"). This doctrine is traditionally analysed in
                            contract textbooks under the rubric of "illegality and public policy".
                            More specifically, the doctrine seeks to vindicate the legal right to
                            freedom of trade while balancing, at the same time, the countervailing
                            doctrine of freedom of contract. It remains the law, however, that
                            covenants that fall foul of the doctrine of restraint of trade will
                            (subject to certain conditions) be rendered unenforceable. To that
                            extent, the doctrine endorses (with the requisite balance) the public
                            policy which legally negates attempts to unreasonably proscribe freedom
                            of trade. Whilst we would <em>not</em> go so far as
                            to state that the doctrine of restraint of trade <em>always</em> applies in <em>every</em>
                            contractual context, we note that its application in the context of
                                <em>employment</em> is <em>well
                                established</em>. Indeed, given the strength of
                                the <em>rationale</em> for the
                            application of this doctrine in the employment context, it is, in our
                            view, clear that the doctrine would apply in this particular context
                                <em>even if</em> there has been <em>a compromise</em> of proceedings (subject to the
                            qualification set out below (especially at [65])). The rationale
                            for this is "the importance of the free flow of expertise in the context
                            of the welfare of the country as a whole: a factor that presumably
                            relates to the public interest" (see <em>Butterworths Common Law Series: The Law of
                            Contract</em> (Michael Furmston gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed,
                            2003) ("<em>Butterworths Common Law Series</em>")
                            at para 5.117). In other words, an individual's freedom to exercise
                            his skills as an employee as well as the benefit to the wider society
                            that would ensue are, in one sense at least, two equally important sides
                            of the same coin. Indeed, in the leading House of Lords decision
                                of <em>Herbert Morris, Limited v
                                Saxelby</em> [1916] 1 AC 688 ("<em>Herbert Morris</em>"), Lord Atkinson (citing the
                            judgment of Sir W M James VC in <em>Leather Cloth
                                Company v Lorsont</em> (1869) LR 9 Eq 345 at 354)
                            emphasised (at 701) that every person should be at liberty to work for
                            himself or herself, and ought not (in principle) to deprive either
                            himself or herself, <em>or</em> the State, of his
                            or her labour, skill and talents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Another statement of the policy which aptly
                    captures the balance that the doctrine seeks to strike may be found in a passage
                    in <em>Leather Cloth Company v Lorsont</em> (1869) LR
                    9 Eq 345 at 354 which Lord Atkinson in <em>Herbert Morris,
                        Limited v Saxelby</em> [1916] 1 AC 688 at 701 referred to
                    and which was, in turn, cited by the Court of Appeal in <em>Man
                        Financial</em> in the paragraph reproduced above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Public policy requires that <b><em>every man shall
                            be at liberty to work for himself, and shall not be at liberty to
                            deprive himself or the State of his labour, skill, or talent, by any
                            contract that he enters into</em></b>. On the other hand, public
                        policy requires that when a man has by skill or by any other means obtained
                        something which he wants to sell, <b><em>he should be at
                            liberty to sell it in the most advantageous way in the market; and in
                            order to enable him to sell it advantageously in the market it is
                            necessary that he should be able to preclude himself from entering into
                            competition with the purchaser</em></b>. In such a case the same
                        public policy that enables him to do that does not restrain him from
                        alienating that which he wants to alienate, and, therefore, enables him to
                        enter into any stipulation however restrictive it is, provided that
                        restriction in the judgment of the Court is <b><em>not
                            unreasonable</em></b>, having regard to the subject matter of the
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above extract acknowledges that restraints can be both
                    advantageous and disadvantageous. Restraints are useful because they make the
                    services of the party sought to be restrained more marketable. At the same time,
                    restraints are detrimental to both the individual concerned and the state
                    because the free movement of skills is curtailed. In order to strike a balance
                    between these competing tensions, the doctrine provides that restraints are
                    valid so long as they are reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cases from the UK and Australia on Forfeiture-for-Competition

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There can be no doubt that on the face of the
                    Forfeiture Provision, it does not <em>directly</em> purport
                    to prohibit the plaintiff from joining a competitor. However, Mr Jeyaretnam
                    SC’s principal submission is that the Forfeiture Provision is <em>in substance</em> a restraint of trade clause. In support, he
                    relies on a series of decisions concerning Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses.
                    The reasoning underlying these decisions is that, as a matter of substance,
                    there is no basis for distinguishing between Traditional ROT Clauses and
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses (see <em>Marshall v N M

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is important to bear in mind that the mere
                    fact that a particular clause is found to be in restraint of trade does not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> render it to be unlawful or void.
                    If it is determined to be in restraint of trade, the employer is required to
                    justify its reasonableness. In the present case, the defendant’s primary
                    submission is that the Forfeiture Provision is not in restraint of trade to
                    begin with and therefore there is no requirement to demonstrate its
                    reasonableness. It was common ground between the parties that if the court
                    accepts this principal argument that the Forfeiture Provision is not in
                    restraint of trade, the plaintiff’s claim fails in its entirety leading to
                    the dismissal of OS 103/2011. Alternatively, if it is construed to be in
                    restraint of trade, the defendant seeks to justify its
                reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I turn now to closely consider the UK and
                    Australian authorities cited by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The very first decision where a similar
                    forfeiture provision was considered is <em>Wyatt</em>. The
                    year was 1933. In that case, the employer, on retirement of the employee, wrote
                    to the employee to grant him a gratuitous pension payable by monthly instalments
                    on condition that he does not enter into the wool trade in competition with the
                    employer. The pension was paid to the employee for the next 10 years and
                    thereafter it ceased because the employer decided to reduce its “overhead
                    expenses”. The employee then sued the employer. One member of the court,
                    Scrutton LJ, found that the employer had made a gratuitous promise which did not
                    give rise to any legal obligation. The other judges (Greer and Slesser LJJ)
                        <em>assumed</em> that the promise to pay the pension
                    amounted to an enforceable agreement because counsel for the employer was not
                    asked by the judges to address the court on whether the promise was gratuitous.
                    All three members of the court were in agreement, however, that the agreement
                    was void as being in restraint of trade. It was in this context that Scrutton LJ
                    observed (at 807) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Now this agreement, stated in the most favourable form for the
                        plaintiff, namely <em>a stipulation by the employer that he
                            will pay the plaintiff so much a year if the plaintiff does not enter
                            into the wool trade for the rest of his life in any part of the country
                            or world, appears to me to be a contract in restraint of trade which is
                            unenforceable just as much as a contract by the employee not to trade in
                            the wool trade for the rest of his life in any part of the
                            world</em>, and that the country is thereby being deprived without
                        any legitimate justification of the services of a man of sixty years of age
                        who is quite competent to enter into business, because he is given leave to
                        enter into any kind of business other than the wool trade. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     
          <em>Wyatt</em> is unusual
                    in that it was the employer and <em>not</em> the employee
                    who had sought to invalidate the promise as in restraint of trade. It is
                    interesting to note that the effect of the ruling was adverse to the employee in
                    that it excused the employer from paying the pension. <em>Wyatt</em> was strongly criticised for failing to recognise that the
                    employee was in fact free to enter the wool trade and that the restraint was
                    voluntary in the sense that the employee restrained himself in order to receive
                    a benefit from the pension. This criticism was contemporaneously reported in the
                    Law Quarterly Review ((1933) 49 LQR 465 at 466):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It must be noted that the agreement, as construed by the Court,
                        was not one by which the plaintiff bound himself not to enter the wool trade
                        for a limited or unlimited time; he merely agreed not to compete as long as
                        he accepted the pension. His liberty of action was completely unfettered,
                        for, at any moment, he might refuse the pension and return to the trade. Why
                        then did the Court hold that the agreement was against public policy? The
                        reason is stated as follows by Slesser LJ at p 809: ‘It seems to
                        me that to say to a man that he should be deprived of a benefit if he fails
                        to restrain himself from entering into a particular trade, when such
                        restraint would be a general restraint, is just as much contrary to public
                        policy and deprives the public of his services as much as if he made an
                        express covenant not to enter that trade.’ The learned Lord Justice
                        adds: ‘In such matters it is well to go back to principle, and the
                        principle is nowhere better stated than by Lord Macnaghten in <em>Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt, etc Co</em>
                        [1894] AC 535, 565, where he says this: “All interference
                        with individual liberty of action in trading, and all restraints of trade
                        themselves, if there is nothing more, are contrary to public policy, and
                        therefore void.”’ No one can doubt that this is a correct
                        statement of the law, but how is it applicable to the present case? What
                        interference with individual liberty is there if the pensioner is at any
                        time free to enter the trade on giving up the pension? <em>The restraint at best is a voluntary one, for the only interference
                            with liberty is that the promisee ‘restrains himself’ (a
                            somewhat peculiar phrase) because of the greater benefit to be got from
                            the pension</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Thereafter, this area of the law remained
                    somewhat dormant for the next three decades until a similar issue arose for
                    determination in <em>Pitney-Bowes.</em> In that case, the
                    employee had made compulsory contributions to a pension scheme for a number of
                    years. Later the scheme was changed whereby all employees were entitled to
                    pension upon retirement without having to pay any further contributions.
                    However, it was a term of the new pension scheme that the employee would lose
                    his rights and benefits to the scheme if he were engaged in any activity that
                    was in competition with the employer. Thesiger J held (at 282H) that he was
                    bound by the decision in <em>Wyatt</em>. Further he found
                    that the criticisms which were directed at <em>Wyatt</em>
                    in 1933 “were based on conditions of employment and of the economy
                    (within the jurisdiction of this court) which no longer
                prevail.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I should add that <em>Pitney-Bowes</em> was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Man Financial</em> for the proposition that
                    “the courts will not allow employers to achieve by <em>indirect</em> means what they cannot otherwise do through direct
                    means” [emphasis in original] (see <em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [93]). This uncontroversial proposition stems from
                    the indisputable rule that the inquiry as to whether a clause operates in
                    restraint of trade is to be examined by reference to substance and not form.
                    This was eloquently articulated by the Privy Council in <em>Stenhouse</em> (at 140H) where Lord Wilberforce observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Whether a particular provision operates in restraint of trade is
                        to be determined not by the form the stipulation wears, but, as the
                        statement of the question itself shows, by its effect in practice.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I turn now to consider the decision in
                        <em>Stenhouse</em> which provides a useful illustration
                    as to when a clause which does not directly prohibit the freedom of an employee
                    to join a competitor could, in substance, be construed as a restraint of trade.
                    In <em>Stenhouse</em>, the Managing Director of an
                    insurance broking company entered into an agreement with the company when he
                    left its employment. Clause 4 of the agreement provided that the Managing
                    Director would not for a period of five years solicit insurance business from
                    the company's clients. Clause 5 provided that in the event that any client of
                    the company should within a period of five years, place insurance business so
                    that the Managing Director received or became entitled to receive directly or
                    indirectly any financial benefit from the placing of such business, then he
                    agreed to pay to the company a one-half share of the gross commission he
                    received in respect of the transaction. The provision in dispute was not,
                    therefore, a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause. The Privy Council rejected the
                    company’s argument that clause 5 was merely a provision of payment of
                    monies pursuant to a profit sharing agreement. Significantly, the Privy Council
                    (at 141A) offered some guidance as to when a clause which on its face may not
                    appear to be in restraint of trade could in substance be construed as
                    one:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The clause in question here contains no direct covenant to
                        abstain from any kind of competition or business, but the question to be
                        answered is whether, in effect, <em>it is likely to cause the
                            employee to refuse business which otherwise he would take: or, looking
                            at it in another way, whether the existence of this provision would
                            diminish his prospects of employment</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Next, the defendant also submitted that the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Marshall</em> held
                    “that a contract which made payments of commissions earned by a self
                    employed agent, payable post termination of an agreement, conditional on,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the agent not competing within a
                    year of the termination, was in restraint of trade”. This is strictly
                    incorrect. The decision was on appeal from the ruling of Jonathan Sumption QC
                    sitting as a deputy High Court Judge. Millett LJ in <em>Marshall</em> specifically observed (at 1530E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In relation to renewal commission the deputy judge held as follows. (1)
                        Clause 10(g)(i) is in unreasonable restraint of trade and is void. There is
                        no appeal from this ruling. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was therefore the English High Court’s decision in <em>Marshall</em> (see <em>Marshall v N
                        </em><em>M Financial Management</em> [1995]
                    1 WLR 1461 (“<em>Marshall
                    (HC)</em>”) which is more relevant for present
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Marshall</em>, the
                    employee was a self-employed sales agent engaged in selling life insurance and
                    pension policies. A term of his contract provided that after termination, the
                    employee should continue to receive commission in respect of premium payments
                    made by investors he had previously introduced to the company but payment of
                    such commission was, however, stated to be conditional on, <em>inter alia</em>, the employee not within one year of such termination
                    becoming an independent intermediary or being employed by any organisation which
                    was in competition with the company. Sumption QC relied on <em>Wyatt</em> and found the clause to be in restraint of trade (see
                        <em>Marshall (HC)</em> at 1465):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think that there can be any doubt that proviso (i) is a restraint
                        of trade. It has been well established since the decision of the Court of
                        Appeal in <em>Wyatt v. Kreglinger and Fernau</em>
                        [1933] 1 K.B. 793   that there is no relevant difference between a
                        contract that a person will not carry on a particular trade and a contract
                        that if he does not do so he will receive some benefit to which he would not
                        otherwise be entitled. Proviso (i) is a financial incentive to the agent not
                        to carry on business in the specified fields. It is therefore unlawful
                        unless it is justified as being reasonable in the interests of the parties
                        and in that of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, the above reasoning, which assumed the correctness of
                        <em>Wyatt</em>, does not add anything further to the
                    remarks made in <em>Wyatt.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Finally, the decision in <em>Sadler</em> likewise does not provide any further guidance on the
                    issue before me. In <em>Sadler</em>, the employee was an
                    insurance agent who was remunerated on a commission basis payable in respect of
                    premiums paid during the first ten years of the policy on a reducing basis. It
                    was a term of the contract of employment that post-termination commission would
                    not be payable to the employee if he should enter into a contract of employment
                    with another company involved in the selling of insurance. The employee
                    admittedly breached it when he joined a competitor upon leaving the employment
                    of the company. The company refused to pay the post-termination commission and
                    the employee sued the company claiming that the contractual term constituted an
                    unlawful restraint of trade. The company in response claimed that the clause did
                    not deprive the employee of any freedom to join a competitor. In allowing the
                    claim, the English High Court found the decisions in <em>Wyatt</em> and <em>Pitney-Bowes</em> to be
                    “impossible to distinguish” and, consequently, the financial
                    incentive to limit the employee’s activities was found to be in restraint
                    of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     From the review of the cases relied on by the
                    plaintiff, it is apparent that, apart from <em>Stenhouse</em>, they can be traced to the observations made in
                        <em>Wyatt</em> which the subsequent cases found either
                    to be binding or impossible to distinguish. While it is true that this court is
                    not bound by <em>Wyatt</em>, it is equally true that if the
                    reasoning in <em>Wyatt</em> is indeed sound, it is not
                    incorrect for the subsequent cases to have regarded it as “impossible to
                    distinguish”. My task is to evaluate from all persuasive sources whether
                    the reasoning in <em>Wyatt</em> resonates with the public
                    policy that the restraint of trade doctrine was designed to
                protect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">United States cases on Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As I had observed earlier, the legal position
                    in the United States on this issue is divided. Predictably, each party referred
                    me to decisions which supported their respective cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The first case from the United States cited by
                    the plaintiff is <em>Jeffrey A </em><em>Z
                        Hilligoss</em><b><em></em></b><em>v</em><b><em></em></b><em>Cargill Incorporated et al</em> 2001 Minn
                    App LEXIS 1017. As the title of the case suggests, this decision involved the
                    defendant’s parent company in the United States, Cargill Incorporated
                    (“Cargill Inc”). An employee of Cargill Inc was terminated. The
                    employee sued, <em>inter alia</em>, for the unpaid amount
                    of his deferred bonuses. The relevant contract between the employee and Cargill
                    Inc contained a provision similar to the Forfeiture Provision. Cargill Inc
                    alleged that the employee was not entitled to the unpaid amount because he was
                    terminated for cause and he competed with Cargill Inc. The jury found against
                    Cargill Inc. Cargill Inc filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding
                    the verdict and, alternatively, for a new trial. The court dismissed the
                    post-trial motions. Cargill Inc appealed, seeking, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a new trial because the District Court erred in excluding
                    evidence of competition. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that the
                    District Court did not err in this regard because the termination letter stated
                    that the employee would not be paid the unpaid amount of his deferred bonus
                    because he was terminated for cause and not because the employee competed
                    against Cargill Inc. More significantly, another reason why the District Court
                    did not err was that the non-competition clause was overly broad. It did not
                    matter that the provision was in the nature of a forfeiture rather than a
                    prohibition (citing <em>Ralph S Harris v Myron R Bolin (as
                        Trustee of M R Bolin Advertising Public Relations Agency Inc Profit
                        Sharing Trust) and others</em> 310 Minn 391 (“<em>Harris</em>”)). The decision of the Court of Appeals
                    was appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota (see <em>Jeffrey A
                        Z Hilligoss v Cargill, Incorporated</em> 649 NW2d 142). The judgment
                    of the Supreme Court of Minnesota dealt with different issues. It did not
                    consider whether the Forfeiture Provision was “overly broad”. This
                    decision is therefore not helpful to the key issue before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I turn next to <em>Harris</em>. In this case, an employee of an advertising firm was
                    entitled to share in profits. Part of his share of profits was vested. The
                    profit sharing plan provided that the vested portion of his profits would be
                    forfeited, at the trustee’s discretion, if he left the firm and joined a
                    competitor. The employee left the firm and the trustee forfeited his vested
                    share of profits. The employee sued. The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that
                    the District Court correctly found that the forfeiture provision in the plan was
                    an illegal restraint of trade (<em>Harris</em> at 395). The
                    court referred to an Illinois decision and a federal decision (<em>Rochester Corporation v Rochester</em> (1971) 450 F2d 118
                        (“<em>Rochester</em>”)) which upheld
                    forfeiture clauses. It disagreed with those cases because they were “not
                    consistent with the posture [the Supreme Court of Minnesota] has taken in
                    enforcing only reasonable employee covenants not to compete” (<em>Harris</em> at 394). The Supreme Court of Minnesota also
                    referred, in a footnote, to the reasoning in <em>Rochester</em> in which a distinction was drawn between Traditional
                    ROT Clauses and Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses. The Supreme Court of
                    Minnesota found however, that the “purpose of both arrangements are the
                    same” and hence they could only be enforced if they were reasonable
                        (<em>Harris</em> at footnote 3). This reasoning is
                    reminiscent of the reasoning in the English cases that
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are, in substance, restraints of
                    trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In his reply skeletal arguments,
                    Mr Jeyaretnam SC referred to several additional United States cases. In
                        <em>Amory H Bradford v The New York Times Company</em>
                    (1974) 501 F2d 51, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (a
                    federal appellate court applying New York state law) applied the restraint of
                    trade doctrine to a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause in an incentive plan. The
                    incentive plan provided for the distribution of shares in the company in 10
                    equal annual instalments. In the event of a breach, the company had the sole
                    discretion to discontinue further instalments. The court reasoned that the
                    relevant provision was a restraint of trade because it limited the
                    employee’s employment opportunities. The court did not accept the
                    “employee choice” doctrine because of New York’s
                    “strong public policy”. In any case, the court considered that the
                    clause could not be characterised as one which gave the employee a choice of
                    alternative performance. The clause was held to be a restraint of trade with a
                    provision for liquidated damages in the form of a forfeiture in the event of a
                    breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The next case referred to in the
                    plaintiff’s reply skeletal arguments is <em>John J Cheney v
                        Automatic Sprinkler Corporation of America</em> (1979) 377 Mass
                    141 (“<em>John J Cheney</em>”) where the
                    Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts applied the restraint of trade doctrine
                    to a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause in a compensation plan. The compensation
                    plan deferred a portion of the employee’s incentive payments for a period
                    of four years. The deferred portions would be forfeited if the employee left the
                    company to, <em>inter alia</em>, compete with it. The court
                    noted that the “majority view” in the US was that
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are enforceable “without regard to the
                    reasonableness of the restraint”. The court nevertheless held that the
                    restraint of trade doctrine was applicable because of an imbalance in the
                    bargaining positions of parties to such agreements. This imbalance was
                    particularly true on the facts of the case because the
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause was present in an annual agreement which was
                    presented to the employee annually. The employee’s option was to either
                    sign the agreement <em>or terminate his employment</em>. I
                    pause here to note that there is no evidence in the present case that the
                    plaintiff was presented with such a quandary. In fact, the evidence before me
                    suggested that the plaintiff had the option not to sign the Incentive Award Plan

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Diane P Deming v
                        Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company et al and other matters</em>
                    (2006) 279 Conn 745 (“<em>Diane P
                    Deming</em>”), one of the issues that the Supreme Court of
                    Connecticut had to consider was whether the restraint of trade doctrine applied
                    to a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which forfeited deferred compensation if
                    the employee competed with the employer. The court noted that the
                    “majority view” is that such forfeiture provisions are not
                    restraints of trade (<em>Diane P Deming</em> at 762). The
                    majority view reasons that the employee is not prohibited from competing.
                    Instead, the employee is merely denied the right to participate in a plan if he
                    competed. Therefore, the employee and the public are not deprived of the
                    employee’s skills. However, a “significant minority” of
                    jurisdictions take the view that such provisions are restraints of trade because
                    the effect of the provisions is to present a “powerful deterrent”
                    to the employee’s right to compete (<em>Diane P
                        Deming</em> at 763). The court concluded that the provision
                    “does not differ meaningfully from a covenant not to compete”.
                    Although the provision is not directly a restraint of trade, the consequences of
                    the forfeiture “enkindle[s] a restraining influence, albeit in a subtle
                    fashion” (<em>Diane P Deming</em> at 768 citing
                        <em>Almers v South Carolina National Bank of
                        Charleston</em> 265 SC 51).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc et
                        al v Greeley</em> (1972) 264 Md 105 (“<em>Food
                        Fair Stores</em>”), the Court of Appeals of Maryland had to
                    consider whether a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which forfeited retirement
                    benefits was a restraint of trade. The court held that the clause was a
                    restraint of trade. The court reasoned that whether the restraint is in an
                    employment contract, backed by legal sanctions, or by way of a forfeiture of
                    pension benefits, the employee is made to suffer economic loss should he breach
                    the restrictive covenant (see <em>Food Fair Stores</em> at
                    116).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Lavey v Edwards et al
                        and other matters</em> (1973) 264 Ore 331 (“<em>Lavey</em>”), the Supreme Court of Oregon applied the
                    restraint of trade doctrine to a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which
                    forfeited pension contributions by the employer in the event that the employee
                    competed. The reasons for the application of the doctrine are not clear from the
                    judgment. The court focused on a different issue: <em>viz</em>, whether such clauses are void <em>per
                        se</em> or whether a test of reasonableness should be applied (the
                    trial court had held that the clauses were void as a matter of law; the Supreme
                    Court of Oregon remitted the case for the court to consider whether the clause
                    was reasonable).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Richard C Pollard v
                        Autotote Ltd</em> (1988) 852 F2d 67 (“<em>Richard C Pollard</em>”), the United States Court of
                    Appeals for the Second Circuit (a federal appellate court applying Delaware
                    state law) had to consider whether a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which
                    forfeited deferred management incentive payments in the event of competition was
                    enforceable. The trial court had granted summary judgment in favour of the
                    employer. Since there was no Delaware case law on point, the court had to
                    predict what a Delaware court would have done in construing such a
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause. The court held that Delaware courts would
                    subject such clauses to a reasonableness standard. Delaware courts would have
                    applied the reasonableness standard to covenants not to compete. Since covenants
                    not to compete are similar to Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses (because both
                    types of clauses restrict the employee’s freedom to choose alternative
                    employment), the court held that Delaware courts would have also subjected
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses to the same standard (<em>Richard C Pollard</em> at 71). Since it was not clear whether the
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause was reasonable, the court reversed the grant
                    of summary judgment and remitted the matter for a trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Securitas Security
                        Services USA, Inc v Kenneth Jenkins</em> (2003) 16 Mass L Rep
                    486, the Superior Court of Massachusetts held that under Massachusetts law,
                    courts must apply a reasonableness standard to Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses. The court did not, however, engage in any discussion as to why the
                    restraint of trade doctrine applies to such clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The final United States case that the
                    plaintiff referred me to was <em>Gene W Sheppard v Blackstock
                        Lumber Company Inc</em> (1975) 85 Wn2d 929 (“<em>Gene W Sheppard</em>”), where the Supreme Court of Washington
                    had to determine the enforceability of a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which
                    forfeited an employee’s undrawn share in a profit-sharing retirement plan
                    in the event that he competed with the employer. The trial court granted the
                    employer summary judgment. The court held that a reasonableness test applied
                    because the clause had an “inhibitive influence on an employee’s
                    decision whether to accept a new job” (<em>Gene W
                        Sheppard</em> at 932). The court also noted that the new employment
                    would, oftentimes, not compensate the employee for his loss of benefits
                        (<em>ibid</em>). The court remitted the matter for a
                    trial in the lower courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I turn now to the United States cases cited by
                    the defendant. The first is <em>Richard Fraser d/b/a R A
                        Fraser Agency and another v Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co et al</em>
                    (2004) 334 F Supp 2d 755 (“<em>Richard
                    Fraser</em>”) where the District Court for the Eastern District of
                    Pennsylvania (a federal court) had to consider whether a
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which forfeited an insurance agent’s
                    deferred compensation due to his competition with his former employer was a
                    restraint of trade under Pennsylvania law. The court reasoned that the clause
                    allowed the agent to <em>choose</em> whether to compete. As
                    a “rational actor”, the agent must have weighed the costs and
                    benefits of each option (<em>Richard Fraser</em> at 760).
                    As will be seen, this reasoning is often repeated in the United States cases
                    cited by the defendant. I shall refer to this reasoning as “the Employee
                    Choice Rationale”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The next case cited by the defendant is
                        <em>John W Johnson v MPR Associates Inc</em> (1994) 894
                    F Supp 255 (“<em>John W Johnson</em>”) which
                    concerned a provision in an employee stock transfer agreement under which
                    employees received shares in their employer. The stock transfer agreement
                    contained a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause which required the employee to
                    tender his shares if he joined a competitor. The District Court for the Eastern
                    District of Virginia (a federal court) held that the provision was <em>not</em> a restraint of trade. The court reasoned that the
                    provision only denied the employee of a benefit. The provision did not prohibit
                    competition (<em>John W Johnson</em> at 257, citing
                        <em>Rochester</em>). This is another way of saying that
                    the employee had a choice to compete, albeit that the choice carried with it a
                    denial of a benefit. The court’s reasoning is therefore, in substance, an
                    application of the Employee Choice Rationale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In <em>Milton J Kristt
                        </em><em>(Individually and as a Representative under a
                        Deed of Trust) v John J Whelan et al (as Trustees under a Deed of
                        Trust)</em> (1957) 4 AD2d 195 (“<em>Milton J
                        Kristt</em>”), a company set up a trust. The plaintiff, an
                    employee, was given an interest in the trust. The trust deed was amended to
                    provide that the trustees, upon the request of the company, were to forfeit the
                    interest of a beneficiary if that beneficiary competed with the company. The
                    plaintiff terminated his employment with the company and competed with it. His
                    trust interests were then forfeited. The Supreme Court of New York Appellate
                    Division (this is an intermediate court) held that the amendment to the trust
                    was not contrary to public policy and did not restrain competition. The employee
                    was not barred from competing. He had a choice (<em>Milton J
                        Kristt</em> at 199). This is another application of the Employee
                    Choice Rationale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Finally, in <em>Rochester</em>, a decision referred to in <em>Harris</em> (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>, above),
                    the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (a federal appellate court) had to
                    consider whether a provision in a retirement plan which forfeited pension
                    benefits if the employee competed was a restraint of trade under Virginia law.
                    The court held that the forfeiture was <em>not</em> a
                    restraint of trade because the employee was not prohibited from competing. He
                    was merely denied the right to participate in the retirement plan (<em>Rochester</em> at 123). Again, this is, in substance, an
                    application of the Employee Choice Rationale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The following points have emerged from my
                    analysis of the relevant United States cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cases holding that the restraint
                        of trade doctrine applies to Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses generally
                        apply the English reasoning that the clauses are, in substance, restraints
                        of trade because their effect is the curtailment of competition (see
                            <em>Harris</em>, <em>Diane P Deming,
                            Food Fair Stores</em>, <em>Richard C
                            Pollard</em> and <em>Gene W Sheppard</em>).
                        One case, <em>John J Cheney</em> (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above), refers to the imbalance in
                        bargaining power between employer and employee as a justification for the
                        application of the doctrine. I note, however, that this reasoning seems to
                        have been prompted by the particularly harsh circumstances in that case: the
                        employee had to either accept the agreement containing the
                        Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause or terminate his employment. As I have
                        noted above (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>), there is no
                        evidence that the plaintiff faced a similar situation in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The cases
                        that determined that the doctrine does not apply typically adopt the
                        Employee Choice Rationale, <em>viz</em>, that the
                        employee has a choice in determining whether he wants to compete and, as a
                        rational actor, is presumed to have weighed the costs and benefits of
                        competing with his former employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     To conclude this discussion on the position in
                    the United States, I should say that the <em>majority
                        view</em> in the United States is that the restraint of trade doctrine
                    does <em>not</em> apply to Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses, as one of the leading treatises on contract law in the United States
                    notes (<em>Corbin on Contracts</em> vol 15
                    (LexisNexis, 2003) (“<em>Corbin on
                    Contracts</em>”) at §80.25):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Conditions in Restraint of
                        Competition</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In contrast to conditions applying to a covenant not to compete that a
                        court must judge by the reasonableness standard, conditions not applying to
                        a covenant not to compete need not be tested by a reasonableness analysis,
                        though there may be anticompetitive effect. A typical scenario is as
                        follows: A sells the business to B, receiving $100,000 in cash and also
                        B’s promise to pay to A an annuity of $5,000 as long as A forbears to
                        open a business in competition. A has made no promise of any kind, neither a
                        promise not to open a business nor a promise to pay money conditional on
                        such an opening. Yet the transaction has a restraining influence. B’s
                        promise of an annuity, conditional on forbearance to open a business, tends
                        to restrain A from competition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given this restraining effect, one might expect courts to analyze these
                        arrangements as restraints on competition, which must be reasonable to be
                        enforced. <em>The majority of courts addressing the issue,
                            however, automatically uphold anticompetitive conditions in this context
                            without regard to reasonableness, applying an employee-choice
                            doctrine.</em> In the typical scenario, an employer provides a
                            <em>deferred compensation plan</em> for certain
                        employees. An employee covered by the plan receives deferred compensation in
                        accordance with the plan unless that employee competes against the employer
                        in some specified way. If the employee participates in prohibited activity,
                        that employee forfeits the deferred compensation. In cases involving this
                        scenario, courts refuse to subject the arrangement to a reasonableness
                        analysis because the forfeiture does not prevent the employee from
                        competing. Rather, the employee has the choice of competing or keeping the
                        deferred compensation benefits. <em>As one court has stated:
                            “The provision for forfeiture here involved did not bar plaintiff
                            from other employment. He had the choice of preserving his rights under
                            the trust by refraining from competition with [his employer] … or
                            risk forfeiture of such rights by exercising his right to compete with
                            [the employer].”</em> While some courts note that these
                        conditions are part of a compensation or pension plan rather than a part of
                        an employment agreement and thus courts should treat them differently, one
                        court has admitted that the “divestiture provision in the Plan
                        operates as a short term (six month) covenant not to compete.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, some of the cases I have referred to above have also noted
                    that the majority position in the United States is that the restraint of trade
                    doctrine does <em>not</em> apply to
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses (see <em>John J
                        Cheney</em>, above at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> and
                        <em>Diane P Deming</em>, above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Academic views and commentary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The leading textbooks on English contract law
                    do not question the correctness of the view in cases such as <em>Wyatt</em> and <em>Pitney-Bowes</em> that the
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are restraints of trade (see <em>Butterworths Common Law Series: The Law of Contract</em>
                    (Michael Furmston gen ed) (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Butterworths</em>”) at para 5.12 (“…the
                    courts will not allow employers to achieve by <em>indirect</em> means what they could not otherwise have obtained by
                    direct means”; citing <em>Pitney-Bowes</em>);
                        <em>Treitel</em> at para 11-083 (“[t]he

                    promise to do so…”; citing <em>Wyatt</em>);
                    and M.P. Furmston (ed) <em>Chesire, Fifoot and Furmston’s

                        <em>Pitney-Bowes</em>)). It should be noted that
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th
                    Ed, 2008) and Sir Jack Beatson <em>et al, Anson’s Law of
                        Contract</em> (Oxford University Press, 29th Ed, 2010) do not
                    expressly consider whether Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are restraints of
                    trade although both treatises cite <em>Wyatt</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I should mention that there are articles from
                    the UK which support the view that Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are, in
                    substance, restraints of trade (Stephen A Smith, “Reconstructing
                    Restraint of Trade” (1995) 15 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 565 at
                    568 and K L Koh, “Pension Funds and Restraint of Trade” (1967) 30
                    Modern Law Review 587 at 589).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Court’s analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     From the above review of the cases from the
                    various jurisdictions as well as academic commentaries, it appears to me that my
                    decision would ultimately depend on whether I regard the Forfeiture Provision as
                    in substance a restraint of trade or whether I am persuaded by the Employee
                    Choice Rationale. In addressing the issue of whether the Forfeiture Provision
                    was in substance a restraint of trade, it is crucial not to lose sight of the
                    public policy considerations which engendered the doctrine in the first
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On its face, Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses do not <em>prohibit</em> the employee from
                    competing with the employer. Instead they operate as a <em>financial disincentive</em> for the employee to compete after he
                    leaves the employer. If the plaintiff decides to compete upon leaving the
                    employment of the defendant with full knowledge of the financial disincentive,
                        <em>ie</em>, the forfeiture of his Deferred Incentive
                    Award, then he would have made a calculated business decision that he would
                    nonetheless be better off financially working for a competitor. In other words,
                    he would have evaluated the detriment of losing the deferred bonus against the
                    gain in joining the competitor. As aptly observed in the case cited in the
                    extract from <em>Corbin on Contracts</em> reproduced above
                    (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above) the plaintiff had the
                    choice of preserving his rights under the Incentive Award Plan by refraining
                    from competition with the defendant or risk forfeiture of his deferred bonus by
                    exercising his right to compete. It seems to me that there is no compelling
                    public policy that requires the court to intervene to hold the Forfeiture
                    Provision as in restraint of trade when in truth there was no restraint in form
                    or substance to speak of. The plaintiff was completely at liberty to compete
                    with the defendant and had in fact done so when he set up a competing business
                    in Xangbo. There is therefore no question of society being deprived of his skill
                    and competency which is the cornerstone behind the restraint of trade doctrine.
                    I should add that a similar argument was raised and apparently rejected in
                        <em>Finnegan</em> (a case cited by the plaintiff
                    – see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>, above) where the employer
                    sought to unilaterally and retrospectively amend the employee’s
                    entitlement to bonus by deferring the payment of a substantial portion of the
                    bonus provided the employee did not in the meantime join a competitor. The right
                    to defer the payment was challenged on the basis that the amendment had no legal
                    effect since the employee was not given any notice and alternatively it operated
                    as an unreasonable restraint of trade. Smyth J made several factual findings, in
                    particular that the employee had a legitimate and reasonable expectation to
                    bonus payments depending on the performance of the company and the employee and,
                    more importantly, that the employee had <em>not</em> agreed
                    to the deferral of the bonus payments. It was argued by the company that the
                    deferral payments were primarily an “economic disincentive or
                    discouragement from leaving, or put positively, providing an economic incentive
                    to stay with the Defendant company.” The argument was however rejected by
                    Smyth J (at p 8 of the LexisNexis transcript) where he remarked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am unable to accept this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment there was, on the evidence, n<em>o genuine proprietary interest of Davys that required the
                            imposition of the provision imposed upon the Plaintiff</em>.
                        Costelloe J. (as he then was) said in John Orr Ltd. -v- Orr [1987] ILRM702
                        as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“All restraints of trade in the absence of special justifying
                            circumstances are contrary to public policy and are therefore void. A
                            restraint may be justified if it is reasonable in the interests of the
                            contracting parties and in the interests of the public. The onus of
                            showing that a restraint is reasonable between the parties rests on the
                            person alleging that it is so. Greater freedom of contract is allowable
                            in a covenant entered into between a seller and a buyer of a business
                            than in the case of one entered into between an employer and an
                            employee. A covenant against competition entered into by the seller of a
                            business which is reasonably necessary to protect the business sold is
                            valid and enforceable. A covenant by an employee not to compete may also
                            be valid and enforceable if it is reasonably necessary to protect some
                            proprietary interest of the covenantee such as may exist in a trade
                            connection or trade secrets. The Court may in certain circumstances
                            enforce a covenant in restraint of trade even though taken as a whole
                            the covenant exceeds what was reasonable while the severance of the void
                            parts from the valid parts.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     From the judgment, it was not entirely clear
                    why the argument was rejected by Smyth J. In the next paragraph of his judgment,
                    he proceeded to find that there was no proprietary interest which justified
                    protection. To the extent that the submission was rejected on the basis that
                    there was no proprietary interest to be protected, with respect, I am unable to
                    follow the reasoning since the issue as to the presence or absence of a
                    proprietary interest only comes into play <em>after</em>
                    the clause has been found to be in restraint of trade. In my view, a finding
                    that there was no genuine proprietary interest that required protection has no
                    bearing to the <em>prior</em> question as to whether the
                    deferred payment was merely an economic incentive to stay with the company.
                    Having said that, it might well be that the finding on the absence of any
                    proprietary interest was unrelated to the rejection of the submission and if so,
                    then it is unclear to me why it was rejected. Ultimately the decision was
                    undoubtedly correct in that the employee had not agreed to the deferred payment
                    scheme which was found to have been unilaterally and retrospectively imposed on
                    the employee. Smyth J recognised (at p 6 of the LexisNexis transcript) that
                    the position might well be different if the employee had agreed to the deferred
                    payment scheme:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In <em>Horkulak</em> [<em>ie</em>,<em>Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald
                            International</em> [2005] 1 CR 402] the particular bonus scheme
                        had a number of features that may be common in some respects to the
                        Defendant's bonus scheme. In particular, the Cantor Fitzgerald scheme (as
                        did the Defendant's) contained a proviso that the employee continued to be
                        employed at the payment date of the bonus, which was deferred for a period
                        after its determination. <em>In my judgment this is clearly
                            distinguishable from the instant case because Horkulak's contract was
                            (a) in writing and (b) the term was known to him and it was known to him
                            from the outset.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Forfeiture Provision, in my view, merely
                    contractually defines when the plaintiff loses his entitlement to the Deferred
                    Incentive Payments. Adopting the test laid down in <em>Stenhouse</em>, the Forfeiture Provision was not likely to cause the
                    plaintiff “<em>to refuse business which otherwise he would
                        take</em>” or, “<em>would diminish his
                        prospects of employment</em>” (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). Unlike the employee in <em>Finnegan</em>, the plaintiff specifically agreed to abide by the
                    terms of the Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs. He had a <em>choice</em> not to accept the Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs which is
                    separate and distinct from the Employment Contract and had a <em>further choice</em> having agreed to the Incentive Award Plan
                    T&amp;Cs to compete with the defendant after leaving the defendant’s
                    employment. The only consequence from the exercise of his choice to compete is
                    that he has to be held to his bargain in forgoing his Deferred Incentive
                    Payments. In the words of counsel for the defendant, Ms Blossom Hing
                    (“Ms Hing”), the plaintiff simply cannot “have his
                    cake and eat it too.” Employees such as the plaintiff would presumably
                    have acted rationally by weighing the benefit of competitive employment against
                    the cost of forfeiture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is imperative not to lose sight that the
                    doctrine of restraint of trade entails a balancing exercise between two
                    competing rights, <em>ie</em>, freedom of trade and freedom
                    of contract (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>, above). To hold the
                    Forfeiture Provision as in substance a restraint of trade would attach
                    unjustifiable weight to the right of freedom of trade at the expense of the
                    equally important countervailing right of freedom of contract. Employers also
                    deserve some protection from opportunistic employees. Just to be clear, there is
                    nothing wrong for an employee to be opportunistic. By the same token, there is
                    nothing wrong in the employer forfeiting the deferred bonus in accordance with
                    the contract when the employee, acting in his self-interest, exercises his right
                    to pursue new and better opportunities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Further, it is not unreasonable to expect
                    highly qualified employees like the plaintiff to negotiate with their new
                    employers to compensate them for the loss of such deferred bonus as a condition
                    for joining them. Although this point does not arise in this case because the
                    plaintiff had set up a competing business instead of joining a competitor, it is
                    nonetheless a relevant factor to bear in mind when deciding whether the public
                    policy considerations are engaged in the first place. This was in fact
                    specifically highlighted in <em>Hairman v FileNET
                        </em><em>Corporation Pty Ltd</em> [2001]
                    NSWIRComm 318 (“<em>Hairman</em>”) (which is
                    discussed below at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>) where the New South
                    Wales Industrial Relations Commission observed at [129] that “the loss of
                    such an inducement can even enable an employee headhunted by another employer,
                    to negotiate more favourable terms in the new employment”. If the new
                    employer is prepared to do so then there would be no loss to the employee. But
                    if the new employer is not prepared to do so and yet the employee elects to
                    exercise his right to compete by joining the competitor, then he should bear the
                    full financial consequences of his informed decision. There is nothing
                    inherently unfair with such an outcome. Accordingly, I hold that the Forfeiture
                    Provision was neither in form nor in substance in restraint of
                trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I should add for completeness that the amount
                    of deferred bonus to be forfeited is not relevant to the inquiry whether the
                    Forfeiture Provision was in restraint of trade. In this case, the outstanding
                    Deferred Incentive Payment is US$1,741,894 which is a substantial sum. The
                    amount would, however, be a relevant consideration in determining its
                    reasonableness if it was found to be in restraint of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In arriving at my decision that the Forfeiture
                    Provision was not in restraint of trade, I am also persuaded by decisions on
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses that ruled that they are not in restraint of trade.
                    I now turn my attention to examine those decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses have consistently
                    been upheld by the courts in the UK and Australia as not being in restraint of
                    trade. It is relevant to point out that the validity of such clauses was
                    challenged on those occasions on the premise that such clauses were in substance
                    in restraint of trade. However, on every such challenge, the courts have
                    consistently rejected the argument. On the other hand, in the cases concerning
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses, the cases involving Payment-for-Loyalty
                    Clauses were not cited in aid of the argument that such clauses (<em>ie</em>, Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses) were not in
                    restraint of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The reasoning behind the courts’
                    decisions upholding Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses can be gleaned from the
                    following cases. In <em>Peninsula Business Services Ltd v
                        Sweeney</em> (2003) EAT/1096/02/SM (“<em>Peninsula</em>”), it was an express term of the employment
                    contract that sales representatives would only be paid their commission at the
                    end of the calendar month when the commission payment would normally become
                    payable and provided that the sales representative is still in the employment of
                    the company at the end of the calendar month when the commission would normally
                    become payable. The UK Employment Tribunal found, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the clause amounted to a restraint of trade. On appeal
                    by the company, the UK Employment Appeal Tribunal disagreed and held at
                        [42] and [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    … We do not consider it seriously arguable
                            that the commission penalty that Mr Sweeney [<em>ie</em>, the sales representative] suffered on resignation
                            arose under a contractual term involving an unlawful restraint of trade.
                                <em>His employment contract did not impose any
                                restraint on him as to whom he might work for, or what he might do,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    … We hold that nothing in section B was void

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Similarly in <em>Tullet
                        </em><em>Prebon plc and others v BGC Brokers LP and

                    whether a contractual provision which required the brokers to return retention
                    payments when the brokers left the employment within a certain period of time
                    was in restraint of trade. The court in refusing to treat such provisions as in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The provisions which provide for the repayment of signing or retention

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I turn now to two Australian authorities
                    considering Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses. The first is <em>Hairman</em>, which is not, strictly, a case on restraint of trade.
                    In <em>Hairman</em>, the employee’s remuneration
                    comprised a mix of salary as well as commission payments under a sales incentive
                    plan. Like the present case, the sales incentive plan was updated annually and
                    the employee was required to accept the terms in writing which would entitle the
                    employee to receive 55 per cent of the commission upon booking of the order and
                    the balance 45 per cent upon payment by the customer provided the employee
                    remained in employment. In <em>Hairman</em>, the employee
                    who left the employment sought to recover the balance 45 per cent commission by
                    challenging the sales incentive plan as being unfair under s 106 of the
                    Industrial Relations Act 1996 (No 17 of 1996) (NSW) (“the NSW
                    Act”). One of the arguments raised by the employee was that the
                    commission scheme was unfair because it had the effect of restraining employees
                    from leaving employment (see <em>Hairman</em> at [49]). Again, like the present case, the
                    employee received part payment of the commission, <em>ie</em>, the 55 per cent commission upon booking the order. The New
                    South Wales Industrial Relations Commission found that the clause which
                    forfeited the balance commission upon resignation was not a restraint. It is not
                    clear from the commission’s opinion whether this was an argument that the
                    clause was a restraint <em>of trade</em> attracting the
                    application of the <em>restraint of trade doctrine</em> or
                    a <em>general argument</em> that the clause was unfair
                    because it restrained the employee. The following passage from <em>Hairman</em> at [128]–[129] is, however, worth
                    noting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128 While it was complained that the result was that the scheme acted as a
                        restraint on employees leaving the respondent's employ, the fact is that
                        restraints are commonplace in employment and other kinds of relationships.
                        Remuneration itself is often structured so as to include attraction and
                        retention payments, as well as payment for the actual work performed. Other
                        conditions also often contain such elements. The decision of the Full Court
                        in <em>Westfield Limited &amp; Anor v Helprin</em>
                        (unreported; Cahill VP, Hungerford and Schmidt JJ; 23 March 1997) was
                        an example of such an approach, in that case adopted in connection with an
                        option scheme. Another common and even more direct approach to achieving
                        similar ends, is those agreements which provide for a fixed term contract of
                        employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">129 Designing a remuneration package with retention of employees as one
                        aim is not inherently unfair, indeed it is commonplace and to the advantage
                        of many employees, who thereby gain access to advantageous conditions,
                        otherwise not available to them. An inducement provided by an employment
                        contract to remain in employment for a time, does not preclude an employee
                        resigning, if he or she wishes. As in this case, the loss of such an
                        inducement can even enable an employee headhunted by another employer, to
                        negotiate more favourable terms in the new employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the second Australian authority cited by
                    Ms Hing, however, it is clear that the New South Wales Industrial Relations
                    Commission was concerned with an argument that the clause in question was a
                    restraint <em>of trade</em>, albeit that the argument was,
                    again, made in the context of an application for relief under s 106 of the
                    NSW Act on the ground that the relevant contract of employment was unfair. In
                        <em>Rick Lloyd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia
                        Ltd</em> [2006] NSWIRComm 129 (“<em>Lloyd</em>”), the commission was faced with the forfeiture of
                    a deferred bonus upon the employee’s resignation from employment. One of
                    the arguments raised by the employee was that the forfeiture was in restraint of
                    trade (see <em>Lloyd</em> at [56]). In rejecting the reliance on the restraint of trade
                    doctrine, the court attached significance to the fact that the employee was paid
                    a substantial portion of his performance based bonus upon completion of the
                    review and that he was fully aware of the financial consequences to the deferred
                    bonus upon resignation. The commission therefore arrived at the conclusion that
                    such an arrangement did not have a coercive effect or fetter on the
                    employee’s ability to find alternative work in the same industry (see
                        <em>Lloyd</em> at [101]–[103]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">101    In the present circumstances the actual clause the
                            subject of the allegation of restraint concerns the conditions of the
                            bonus scheme imported into the contracts of employment or arrangement
                            dealing with the payment of deferred performance-based bonuses, namely
                            continued satisfactory performance and continued employment. Whether
                            that clause constituted a restraint falls to be decided by reference to
                            the particular circumstances applicable to both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102    These circumstances reveal that the applicant was
                            not precluded from seeking employment with ABN Amro. There was no
                            evidence led during the course of proceedings which might suggest that
                            the position at ABN Amro did not entail skills and responsibility
                            commensurate with the applicant's position at the respondent bank. The
                            new position also paid a comparable salary. <em>The
                                applicant was aware at all times of the likely consequences of
                                resignation</em>. It was commonplace for an employee to
                            forfeit unvested components of a bonus in the event of resignation as
                            attested to by Mr McAuley in his affidavit. The respondent's
                            retention policy was, and is, also commonplace within the banking and
                            finance industry and known and understood as such by the applicant.
                            Notwithstanding that a significant proportion of the applicant's
                            performance-based bonuses stood to be forfeited in the event of
                            resignation the applicant was remunerated by means of his fixed salary.
                            In addition the applicant consistently received in excess of half of his
                            performance based bonuses immediately upon completion of his yearly
                            performance reviews. This factor alone substantially mitigates the
                            impact of any binding or coercive effect that the conditions attaching
                            to the payment of the deferred bonuses may have otherwise had on the
                            applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103    Based on the circumstances applicable to the
                            applicant's situation I have some doubt that the offending clause as
                            characterised constituted a restraint of trade. <em>It is
                                difficult to see how, in all the circumstances the clause had a
                                coercive effect on the applicant or acted as a fetter on his ability
                                to seek and obtain other employment within the same
                                industry</em>. Even if it were to be construed as a restraint
                            of trade I would nevertheless find, based on the same circumstances as
                            outlined above, that the clause was reasonable: see <em>Prudential Assurance Co v Rodrigues</em> at 57.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It is apparent that in order for an employee
                    to receive and retain a bonus under a Payment-for-Loyalty Clause, the employee
                    would not be able to work for anyone else and that must necessarily include a
                    competitor. In that sense as argued by Ms Hing, Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses
                    have a more overreaching effect than Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses. Viewed
                    in this context, it can be said that <em>in substance</em>,
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses are similar to Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses.
                    The reason why Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses are not construed as in restraint of
                    trade is simply because they do not <em>in substance</em>
                    deprive the employee of his right to work for a competitor. All it does is to
                    provide a financial disincentive to an employee if he chooses to breach the
                    condition in the Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses. As there is <em>in
                        substance</em> no difference between the two types of clauses, in my
                    view, there can be no rational justification to treat Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses any differently from Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In arriving at my decision, I did consider the
                    point that Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses appear to be targeted at the
                    employee joining a competitor whereas Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses appear to
                    promote the employee’s loyalty and retention as its main objective.
                    However in my view, it would be naive to believe that Payment-for-Loyalty
                    Clauses are not directed to prevent employees from joining competitors. After
                    all, the principal purpose in promoting retention and loyalty is to ensure that
                    the employees do not join the competitor by remaining in its
                employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In response to the cases considering
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses, Mr Jeyaretnam SC made three submissions.
                    First, they do not appear to have been “rigorously challenged”.
                    That is a matter of opinion. Admittedly, the decisions on Payment-for-Loyalty
                    Clauses that Ms Hing referred me to were not decisions of apex courts. One
                    thing is however clear. At least the validity of Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses was
                    tested against the restraint of trade doctrine. However in the case of
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses, the decisions upholding the validity of
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses do not appear to have been considered or even cited.
                    Secondly, the time between the declaration of bonus and the payment in cases
                    involving Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses is typically short. This point is neither
                    here nor there. It would be relevant in the inquiry as to its reasonableness
                    after it has been determined to be in restraint of trade. Thirdly,
                    Forfeiture-for-Competition Clauses are even worse than Payment-for-Loyalty
                    Clauses in that “if the employee remains employed, with his bonus
                    deferred, at least he continues to be economically productive.” I do not
                    quite understand this argument. An employee who is subjected to a
                    Payment-for-Loyalty Clause can also be economically productive if he remains
                    employed except that he or she would forfeit the deferred bonus upon resignation
                    unlike the case under a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause. However it cannot be
                    seriously contended that a Forfeiture-for-Competition Clause is more restrictive
                    than a Payment-for-Loyalty Clause. A Payment-for-Loyalty Clause provides for
                    forfeiture regardless of whether the employee competes. In any case, the issue
                    is not which of the two clauses is worse or better than the other but whether
                    the public policy considerations relating to the restraint of trade doctrine are
                    engaged in either Payment-for-Loyalty Clauses or Forfeiture-for-Competition
                    Clauses. I have found that it did not apply to either of the
                clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the light of my decision that the
                    Forfeiture Provision was not in restraint of trade, it would follow from
                    Mr Jeyaretnam SC’s concession that OS 103/2011 should be dismissed in
                    its entirety. As such there is strictly no necessity for me to consider the
                    remaining issues on the reasonableness of the Forfeiture Provision or whether
                    the Deferred Incentive Payments were supported by any consideration independent
                    of the alleged restraint of trade. However since full submissions were made by
                    both parties, I shall express my views on these two issues in case I am wrong on
                    the main issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the Forfeiture Provision reasonable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is well established that in determining
                    whether the clause in restraint of trade is reasonable, the clause must be shown
                    to be reasonable in the interests of the parties <em>and</em> in the interests of the public (see <em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [70] citing
                    the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Thorsten Nordenfelt v
                        The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, Limited</em>
                    [1894] AC 535 at 565). In applying this principle, the court will have
                    regard to, in particular, the geographical scope or area of the restraint and
                    the duration of the restraint (see <em>Man Financial</em>
                    at [73]). Furthermore, the employer must
                    have a <em>legitimate proprietary interest</em> that it
                    seeks to protect by having a restraint of trade (see <em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [79]). There
                    are two interests that may legitimately be protected in an employment context,
                        <em>viz</em>, trade secrets and trade connections (see
                        <em>Man Financial</em> at [81] citing an earlier edition of <em>Butterworths</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It was common ground between the parties that
                    the defendant bore the burden to prove that the Forfeiture Provision was
                    reasonable in the event that it was found to be in restraint of
                trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Had I determined the Forfeiture Provision to
                    be, in substance, in restraint of trade, I would have found it to be
                    unreasonable and hence unenforceable. As Mr Jeyaretnam SC has accepted that
                    the defendant’s TSF business is non-generic, <em>ie</em>, proprietary and involved financial institutions and trading
                    partners all over the world, it cannot be disputed that the defendant has a
                    legitimate proprietary interest to protect. I do not, however, think that the
                    extent of the restraint is reasonable for the following reasons. First, the
                    Forfeiture Provision is wider than necessary in terms of duration. The
                    Non-Compete Agreement restrains trade for only one year while the Forfeiture
                    Provision covers a period of two years. There is no compelling reason why the
                    defendant’s legitimate proprietary interest requires protection beyond the
                    period for which it already receives protection under the Non-Compete Agreement.
                    Secondly, the Forfeiture Provision has no geographical limit whereas the
                    restriction under the Non-Compete Agreement is limited to countries in which the
                    defendant has an actual place of business. Finally, the Forfeiture Provision
                    covers employment by and consulting with any organisation which competes for
                    employees, customers, clients, market share or financial/commodity resources and
                    deals. It is therefore not limited to the TSF business and hence is wider than
                    necessary to safeguard the defendant’s legitimate proprietary
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I was therefore not persuaded by the
                    defendant’s submissions that the two-year restriction under the Forfeiture
                    Provision ought to be upheld. Ms Hing emphasised that it did not prohibit
                    the plaintiff from competing and that it was not imposed as a condition for
                    employment. Accordingly, the plaintiff had “full bargaining power”
                    and consequently had a choice. These were effectively the same arguments that
                    were made to displace the application of the restraint of trade doctrine to the
                    Forfeiture Provision. It did not address the issue why it was wider than
                    necessary to protect the defendant’s TSF business and in particular why
                    the period of restriction was longer than that provided under the Non-Compete
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the present case, had I found to the
                    contrary that the Forfeiture Provision was in restraint of trade, I would have
                    severed it from the Incentive Award Plan without the need to invoke the
                    “blue-pencil test” as it was a standalone clause which did not
                    affect the other provisions. Would its severance render the Incentive Award Plan
                    unenforceable for lack of consideration? I determined it to the negative as
                    explained below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the Deferred Incentive Payments supported by any
                consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendant relies on <em>Wyatt</em>, <em>Pitney-Bowes</em>, <em>Sadler</em> and <em>Marshall</em> for
                    the proposition that a promise to provide a benefit made conditional on the
                    observance of a restraint of trade will not be enforceable if the restraint is
                    found to be invalid provided that the <em>only</em>
                    consideration for the promise was the restraint of trade.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     On the facts, the defendant submits that it
                    promised to pay the Deferred Incentive Payments only in consideration for the
                    plaintiff’s observance of the condition that he did not compete for the
                    stipulated period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    argues that the Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs <em>only</em>
                    governed the payment of the Deferred Incentive Payments and <em>not</em> the Cash Payments. This is evidenced by the fact that the
                    Cash Payments were always paid <em>before</em> the
                    plaintiff signed the Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In response, the plaintiff argues that the
                    main consideration for the payments under the Incentive Award Plan was his hard
                    work and good performance and not the condition in the Forfeiture Provision that
                    he was not to compete. The Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs provide that the awards
                    are “discretionary based on individual, team and business
                        results”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also
                    points out that the Incentive Award Plan also comprised Cash Payments which were
                    paid regardless of non-competition. The consideration for the Cash Payments
                    cannot be different from the consideration for the Deferred Incentive Payments
                    since they are both part of the same plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The parties are in agreement that a promise to
                    provide a benefit is unenforceable if its only consideration is an invalid
                    restraint of trade. The proposition is well established and was in fact restated
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Man Financial</em> as part of
                    its description of the doctrine of severance (<em>Man
                        Financial</em> at [126] and [128]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    As this particular
                            doctrine [<em>ie</em>, severance] did not really
                            arise in the present appeal (although it did in the court below), we
                            will not dwell upon it at any length. (We pause to observe,
                            parenthetically, however, that the doctrine of severance might
                            nevertheless be of some relevance in the context of Clause C.1.) In
                            brief, at the level of general principle, there are two objectives
                            underlying the doctrine of severance, which were neatly encapsulated by
                            Chao Hick Tin JA (as he then was) in <em>National
                                Aerated Water Co</em> ([58] <em>supra</em>), as follows (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The doctrine of severance may be invoked to serve two purposes. The
                            first is to cut out altogether an objectionable promise from a contract
                            leaving the rest of the contract valid and enforceable. [The] [s]econd
                            is to cut down an objectionable promise as to its scope but not to cut
                            it out of the contract altogether. An unreasonably wide restraint of
                            trade clause would be a classical example of a case falling within the
                            second category.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128    The former category referred to in the above
                            quotation (at [126]) deals, in contrast, with severance of <b><em>entire or whole clauses</em></b> in a contract. As was
                            noted in the court below, the basic test centres on whether the
                            objectionable promise (as embodied, ex hypothesi, within the clause in
                            question itself) is <b><em>substantially the whole or the
                                main consideration for the promise sought to be enforced</em></b>.
                            If it is the whole or the main consideration, then the doctrine of
                            severance will not apply; if not, the doctrine will apply. Everything
                            depends, of course, on the precise factual matrix before the court (in
                            this regard, see, for example, the oft-cited (and contrasting) English
                            decisions of <em>Goodinson v
                            Goodinson</em> [1954] 2 QB 118 on the one hand and
                                <em>Bennett v Bennett</em> [1952]
                            1 KB 249 on the other). In the present case, the Judge
                                held, <em>inter alia</em>, that Clause C.1
                            and Clause C.3 did not constitute all, or substantially all, the
                            consideration for the Compensation to be paid under the Termination
                            Agreement (see GD ([1] <em>supra</em>) at
                            [216]-[218]). In view of our characterisation of Clause C.1 (at [188]
                            below) as a <em>condition</em>, we would, as
                            mentioned earlier at [16], with respect, disagree with the Judge.
                            Briefly put, we find that cll C.1-C.3 of the Termination Agreement were
                            intended by the parties to constitute the main consideration for the
                            Compensation to be paid under that agreement (see, generally, the
                            analysis below at [182]-[187]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The question therefore is whether the
                    Forfeiture Provision formed substantially the whole or the main consideration
                    for the Deferred Incentive Payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In my view, the Forfeiture Provision is not
                    the whole or the main consideration for the Deferred Incentive Payments. As the
                    plaintiff argues, the Incentive Award Plan T&amp;Cs state that the incentive
                    payments are “based on individual, team and business unit
                    results”. Given that this is the express basis for the whole Incentive
                    Award Plan, it may be deduced that a substantial part of the consideration for
                    incentive payments is the performance of the individual employee, his team and
                    his business unit. The Forfeiture Provision may have formed a part of the
                    consideration for the Deferred Incentive Payments but it certainly cannot be
                    said to be substantially the whole or the main consideration given the basis of
                    the Incentive Award Plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     This has been a very challenging decision for
                    me to reach. In the process, I was greatly assisted by the well-researched and
                    focussed submissions by both Mr Jeyaretnam SC and Ms Hing to whom I
                    would like to express my gratitude. I am sure this is not the last word on this
                    important issue of employment law and no doubt the employment market would
                    welcome a definitive decision by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the result, OS 103/2011 is dismissed with
                    costs and such costs shall include the costs for the conversion application
                    since that application would have been allowed if not for the sensible
                    concessions made by Mr Jeyaretnam SC in order for me to hear and
                    dispose of OS 103/2011. I fix the costs at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements to
                    be paid forthwith by the plaintiff to the defendant.</p>
