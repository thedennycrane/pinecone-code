</div>  The terms of the RSU Plan also suggest that it is premised on the first defendant being a publicly listed company.  For instance, one of the defined terms at Art 1.1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) of the RSU Plan is “Exchange”, which is defined as the TSX, TSX-V or any other stock exchange on which the first defendant’s shares are listed for trading.  Under Art 4.3, one of the two ways by which the first defendant may provide its shares to the RSU Plan’s participants pursuant to vested RSUs was to purchase those shares on the TSX-V or any other Exchange (as defined).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>On 21 September 2018, Mr Finck was granted a “one-off gift” of an award of 38,260 RSUs which would entitle him to shares in the first defendant.  A letter dated 21 September 2018, which informed Mr Finck of the award, valued those RSUs as CAD 122,433 worth of shares as at that date based on then “open market trading prices”.

Attached to the letter was a document titled “Schedule A - Form of Restricted Share Unit Agreement” (the “RSU Agreement Form”), which sets out the terms and conditions on which RSUs were awarded by the first defendant and the schedule over which such awarded RSUs were to vest.

While SAIS was obliged to provide Mr Hardman 72,590 RSUs and the corresponding shares, that was pursuant to the RSU Agreement Form which Mr Hardman executed on 9 December 2019 (see [29] above), and not because SAIS was a party to the Bonus Agreement.  Under the Bonus Agreement, it was Kaddra’s obligation alone to procure that SAIS provided Mr Hardman with those shares by the end of February 2020.  That is also consistent with how the 17 Jun 2020 Letter by Mr Hardman’s counsel had been addressed to Kaddra rather than SAIS (see [33] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>Mr Finck claims that he never received the 12,753 shares which SAIS was to provide him, pursuant to the Redundancy Agreement reached between him and Kaddra on 6 September 2019, when his employment was terminated.

</div>  In any case, the defendants do not agree that the plaintiffs are entitled to be provided with their shares on either 13 September 2019 or 15 October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>In respect of Mr Hardman’s claim to his awarded RSUs that remained outstanding (“the Outstanding RSUs”), the defendants’ pleaded defence differs from the position that they take in their closing submissions.  The Outstanding RSUs, totalling 133,079 RSUs, comprise the total number of RSUs which Mr Hardman was contractually entitled to under the RSU Agreement Form executed on 29 March 2019 (199,619 RSUs) and which were to vest over three tranches (see [13] above) minus the first one-third of Mr Hardman’s awarded RSUs (66,540 RSUs) which had vested on 21 August 2019 and pursuant to which shares were issued to Mr Hardman on 4 October 2019 (see [28] above).   In their D&amp;CC, the defendants’ position is that Mr Hardman’s awarded RSUs were to vest according to the terms of the vesting schedule as set out in the RSU Agreement Form executed on 29 March 2019 by Mr Hardman.

</div>  This meant that the Outstanding RSUs were not scheduled to vest until August 2020, at the earliest.  On 13 August 2020, SAIS “caused [the Outstanding RSUs] to be issued and vested” to Mr Hardman, and the corresponding shares were subsequently issued to Mr Hardman on 21 September 2020. Therefore, the defendants say, Mr Hardman’s claim for any SAIS shares pursuant to the Outstanding RSUs is extinguished.

</div>  Evidently, the import of the defendants’ pleaded defence is that any Change of Control event has no effect whatsoever on the awarded RSUs’ original vesting schedule.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>In their closing submissions, however, the defendants take a different position.

Therefore, even if the Outstanding RSUs vested on the date of the Change of Control event, the defendants say they have until 31 December 2022 to issue Mr Hardman SAIS shares pursuant to the Outstanding RSUs.

He also allegedly gave a false impression to the defendants that Mr Finck would not subsequently commence legal proceedings against them if the clause providing for the vesting of the first one-third of Mr Finck’s RSUs was included in the Redundancy Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>The thrust of Mr Chiarugi’s evidence is that, even if the completion of the Wine Business Sale disposed of substantial assets of the first defendant, it nevertheless still had other assets associated with KADDRA, and so the Wine Business Sale did not constitute a sale of “all or substantially all of the assets” of the first defendant within the meaning of Art 1.1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)(ii) of the RSU Plan.  Given the public statements of the first defendant in relation to the transaction, I find that the evidential burden was on the defendants to show that the value of the assets which remained with the first defendant <span class="font-italic">after </span>the Wine Business Sale were such that the sale of its wine and spirits business (which was undisputedly a substantial<span class="font-italic"> </span>asset) nevertheless did not constitute a sale of “all or substantially all of the assets” of the first defendant.  However, in these proceedings, the defendants have not provided any evidence on the assets that remained with the first defendant after the Wine Business Sale and what their actual financial worth might have been.  More specifically, there was no evidence as to the actual financial worth of the assets associated with KADDRA (such as its intellectual property, goodwill or any value associated with the CEM online platform).  In any case, I find that the commercial value associated with KADDRA’s assets at that time could not have been significant relative to the value of the wine and spirits distribution business given that the development of KADDRA was in its infancy and its prospects remained uncertain.  That was the very reason it had been pointed out in the Information Circular that there can be “no assurance” that the first defendant’s operations, which would have involved <span class="font-italic">only</span> KADDRA and its related services following the Wine Business Sale, “will be profitable in the future or will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its working capital requirements”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>I therefore find that the Wine Business Sale was a sale of “all or substantially all of the assets” of SAIS within the meaning of Art 1.1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)(ii) of the RSU Plan.  I am also reinforced in this conclusion by two further points.  First, it is not in dispute (as the terms of the Information Circular which I referred to earlier at [61] make clear) that following the Wine Business Sale, KADDRA was the only remaining potential revenue-generating business of SAIS.  The wines and spirits distribution business had accounted for 95.7% of SAIS’s revenue for the period that ended in March 2019.  Therefore, from a commercial and business risk perspective, it is difficult to regard the Wine Business Sale, which removed from SAIS its <span class="font-italic">only</span> reliable revenue-generating business that had accounted for almost the <span class="font-italic">entirety</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of its revenue, as anything but a sale of “all or substantially all of the assets” of SAIS.  Second, and as the plaintiffs pointed out, there was also an 86% difference in the book value of the assets of SAIS and its subsidiaries before and after the closing of the Wine Business Sale on 13 September 2019 - the unaudited consolidated financial statements of SAIS for the period ending 30 September 2019 record that the total asset value of SAIS and its subsidiaries was US$13.071m as at 31 December 2018, and US$1.866m as at 30 September 2019.

In Ms Bong’s email to him on 13 February 2020, she set out, amongst other things, a summary of the position in relation to his awarded RSUs and stated “2/3 has vested due to change of control with Wine sale”.

In their closing submissions, the defendants argue that, while the Change of Control might cause the awarded RSUs to vest immediately on the date of the event, they still retain the option under Art 4.3 of “settling” the vested RSUs by either purchasing shares in the open market or by issuing Treasury Shares <span class="font-italic">by the end of the third year following the year of the grant of the RSUs</span>.  I note that this was a departure from their pleaded defence, which was that Mr Hardman’s awarded RSUs vested according to the scheduled vesting dates (see [13] above), and so the Outstanding RSUs did not vest until sometime in August 2020, even if the Change of Control event took place in September or October 2019 (see [43] above).

</div>  The plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that Art 5.3 is a specific provision that must take precedence over the general position set out in Art 4.3, and that the shares due to them pursuant to any awarded but unvested RSUs must be provided at the time of the occurrence of the Change of Control event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>In my judgment, the defendants’ position in their pleaded defence is an entirely untenable one to take.  It is clear from a plain reading of Art 5.3 (as set out at [37] above) that it governs what must happen when a Change of Control event occurs.  In such a situation, as Art 5.3 provides, “<span class="font-italic">all</span> RSUs shall be deemed to have <span class="font-italic">vested </span><span class="font-italic">immediately prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control</span>” [emphasis added].  As such, all the awarded but unvested RSUs of Mr Hardman must be taken to have vested immediately prior to 13 September 2019, which I have found is the date of the Change of Control event (see [67] above).  This is regardless of the scheduled vesting dates set out in the RSU Agreement Form executed by Mr Hardman on 29 March 2019.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Article 5.3 goes on to provide that the deemed vested RSUs “shall become <span class="font-italic">payable effective immediately</span> on such date” [emphasis added].  The date referred to is the one on which the Change of Control event has occurred.  In my view, this makes it crystal clear that the defendants do not have any option (which they otherwise had under Art 4.3) to defer the actual purchasing of shares for, or issuing of shares to, Mr Hardman.  The defendants must do so <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> on the occurrence of the Change of Control event.  It did not suffice for the defendants to issue SAIS shares to Mr Hardman pursuant to the Outstanding RSUs only on 21 September 2020, more than a year after the Change of Control event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>To underline the point that SAIS must take immediate steps to ensure that the SAIS Group’s employees’ awarded RSUs and the corresponding shares are made available to the employee upon the Change of Control event, Art 5.3 actually goes further to provide that, to the extent that SAIS is involved in a transaction where the occurrence of the Change of Control is dependent on actions to be taken by SAIS, the company must ensure that all entitlements relating to those RSUs deemed vested by Art 5.3 are paid to the RSU Plan’s participants <span class="font-italic">concurrently with and as</span> <span class="font-italic">a condition </span><span class="font-italic">precedent of any such transaction</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>The defendants’ case, as set out in their closing submissions, that they had, pursuant to Arts 4.3 and 4.6 of the RSU Plan, up to three years from the date of the grant to “settle” RSUs notwithstanding the occurrence of the Change of Control event (see [46] above), does not accord with a proper interpretation of the RSU Plan.  I will explain how I came to this view shortly, but let me say something first about the defendants’ own evidence on this issue of when the awarded RSUs vested and when the corresponding SAIS shares were to be provided to the participants of the RSU Plan.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>From my review of the evidence that emerged under the cross-examination of their witnesses, I find the conduct of the defendants at the material time to be quite inconsistent with the various positions that they have put forward in these proceedings.  I have already referred to the internal position taken by the senior management where Mr Gouw had advised Mr Chiarugi that the awarded RSUs would vest upon the close of the Wine Business Sale (see [65] above).  I have also referred to the email sent by Ms Bong to Mr Hardman, copied to Mr Gouw, in February 2020, where Mr Hardman was informed that two-thirds of his RSUs (corresponding to the Outstanding RSUs) had vested upon the close of the “Wine sale” (see [66] above).  The fact that the defendants saw these RSUs as vesting on the closing of the Wine Business Sale, and not pursuant to the vesting schedule that had been set out in the respective RSU Agreement Forms signed by the SAIS Group’s employees (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, [10] and [13] above), contradicted their pleaded defence (see [43] above) and showed their recognition that Art 5.3 was the operative provision <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> these employees’ entitlement to their outstanding RSUs once the Wine Business Sale was completed.  As will be explained further (see [78]-[86] below), the defendants were also operating under the assumption that, upon vesting, SAIS had an obligation to issue the corresponding shares to Mr Hardman.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>The oral evidence of the defendants’ witnesses showed up the irreconcilable inconsistencies in their case.  Mr Chiarugi gave evidence that he knew that the awarded but unvested RSUs of the employees would immediately vest and become payable the moment the Change of Control event took place.

</div>  In their closing submissions, the defendants take up this new but unpleaded point raised by Mr Gouw and say that SAIS had up to three years from the date of the grant to ensure that these vested RSUs were “settled” or “paid” (see [44]-[46] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>I reject this interpretation of the RSU Plan.  It is plainly inconsistent with the unambiguous terms of Art 5.3, which uses the word “immediately” twice, in terms of both vesting <span class="font-italic">and</span> payment (see [69]-[70] above).  The use of the term “settling” is found in Art 4.3, and it is used in the context of SAIS having a choice of purchasing shares in the open market or issuing Treasury shares to “settle” its obligation of providing shares to the RSU Plan’s participants pursuant to their vested RSUs.  The use of the term “settle” is no more than a description of the manner in which SAIS can fulfil its obligation to provide shares to the RSU Plan’s participants.  It does not tell us about <span class="font-italic">when</span> SAIS is required to fulfil this obligation.  The timeline for the fulfilment of this obligation is instead set out by the remaining terms of Art 4.3 (apart from “settling”) itself.  That timeline, however, can have no effect on the first defendant’s obligations under Art 5.3.  I have already rejected the contention that the timeline in Art 4.3 applies to a situation involving a Change of Control event contemplated in Art 5.3 (see [69]-[70] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>The use of the word “payable” in Art 5.3, in my view, simply refers to the act of providing SAIS shares to the RSU Plan’s participants.  That this is the proper interpretation is borne out by the use of “payable” in a similar fashion in Art 4.6.  In the context of Art 5.3, that is expressed as something that must be done “immediately” upon the occurrence of the Change of Control event (see [70] above).  As such, there is really no basis for Mr Gouw to draw a distinction between the time of vesting of the awarded RSUs and their “payment” which he says will come much later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span><span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>In fact, it became quite apparent from the evidence of both Mr Chiarugi and Mr Gouw as to what had been operating on their minds when they delayed the issuance of shares to Mr Hardman, instead of immediately doing so on the closing of the Wine Business Sale, which they knew they were required to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>Under cross-examination, Mr Chiarugi explained that, while he was aware all the unvested RSUs would vest upon a Change of Control and that SAIS should provide the shares to the RSU Plan’s participants immediately,

So, the reference to an AGM held on 29 July 2019 in Mr Chiarugi’s and Mr Gouw’s affidavits of evidence-in-chief might have been an error.  In any event, in his oral evidence, Mr Gouw explained that the mandate given to the board of SAIS for the issuance of new shares pursuant to vested RSUs had to be renewed every year, but the lawyers which were advising SAIS on the restructuring of the group did not realise this.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span> I make several observations about the defendants’ explanations for their failure to provide the SAIS shares to Mr Hardman on 13 September 2019, as they were otherwise required by Art 5.3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>First, even if I accept the defendants’ explanation about the need to renew the shareholders’ mandate to the board for the issuance of new shares, it is unclear to me whether this is the reason they had been unable to issue shares to Mr Hardman pursuant to their obligations under Art 5.3.  Insufficient documentary evidence has been placed before the court as to the content of this mandate and when exactly it expired, as to show that it was the failure to renew this mandate at the supposed 29 July 2019 AGM that had been responsible for the defendants’ subsequent omission to issue Mr Hardman’s shares.  Also, there has not been a satisfactory explanation as to how, in spite of the alleged lack of mandate (which was only later obtained at the EGM in November 2019), SAIS was somehow able to issue Mr Hardman 66,540 SAIS shares on 4 October 2019, which corresponds to the first one-third of Mr Hardman’s awarded RSUs that vested on 21 August 2019 (see [28] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>Second, the defendants have not pleaded any defence in law that arises out of these facts and circumstances concerning the lack of a shareholders’ mandate, or the inability to issue new shares because of the delisting of SAIS from the TSX-V and the subsequent migration of its shares to Singapore.  Thus, strictly speaking, these facts and circumstances are not relevant matters that the court should consider in deciding whether the defendants have a good defence to Mr Hardman’s claim that there had been a breach of contract because of SAIS’s failure to provide him with the requisite number of SAIS shares that he became entitled to on the date of the Change of Control, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>Third, it is quite apparent that the defendants had failed to take the required steps<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>to ensure that SAIS was able to comply with its obligations under Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan to provide Mr Hardman with SAIS shares pursuant to his vested RSUs on 13 September 2019.  Even if the court is prepared to accept that the defendants’ omission was the result of the lack of a share mandate, that is not a defence to Mr Hardman’s claim for breach of contract.  A contractual obligation must be complied with strictly (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Edwin Peel, <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">reitel on The Law of Contract </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Treitel</span>”) at para 17-065).  It is generally immaterial why a defendant has failed to fulfil his contractual obligations in a claim for breach of contract, and it is no defence to plead that he has done his best (see <span class="font-italic">Raineri v Miles </span>[1981] AC 1050 at 1086).  A supervening event can only provide a party with an excuse for non-performance if it occurs without the fault of the party relying on it (<span class="font-italic">Treitel </span>at para 17-070).  The failure to comply with a contractual obligation because of negligence, lack of attention, or because of poor advice obtained from professional advisers, cannot constitute any legal justification that excuses compliance by the obligor.  Therefore, if indeed it is the case that SAIS could not comply with Art 5.3 by issuing shares to Mr Hardman on 13 September 2019 because of a lack of a mandate to issue new shares, that cannot serve as any defence in law because this unfortunate situation was a consequence of its own negligence and/or poor advice obtained from its professional advisers.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>As such, I find that SAIS has breached Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan by failing to provide Mr Hardman 133,079 SAIS shares, which corresponds to the shares which ought to have been provided to him pursuant to the Outstanding RSUs, on 13 September 2019 as required by that clause.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>In this regard, it must be recalled that 66,540 shares were issued to Mr Hardman on 4 October 2019 (see [28] above).  That was pursuant to the first one-third of his awarded RSUs, which had vested on 21 August 2019, as <span class="font-italic">per</span> the scheduled vesting date in the RSU Agreement Form executed by Mr Hardman on 29 March 2019 (see [13] above).  Despite the late provision of these shares, counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed to the court that Mr Hardman was not making any claim for breach of contract in respect of these 66,540 shares given to him on 4 October 2019, instead of on 13 September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Finck’s RSUs granted in February 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>In the case of Mr Finck, the difference in his situation in so far as his awarded RSUs are concerned is that his employment at Kaddra was terminated on 6 September 2019.  The defendants submit that this meant that Mr Finck had no legal entitlement to the RSUs awarded to him because the first one-third of his awarded RSUs was only due to vest on 21 September 2019.  The defendants rely on Art 5.1 of the RSU Plan, which provide that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">any [RSUs] granted to [the RSU Plan participant] which have not become Vested [RSUs] prior to [the date of the termination of his employment] shall automatically and immediately terminate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>However, it is clear from the plain wording of Art 5.1 that the automatic termination of Mr Finck’s entitlement to his RSUs is subject to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, Art 5.3.  The opening words of Art 5.1, which precede the portion quoted above, provide as follows: “[n]otwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 and <span class="font-italic">subject to the remaining provisions of this Article 5</span> and to any express resolution by the Board …” [emphasis added].  Thus, if Art 5.3 is applicable to Mr Finck, then his entitlement to awarded RSUs would not automatically terminate upon the termination of his employment on 6 September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>The chronology of events is significant.  As already recounted, in May 2019, SAIS announced that it was exploring the possibility of entering into a transaction for the sale of its wine and spirits distribution business (see [20] above).  On 29 July 2019, SAIS entered into the SPA in relation to Sarment Wines, pursuant to which the Wine Business Sale would be effected (see [21] above).  This sale was subject to certain conditions.  On 30 August 2019, one of the key conditions – that of shareholder approval – was fulfilled.  Before the sale was completed on 13 September 2019, which was when the other conditions of the Wine Business Sale were fulfilled (see [58] above), Mr Finck’s employment was terminated (on 6 September 2019).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>The definition of a Change of Control in Art 1.1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)(ii) (as set out at [38] above) refers to a sale of SAIS’s assets in “a single transaction or a series of related transactions”.   In my view, the Wine Business Sale was effected through a series of related transactions, as is clear from the terms of the SPA between SAIS and the Buyers.  Also, in connection with the Wine Business Sale, the Buyers had to enter into agreements <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> for Mr Irwin to acquire their shareholdings in SAIS.  I find that the series of “transactions” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Art 1.1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)(ii)) started on 29 July 2019 with the entering into of the SPA between SAIS and the Buyers, and these series of transactions culminated in the Wine Business Sale being completed on 13 September 2019, which I have already found to be the date when the Change of Control event occurred (see [67] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>Mr Finck was still an employee of Kaddra and the SAIS Group when the first of the series of transactions was entered into (namely, SAIS’s entry into the SPA on 29 July 2019), and in my judgment, Art 5.3 was already engaged then.  Art 5.3 draws a distinction between when SAIS’s obligation to ensure immediate vesting and payment of RSUs is <span class="font-italic">engaged</span> and when that obligation falls due for <span class="font-italic">performance</span>.  The opening words of Art 5.3 (“[i]n the <span class="font-italic">event</span> of a Change of Control”), read together with the definition of a “Change of Control” in Art. 1.1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)(ii) (which contemplates a sale of SAIS’s assets giving rise to a Change of Control taking place in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) make it clear that, in cases where the sale of SAIS’s assets occurs through a series of related transactions, SAIS’s obligation in Art 5.3<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>is engaged once the <span class="font-italic">first </span>transaction in the entire series occurs.  On the other hand, the part of Art 5.3 that follows (“all [RSUs] shall be deemed to have vested immediately prior to the <span class="font-italic">occurrence</span> of the Change of Control and shall become payable effectively immediately on such date”) shows that this obligation subsequently falls due for performance when the sale of the assets <span class="font-italic">occurs</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when it is completed.  Accordingly, the fact that the completion of the Wine Business Sale and hence the Change of Control event took place after Mr Finck’s employment was terminated does not take away his legal rights to his RSUs that had accrued conditionally from 29 July 2019 pursuant to Art 5.3.  Those rights became enforceable against SAIS on 13 September 2019 when the last condition precedent was met (namely, the approval from TSX-V for the Wine Business Sale).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>In his oral evidence, Mr Chiarugi agreed with counsel’s suggestion that the transaction involving the Wine Business Sale involved several steps, and all the steps were part of that transaction.

</div>  Mr Gouw therefore accepts that the transaction involving the Wine Business Sale had started <span class="font-italic">before</span> the termination of Mr Finck’s employment.  Thus, the evidence of the defendants is consistent with my finding that, whether one views the Wine Business Sale as comprising one transaction with many steps, or a series of related transactions, the process which led to the Change of Control event (the completion of the Wine Business Sale) started <span class="font-italic">before</span> Mr Finck’s employment was terminated.  In my view, it could not possibly have been the intention of SAIS and the RSU Plan’s participants that SAIS could unilaterally extinguish the participants’ legal rights to their awarded but unvested RSUs by simply terminating their employment before the Change of Control event happened.  If the SAIS Group’s employees had no certainty whatsoever over their RSU entitlements, that would be plainly inconsistent with the purposes which the RSU Plan intended to achieve (see [9] above). That would be a commercially absurd result which the parties could not have intended when SAIS granted the RSU awards to the SAIS Group’s employees who accepted them by executing their respective RSU Agreement Forms, like Mr Finck did (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Soup Restauran</span><span class="font-italic">t </span>([56] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>   Thus, I find that, even though Mr Finck’s employment was terminated before the Wine Business Sale was completed, his rights to his awarded but unvested RSUs remain governed by Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan.  That means that, on 13 September 2019, Mr Finck should have been provided with 38,260 shares in SAIS, pursuant to all his awarded RSUs which were deemed to vest immediately prior to the completion of the Wine Business Sale.  This is, of course, all subject to whether, on 6 September 2019, Mr Finck had compromised his rights to the remaining two-third of his awarded RSUs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 25,507 RSUs, and only agreed to accept one-third of his awarded RSUs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 12,753 RSUs to be vested on 21 September 2019, by virtue of entering into the Redundancy Agreement with Kaddra (see [27] above).  That is a point which I will deal with later in this judgment (see [111] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Hardman’s claim to the 2018 Bonus</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>Mr Hardman claims that, under the terms of his employment with Kaddra, he was entitled to receive his bonus in cash.  From my review of the terms set out in Mr Hardman’s employment contracts, first with SPL dated 28 August 2017 (see [12] above), and then later with Kaddra dated 11 July 2019 (see [16] above), it does appear that he should receive his bonus in cash.

</div>  The “annual base” is not specifically defined but appears to be based on Mr Hardman’s gross monthly salary, which is expressed in a cash amount, and multiplied by 12 months.  Thus, the fact that the bonus is expressed as up to 40% of a cash amount indicates that the bonus would also be paid in cash, and not in some other form.  That would accord with an interpretation that is consistent with the commercial context of this arrangement between Mr Hardman and Kaddra.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>Be that as it may, the evidence before me shows that, when the issue of the 2018 Bonus was finalised in October 2019, Mr Hardman had entered into the Bonus Agreement with Kaddra and agreed that he could be paid the 2018 Bonus in the form of RSUs (see [29] above).  This was because, at that time, Kaddra simply did not have enough available cash to pay Mr Hardman his bonus.  While Mr Chiarugi did agree under cross-examination that he had quantified Mr Hardman’s bonus with some cash value in mind, and thus the number of RSUs to be awarded must have been decided based on the prevailing market price of the SAIS shares in October 2019,

</div> this does not change the fact that Mr Hardman did agree with Kaddra that he would receive 72,590 RSUs as the 2018 Bonus, and not any cash amount.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>Following from the Bonus Agreement, on 9 December 2019, Mr Hardman was granted 72,590 RSUs.  He executed another RSU Agreement Form on 9 December 2019 for these 72,590 RSUs (see [29] above).  This agreement was with SAIS.  In the agreement, there is no vesting date for these RSUs.  However, the agreement did provide that “[t]he performance period for this grant of RSUs commence[d] on [9 December 2019] and ends at the close of business on 18 March 2020 …”.

</div>  This suggested to me that SAIS had up to 18 March 2020 to vest these RSUs and provide the corresponding shares to Mr Hardman.  There was some evidence to indicate that Mr Hardman was informed in December 2019 that he would be given these shares by the end of February 2020, to which he expressed no objections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>The issue of when Mr Hardman would get his 72,590 shares was put to rest in January 2020.  When Mr Hardman resigned from his position in January 2020, Kaddra agreed in writing that his 72,590 RSUs would “be issued and vesting [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] at end February 2020”.  This was set out in the Resignation Letter, which was executed by Mr Hardman on 29 January 2020 (see [30]-[31] above), and appeared to be part of the payments he would get upon resignation.  As the RSUs had already been granted on 9 December 2019 when Mr Hardman executed the RSU Agreement Form, it must mean that the word “issue” used in the Resignation Letter referred to the issuance of new shares in SAIS, and not the issuance of the RSUs.  In these circumstances, I find that Mr Hardman and Kaddra had agreed in January 2020 that he would be provided his 72,590 SAIS shares pursuant to those vested RSUs by the end of February 2020, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 February 2020.  In other words, the Bonus Agreement was varied by the parties, when Mr Hardman resigned, to include a date by which Mr Hardman would get his 72,590 SAIS shares.  In fact, I note from the evidence that it is common ground between Mr Hardman and the defendants that Mr Hardman was to be provided with those shares by the end of February 2020.

</div> and the corresponding shares were issued to Mr Hardman on 21 September 2020, which was the earliest time at which SAIS shares could have been issued to Mr Hardman (see [47] above).  Therefore, it is not in dispute that SAIS did not vest the 72,590 RSUs by the end of February 2020 or provide Mr Hardman with the corresponding shares.  Whether it is because of the lack of a shareholders’ mandate for the issuance of new shares (see [80] above) or that SAIS was not permitted by the TSX-V to issue new shares as plans were already afoot for SAIS to be delisted (see [81] above), it is quite clear to me that Kaddra was in breach of the Bonus Agreement by failing to ensure that Mr Hardman was provided with his 72,590 SAIS shares by the end of February 2020 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 February 2020).

</div>  That would be an unprincipled approach which ignores the fact that Mr Hardman had agreed to accept the 2018 Bonus in the form of 72,590 RSUs and to receive the corresponding shares by the end of February 2020.  By entering into the Bonus Agreement, Mr Hardman had thus agreed with Kaddra to vary the terms in his employment contract which otherwise governed the payment of his bonus.  In doing so, Mr Hardman took on the risks and benefits of accepting RSUs in lieu of cash.  Mr Hardman did not reserve his right to seek payment in cash of a specified amount, if he was not given his shares by the end of February 2020, by the inclusion of an appropriate term in the Resignation Letter, which set out the terms and conditions of his resignation from Kaddra (see [31] above).  Since there has been a variation, and no reservation of Mr Hardman’s rights to seek his bonus in any specified cash amount, there is no longer any legal basis for Mr Hardman to seek payment of the 2018 Bonus in cash, based on some date in October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">105 </span>The plaintiffs’ counsel submits that Mr Hardman is entitled to such a claim because Mr Hardman has accepted the Kaddra’s breach of the Bonus Agreement and so he is entitled to treat himself as discharged from that agreement.

That being the case, I find that SAIS’s issuance of the 205,669 shares to Mr Hardman did not amount to any part payment to Mr Hardman.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>In any event, the defendants have placed no evidence before me as to the value of these 205,669 SAIS shares as at 21 September 2020.  I appreciate that there would be some difficulty in determining the value of these shares as at that time, given that by 17 March 2020, SAIS was no longer a publicly listed company (see [32] above).  However, the onus is on the defendants to show that the issuance of these shares would reduce the amount of damages that they have to pay Mr Hardman, and their failure to adduce any evidence of the value of these shares meant that I had little option but to attribute a nil value to these shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">112 </span>I should add that the defendants have not taken the position that Mr Hardman is obliged to accept these shares as mitigation of his loss.  In any case, if any such position had been taken, it would not have been sustainable.  While an aggrieved party is under a “duty” to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his loss consequent on the breach of contract and cannot profit or behave unreasonably at the expense of the defaulting party, he is not required to do anything outside of what a reasonable and prudent man would have done in the ordinary course of his business if he had been in the aggrieved party’s shoes, for instance, by acting in a way that exposes himself to financial hazard (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Asia Star” </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1154<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24], [30] and [31]).  In this case, the 205,669 SAIS shares issued by SAIS on 21 September 2020 were shares in a private limited company, which value was uncertain and could not be readily realised given their lack of marketability.  The acceptance of the 205,669 SAIS shares would not be a reasonable mitigatory step for Mr Hardman to have taken because that would have required Mr Hardman to act against his own commercial interests and it is not something which a reasonable man in his shoes would have done. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Finck’s agreement with Kaddra on 6 September 2019 regarding his redundancy payments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">113 </span> The dispute regarding the Redundancy Agreement of 6 September 2019, which sets out Mr Finck’s redundancy payments, is whether it was a term of the agreement that he would be waiving his claims to the remaining two-thirds of his awarded RSUs in exchange for the payments to be made to him, including the vesting of the first one-third of his awarded RSUs on 21 September 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">114 </span>A review of the terms set out in the 6 Sep 2019 Letter (see [27] above) does not indicate that Mr Finck had given up his claims against SAIS for the remaining two-thirds of his awarded RSUs by agreeing to accept the payments set out in the letter.  One does not see the usual “wavier and release” clause seen in settlement agreements where the parties waive all their other claims against each other apart from what is set out in the agreement.  The evidence of Mr Finck, and that of the defendants, also do not support any conclusion that the two sides had come to a compromise or settlement of any dispute, and that in consideration of these payments to be made to Mr Finck, he would give up his claim against SAIS for the remainder of his awarded RSUs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">115 </span>Mr Finck’s evidence is that he was unhappy with the draft redundancy package that had been offered to him.  He was unhappy about the sudden termination of his employment, that it had come so close to when the first one-third of his awarded RSUs would vest (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 21 September 2019), and that Kaddra was intending to pay his outstanding bonus and salary by way of instalments (see [26] above).  He conveyed what he was unhappy about to Mr Hardman and Ms Bong, and he mentioned that he would be seeing a lawyer to seek advice on his rights.  Then, later that day, on 5 September 2019, Mr Finck was offered a revised redundancy package, which he accepted.  The terms of this package were set out in the 6 Sep 2019 Letter, nothing more and nothing less.  Mr Finck was of the view that he had reached an agreement with Kaddra as to what he would be paid as part of his redundancy, but there was no settlement reached where he gave up all his outstanding rights against the defendants (specifically, <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>SAIS in connection with the awarded but unvested RSUs).

Mr Hardman then passed all this information to Mr Chiarugi and Mr Gouw, including the fact that Mr Finck had said that he would see a lawyer for advice on his rights.

In fact, the evidence showed that Mr Hardman was simply acting as a conduit for demands and offers to be passed between the senior management and Mr Finck.  There is no evidence that he attempted to influence the terms of the Redundancy Agreement that was eventually offered to Mr Finck.  There is no evidence also that he was in a position of conflict and could not discharge his duties as an employee of the defendants properly and faithfully.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>I also do not accept the defendants’ speculative assertion that Mr Hardman knew of Mr Finck’s intentions to sue all along, and that he withheld this information from the defendants.  It is quite clear from Mr Finck’s evidence and his conduct that he never thought, at that time, about suing for the SAIS shares corresponding to the remaining two-thirds of his awarded RSUs which were not the subject of the Redundancy Agreement.  In fact, on 9 September 2019, Mr Finck wrote an email to Mr Gouw expressing his gratitude to the latter for the terms that had been agreed to in the Redundancy Agreement and apologised that he “had to threaten legal actions [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to get this done”.

To recap, there is a portion of Art 4.3 which provides that a RSU Plan participant “shall not transfer, sell or assign [any shares] received” until six months following the settlement of the vested RSUs (see [44] above).  Based on this “moratorium”, with respect to the RSUs granted to the plaintiffs prior to the Change of Control date of 13 September 2019, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs would not have been permitted to monetise the shares pursuant to the RSU grants, even if those shares had been given to them on the occurrence of the Change of Control event, by selling them in the open market until 13 March 2020.  In the same vein, Mr Hardman’s claim for the value of the 72,590 shares, representing the 2018 Bonus, should not be assessed by reference to the market value of the shares as at 29 February 2020, but on 29 August 2020, because of the “moratorium” in Art 4.3.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">132 </span>As will be recalled, SAIS was delisted from the TSX-V on 17 March 2020 and its last day of trading was on 16 March 2020 (see [32] above).  If the defendants were correct and the “moratorium” in Art 4.3 applied, the market value of those SAIS shares which the plaintiffs should have been provided with on 13 September 2019 would have to be assessed based on the closing price of SAIS shares on 13 March 2020, which was CAD 0.08.

On the other hand, there was no evidence before me as to what the value of Mr Hardman’s 72,590 SAIS shares provided in respect of the 2018 Bonus would have been on 29 August 2020.  I appreciate the difficulties Mr Hardman would face in proving the value which those shares would have been worth on that date, given that it represents a small shareholding in a private company.  But, leaving that all aside, I find myself unable to accept the defendants’ contention on the applicability of Art 4.3 to what has happened in this case in the first place.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span> It is quite clear that the “moratorium” in Art 4.3 applies in the typical situation when new shares are given to the RSU Plan’s participant upon the vesting of their RSUs in accordance with the scheduled dates of vesting as set out in the grants.  Where shares are to be provided to plan participants pursuant to Art 4.3, SAIS retains a <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> as to when<span class="font-italic"> </span>that will take place, so long as it happens by the end of the third year following the year of the grant of those RSUs which have vested (see [44] above).  On the other hand, where there has been a Change of Control event, Art 5.3 provides that shares must be provided to plan participants pursuant to awarded and vested RSUs “immediately” (see [70] above).  This distinction between Arts 4.3 and 5.3 suggests that where shares are provided to a plan participant on the occurrence of a Change of Control event, he must also be able to realise his RSU entitlements in a timely fashion.  Otherwise, that will make a nonsense of the requirement in Art 5.3 for shares to be provided “immediately”, as opposed to at a time of SAIS’s choosing.  I thus find that Art 4.3 does not apply to the atypical situation where a Change of Control event has occurred.  A more precise or detailed provision like Art 5.3 should override a general or widely expressed provision like Art 4.3, which is inconsistent with it (see <span class="font-italic">Zu</span><span class="font-italic">rich Insurance </span>([56] above) at [131]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>Likewise, I find it difficult to accept that the Art 4.3 “moratorium” can apply to a situation where shares were promised to be given to an employee by a certain date, as part of the payments due to him upon his resignation from the company, as in the case of Mr Hardman’s 72,590 SAIS shares given for the 2018 Bonus and which should have been provided by the end of February 2020.  Such a situation is similar to one where Art 5.3 applies because the relevant SAIS shares are also to be provided to the employee by a particular time agreed to by <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties, as opposed to at a time of SAIS’s choosing.  In such a situation, the employee should also be able to realise his RSU entitlements in a timely fashion.  Otherwise, it would have been pointless for parties to have entered into an agreement in the first place for those shares to be provided by a particular date. The “moratorium” in Art 4.3 should therefore also not apply to the SAIS shares that ought to have been given to Mr Hardman by the end of February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>    I should add that it accords with commercial sense and the purpose of the RSU Plan that there should not be any “moratorium” period when a Change of Control event has occurred, or when the RSU Plan participant’s employment has already been terminated.  As a matter of business reality, when there has been a Change of Control, this is often followed by or accompanied with changes being made to the business direction of the company.  It is commonplace that new controllers may decide to bring in new management.  That, in turn, may lead to existing members of management leaving the company or the group.  Given that one of the key underlying purposes of the RSU Plan is to provide the SAIS Group’s employees with a stake in the company in which they are working, it would make business sense that they have the choice of selling off their shares on the occurrence of a Change of Control event.  Being able to monetise their shares by selling them also provides the departing employee with a financial cushion as he moves on to another opportunity, especially if he is leaving because he has been made redundant.  As such, I reject the argument by the defendants (see [50]-[51] above) that the “moratorium” period in Art 4.3 is in any way relevant to the shares that the plaintiffs should have been provided with on 13 September 2019, or 29 February 2020, in the case of Mr Hardman’s 72,590 shares given for the 2018 Bonus.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">135 </span>Although the parties’ submissions have at times referred to the defendants collectively and drew no distinction between the conduct of SAIS and/or Kaddra, it is not the plaintiffs’ pleaded position that the defendants should be jointly and severally liable to them for damages for breach of contract.   In respect of those SAIS shares which the plaintiffs say should have been provided to them on 13 September 2019 under Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan but which were not provided as such (see [87] and [118] above), the plaintiffs pleaded that it is SAIS alone that is liable to pay damages.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>The plaintiffs’ pleaded position is sensible and appropriate.  Although the SAIS shares were promised to the plaintiffs as part of their employment in SPL/Kaddra, both of which are companies within the SAIS Group, the plaintiffs’ entitlement to be provided with SAIS shares on 13 September 2019 stem from the agreement between themselves and SAIS, as constituted by the RSU Agreement Forms which they have executed, as well as the RSU Plan (and Art 5.3) that is incorporated by those forms.  Kaddra is not a party to that agreement and cannot be made liable for SAIS’s failure to provide shares to the plaintiffs under the terms of that agreement.  On the other hand, in respect of the 72,590 SAIS shares representing the 2018 Bonus, while Mr Hardman’s entitlement to those shares would also stem from a similar agreement between himself and SAIS, his claim<span class="font-italic"> </span>to be provided with those shares by the end of February 2020 stems from the Bonus Agreement, in respect of which Kaddra<span class="font-italic"> </span>had undertaken to ensure the same.  It is the latter agreement<span class="font-italic"> </span>which Mr Hardman relies upon for his claim in the present proceedings, and so only Kaddra (but not SAIS), which is a party to that agreement, can be liable in damages as a result of Mr Hardman not being provided with the 72,590 SAIS shares by the end of February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>Therefore, for the reasons set out above, I find that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) SAIS is liable to pay Mr Hardman CAD 266,158.00 in damages for failing to provide Mr Hardman with 133,079 SAIS shares on 13 September 2019 as it had been required under Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Kaddra is liable to pay Mr Hardman CAD 9,436.70 in damages for failing to ensure that Mr Hardman was provided with 72,590 SAIS shares by 29 February 2020 as it had been required under the terms of the Bonus Agreement; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) SAIS is liable to pay Mr Finck CAD 76,520.00 in damages for failing to provide Mr Finck with 38,260 SAIS shares on 13 September 2019 as it had been required under Art 5.3 of the RSU Plan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>For the reasons explained at [123]-[129] above, I dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim against Mr Hardman for his breach of fiduciary duties to the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I will deal separately with the issue of interest on the sums owing by the defendants and also on the issue of costs of these proceedings.</span></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Richard Sharpe (Sharpe &amp; Jagger LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leong Li Shiong and Goh Peizhi Adeline (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
