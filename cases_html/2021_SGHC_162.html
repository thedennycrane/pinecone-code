Accordingly, even if the word “appeal” were given the extended meaning contended for by the defendant, Malaysian OS 455 still did not amount to an appeal. This is because all that it would do, taking it at its highest, would be to give the defendant more time to pay what was due under the consent judgment. The order adjudging the sum payable by the defendant would not be affected.

In truth, Malaysian OS 455 affirmed the validity and binding nature of the consent judgment. Its first prayer was for a declaration that the consent judgment was valid and binding. Its second prayer was for a declaration confirming that the amount due remained as agreed under the consent judgment. Its third prayer did not seek variation of any part of the consent judgment but rather sought “a reasonable extension of time to comply with [his] obligations” thereunder. The fourth prayer sought relief from forfeiture. The fifth prayer was for costs, and the sixth was a sweep-up prayer for any further orders deemed fair and just. Nothing in it sought the setting aside of the consent judgment.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 That was sufficient to dispose of this argument. However, I add that I also did not accept the premise that the word “appeal” in RECJA s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) carries any extended meaning. That one statute expressly defines a word more broadly than another does not mean that the same word used in another statute is also broadened in meaning. RECJA was enacted in 1921, while REFJA was enacted in 1959. The meaning of the word “appeal” in RECJA did not change because it received a broader definition in a new statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The question could be put in a subtler and potentially more persuasive way, namely whether the broader definition in REFJA evidences an underlying purpose or rationale, already in existence in 1921, that supports giving the word “appeal” a broader purposive meaning in RECJA. This requires considering the context in which the word “appeal” is used in REFJA. When one does so, this reformulated argument also fails. In fact, there is no equivalent to RECJA s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) restricting registration of a judgment that is under appeal. Instead, REFJA provides that for recognised courts of a foreign country to which Part 1 of REFJA has been extended by ministerial order in the Gazette, a judgment of such courts will be eligible for registration so long as it is “final and conclusive as between the parties to it, unless it is an interlocutory judgment”: see REFJA s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). A judgment is taken to be final and conclusive even though an appeal is pending against it or it may still be subject to appeal in the courts of the country of the original court: see REFJA s 3(5). That a judgment would be regarded as final and conclusive notwithstanding an appeal was the position from first enactment in 1959, as seen from s 3(3) of the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance 1959 (No 29 of 1959): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) For the purposes of this section, a judgment shall be deemed to be final and conclusive notwithstanding that an appeal may be pending against it, or that it may still be subject to appeal, in the courts of the country of the original court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 So, in fact, REFJA provides that once a foreign judgment is eligible for registration, it remains registrable notwithstanding any appeal or possibility of appeal. What REFJA s 6 provides is that the existence of an ongoing or intended appeal (in its expanded meaning that includes a setting aside application) founds a discretion in the registering court either to set aside the registration or to adjourn the application to set aside the registration until disposal of the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Given that this is the case, REFJA’s extended definition of “appeal” that includes other possible challenges to a judgment, such as a setting-aside, makes clear that none of those challenges would make a judgment any less “final and conclusive” for the purpose of REFJA. Thus, the extended definition of “appeal” contained in REFJA suggests a more recent legislative policy of permitting enforcement of foreign judgments even if they are under appeal or subject to a setting aside application, while giving the registering court a discretion to set aside the registration or adjourn the setting aside application pending disposal of the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 This approach taken in REFJA echoes that taken by the common law to the enforcement of foreign judgments. It is well-established that a foreign judgment may be enforced at common law if it is a money judgment, pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction and final and conclusive between the parties, so long as it was not procured either by fraud, or in breach of natural justice, and its enforcement in Singapore would not be against public policy. The foreign judgment is treated as creating a new cause of action that is independent of the underlying dispute in relation to which the judgment was given. The test of finality at common law only requires that the judgment be final and conclusive in the <span class="font-italic">particular</span> court in which it was pronounced. That a judgment may be altered or varied on appeal would not render it any less final and conclusive. A judgment between parties is <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> until successfully appealed or set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Thus, the approach taken by RECJA to pending appeals is distinct from that under REFJA or the common law: RECJA restricts registration where there is an appeal pending, unlike REFJA or common law enforcement. It is more restrictive than the other regimes in this respect. There is nothing in REFJA that supports broadening the restriction on registration under RECJA that does not even exist under REFJA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Does registering the consent judgment prior to the final disposal of any appeal from Malaysian OS 455 violate public policy?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendant’s second contention is that registering the consent judgment prior to the final disposal of any appeal from Malaysian OS 455 violates public policy. The public policy identified by the defendant is that of international comity. It is argued that allowing the consent judgment to be registered is assisting the plaintiff to “circumvent the application of Malaysia law and the Malaysia court process”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It should be remembered that the public policy provision of RECJA s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) restricts registration of a foreign judgment only where “the judgment was in respect of a cause of action which for reasons of public policy or for some other similar reason could not have been entertained by the registering court”. That restriction was not what the defendant invoked here, as there is no suggestion that the underlying cause of action in this matter contravenes Singapore public policy. Instead, what the defendant sought to rely on was its broader counterpart at common law, whereby a local court will refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment if its enforcement would be contrary to public policy.

</div>
</div> This was, however, a step too far. The list of restrictions on registration of judgments under RECJA s 3(2) offers no room for the court to insert any additional, non-statutory restriction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In any case, I did not accept the defendant’s contention that registration of the consent judgment would be a breach of international comity and therefore of Singapore’s public policy. It was argued that it is disrespectful to the foreign court to recognise or register its judgment when that judgment is under appeal or subject to setting aside under that court’s processes. But this argument fails, because there is no reason to say that refusing to recognise and register a final and conclusive judgment of a country (where enforcement is not stayed) because there is an outstanding appeal or setting aside application is more respectful of its law or processes than recognising or registering that judgment, notwithstanding the outstanding appeal or setting aside application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I therefore concluded that international comity does not make it a breach of Singapore public policy to register a foreign judgment that is under appeal or subject to a setting aside application. The court applies the relevant statutory regime, and if that regime mandates registration of a foreign judgment that is under appeal or subject to a setting aside application, then that is the end of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In any event, as I have already noted, Malaysian OS 455 affirms the consent judgment rather than seeking to set it aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Does Malaysian OS 455 constitute a circumstance making it unjust or inconvenient to register the consent judgment?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Notwithstanding that the existence of Malaysian OS 455 did not restrict the registration of the consent judgment under RECJA s 3(2), I accepted that it might potentially be relevant to the exercise of my discretion under RECJA s 3(1). I asked myself whether it was a circumstance that made it unjust or inconvenient to register the consent judgment. I concluded that Malaysian OS 455 was not a reason for me to decline to register the consent judgment. Even if the appeal against its dismissal succeeded, it would simply mean that the defendant would have more time to comply with the consent judgment. In the meantime, the plaintiff had a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> right to the fruits of the consent judgment. I considered that the plaintiff should not be deprived of this right just because the defendant was seeking more time to comply with it. I was fortified in this view by the fact that the defendant had failed to obtain more time from the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur (Commercial Division), which had dismissed his application before the appeal came up before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I also considered the issue whether it was appropriate to either stay the registration proceedings or stay enforcement of the registered judgment, pending the final disposal of Malaysian OS 455. I concluded that it was not appropriate. I noted that the consent judgment was not subject to any stay of enforcement in Malaysia.
