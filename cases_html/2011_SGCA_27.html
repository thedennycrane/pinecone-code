<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal was brought by the Prosecution
                    against the sentence of six years’ imprisonment imposed by the High Court
                    on the respondent for causing the death of his 23-month-old daughter
                    (“the Child”) as a result of the physical injuries which he
                    inflicted upon her. The respondent was held guilty of culpable homicide not
                    amounting to murder under s 304(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”) on the
                    grounds that his acts of violence towards the Child were “done with the
                    knowledge that [they were] likely to cause death, but without any intention to
                    cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as [was] likely to cause
                    death” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v AFR</em> [2010]
                    SGHC 82 (“the GD on conviction”) at [47]). At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, we were
                    satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that the
                    punishment imposed by the trial judge (“the Judge”) was manifestly
                    inadequate and substituted it with a term of imprisonment of ten years, plus ten
                    strokes of the cane. We now give our reasons for so deciding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 6 January 2009 at around 6.30pm, the
                    respondent and his wife, [B], left their three young daughters –
                    <em>viz</em>, the Child (who was the eldest), [C] (then
                    aged one) and [D] (then aged two months) – asleep in their flat
                    (“the Flat”) while they went out to buy groceries. At the
                    supermarket, the respondent saw some dolls for sale and suggested to [B] that
                    they should buy one for the Child as her birthday was approaching. The
                    respondent and [B] returned home at around 7.30pm. Upon entering the Flat, the
                    respondent saw the Child playing with and chewing on his cigarettes, with
                    several cigarettes scattered on the floor. At that point in time, [B] was still
                    outside the door of the Flat putting their shoes in place. The respondent
                    shouted at the Child and asked her why she was so stubborn. [B] heard the
                    shouts. The respondent also asked the Child why she did not play with her toys
                    instead. According to the respondent, the Child had done something similar to
                    his cigarettes two days earlier, and he had warned her then not to touch his
                    cigarettes. Subsequently, the respondent brought the Child into the kitchen so
                    that his voice would not be overheard by the neighbours. By this time, [B] had
                    entered the living room and was sweeping up the cigarettes, after which she
                    attended to [C] and [D], who were crying in the bedroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As the respondent started to scold the Child in
                    the kitchen, the latter began to cry. According to the respondent, he felt
                    stressed because the Child was crying very loudly, and, moreover, he had a lot
                    of things on his mind at that time. The respondent explained that he felt
                    stressed as he was then earning a low salary and was not able to feed his family
                    well. He also had issues with [B] as a man had been sending her text messages
                    and calling her recently. As the Child cried, the respondent slapped her several
                    times (according to the respondent, he slapped her four times). We would at this
                    juncture point out that at the trial, Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist
                    Dr [EN], who conducted the post-mortem examination of the Child on
                    7 January 2009, testified that the bruises found on the Child had been
                    caused by a much more severe force than a slap, and had most likely been caused
                    by <em>punches</em> instead. The respondent claimed that
                    after slapping the Child, he punched her upper arms several times. As the Child
                    could not take the pain, she turned her body away from him. Despite this, the
                    respondent continued to hit her several more times (according to the
                    respondent’s evidence, he “<em>smacked</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added] her several
                    times).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Thereafter, the Child fell into a kneeling
                    position. Even so, <em>the respondent continued to punch her arms
                        a few times while she was still kneeling</em>. While the Child’s
                    back was facing him, the respondent pulled both of the Child’s ears and
                    again hit the Child’s back a few times. At about this time, [B] walked
                    into the kitchen. According to [B], <em>the respondent kicked and
                        stamped on the Child’s back several times</em> while the Child
                    was in a seated position on the floor with her upper body bent forward so that
                        <em>her chest and face were touching the floor</em>.
                    [B] saw the respondent kick the left side of the Child’s back several
                    times with the upper part of his foot. Shortly after, the Child was observed to
                    be weak and “gasping for breath”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> [B] called for an ambulance,
                    and the Child was taken to [PD] Hospital, where she was pronounced dead
                    approximately 50 minutes after her arrival.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The cause of the Child’s death was
                    certified as “haemopericardium, due to … ruptured inferior vena
                        cava”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> [capital letters in original
                    omitted] –
                    <em>ie</em>, the Child’s inferior vena cava
                    (“IVC”), the vein which carries de-oxygenated blood from the lower
                    half of the body to the right atrium of the heart, had ruptured, and the severe
                    bleeding had caused her heart to fail. Although the respondent denied ever using
                    his feet to stamp on the Child’s back, it is pertinent to note at this
                    juncture that the medical evidence, which will be elaborated on in further
                    detail at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>–<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> below, showed that [B]’s evidence
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, that the respondent had <em>kicked and stamped on</em> the Child – was consistent with the
                    rupture of the Child’s IVC and the injuries which she
                suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The respondent was charged with the murder of
                    the Child. At the conclusion of the trial, the Judge found that the respondent
                    was not guilty of murder. However, in exercise of the powers conferred under
                    s 175(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed),
                    the Judge (as mentioned at [1] above)
                    convicted the respondent of the lesser offence of culpable homicide not
                    amounting to murder under s 304(<em>b</em>) of the PC,
                    which provides for punishment “with imprisonment for a term which may
                    extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of
                    such punishments”. The Judge only imposed a sentence of six years’
                    imprisonment without any caning or fine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Judge reviewed some authorities and
                    expressed the view that the imprisonment sentences imposed in previous
                        s 304(<em>b</em>) cases (<em>ie</em>, cases under s 304(<em>b</em>) of
                    the PC or the corresponding provision in earlier revised editions of the PC)
                    which involved young victims ranged from five to seven years’
                    imprisonment, “with ten years being imposed in an egregious case
                    involving a three[-]month[-]old infant” (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v AFR</em> [2010] SGHC 230 (“the GD on
                    sentence”) at [12]). In imposing
                    the sentence which he did, the Judge took into consideration two factors. First,
                    the respondent had acted in a moment of uncontrollable anger, and, second, the
                    respondent was remorseful for killing the Child, whom he had loved dearly. The
                    Judge said at [12] of the GD on
                    sentence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the [Child] was the natural daughter of the
                        [respondent], the oldest of three girls and, as was clear from the evidence,
                            <em>one whom he loved dearly</em>. Indeed the
                        offence was committed just after he had returned home from a shopping trip
                        during which he had decided at [<em>sic</em>] the spur
                        of the moment to buy her a doll for her upcoming second birthday. The
                        knowledge that, in that <em>moment of uncontrolled
                            anger</em>, he had brought this tragedy upon the [Child] and his
                        wife and above all, [upon] himself, <em>will never be erased
                            from his conscience no matter how many years he is imprisoned as
                            punishment</em>. <em>That is a burden he will bear
                            for the rest of his life and no punishment meted out by this court can
                            be greater than that</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge also did not think, although he did not elaborate on his
                    reasons, that this was a case which merited the imposition of either a fine or
                    caning on the respondent (see the GD on sentence at [4]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments presented on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before this court, the Prosecution took the
                    position that the sentence of six years’ imprisonment was wholly
                    inadequate and disproportionate in view of the overall gravity of the
                    respondent’s conduct, and submitted that a longer term of imprisonment as
                    well as caning should be imposed. The Prosecution argued that the Judge had
                    failed to give sufficient consideration to the need for deterrence, especially
                    the need to send a strong and clear message to the public that mistreatment of
                    young children would not be tolerated. The Prosecution contended, in particular,
                    that the Judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the following aggravating
                    factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     the vulnerability and defencelessness
                        of the Child, given her young age and the fact that she was still very much
                        a baby;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        manner in which the offence was committed, which involved serious violence
                        and which would have caused much pain and suffering to the
                    Child;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        respondent’s blatant violation of his duty as the Child’s
                        biological father to protect and care for her; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     the general difficulty of detecting and
                        preventing offences that occur within the confines of a
                home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Prosecution further argued that the Judge
                    had placed undue weight on the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     the respondent had committed the
                        offence on the spur of the moment in a fit of “uncontrolled
                        anger” (see the GD on sentence at [12]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the respondent had been a loving father to the Child;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the offence
                        would never be erased from the respondent’s conscience and would be a
                        burden which he would have to bear for the rest of his
                life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Prosecution also took the position that
                    the Judge had failed to accord sufficient weight to the relevant sentencing
                    precedents which showed that longer terms of imprisonment had been imposed for
                    offences similar to that committed by the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On his part, the respondent emphasised before
                    this court that he had been under a lot of stress during the period leading up
                    to the tragic incident on 6 January 2009 (“the Incident”),
                    and that his actions in beating the Child were the result of a build-up of
                    pent-up emotions and stresses. In particular, he alluded to the fact that:
                    (a) he did not earn a high salary; (b) he had to work at night and had
                    difficulties sleeping during the day due to the children’s cries; and
                    (c) he had suspected [B] of having an affair. The respondent asserted that
                    he was not someone who would lose his temper easily. He claimed that he had led
                    a relatively crime-free life prior to the Incident. He contended that not all
                    the injuries found on the Child should be attributed to him as some had been
                    caused by mosquito bites and the Child’s frequent falls. The respondent
                    also claimed that by the time of his sentencing by the Judge, his second
                    daughter, [C], had already forgiven him for what he had done and hoped (so it
                    was alleged) to see him home as soon as possible. He added that if a long
                    imprisonment term were to be imposed on him, [B] would have difficulties in
                    raising the two younger daughters, [C] and [D], on her own.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In view of the disturbing brutal violence
                    inflicted on the Child (as described at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above and
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> below) and the disconcerting increase in the incidence of
                    domestic violence cases involving young children, this court, in coming to its
                    decision on the present appeal, felt compelled to send a clear signal to all
                    parents and caregivers (<em>ie</em>, those in a position of
                    authority over and/or having a duty of care in relation to young children) that
                    any unwarranted infliction of violence on young children would not be tolerated
                    and would be met with the full force of the law. No parent or caregiver has
                    licence to inflict violence with impunity on any young children under his
                    charge. Any parent or caregiver who does so will not be allowed to mitigate his
                    culpability on the ground of financial or social problems, nor will he be
                    allowed (for mitigation purposes) to exclaim with regret that he did not mean to
                    inflict violence on the victim in question, whom he professes to love. As
                    emphasised by this court in <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em>
                    [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<em>UI</em>”), a
                    parent or caregiver who breaches the trust and confidence reposed in him by
                    abusing his child or ward will face the most severe condemnation of the law. The
                    following observations, which were made in <em>UI</em> (at
                        [33]) in the context of sexual abuse
                    of a young child, are just as germane to the present situation, which involves
                    physical abuse of a young child:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ultimate relationship of trust and authority is that between a parent
                        and his or her child. There exists between them a human relationship in
                        which the parent has a moral obligation to look after and care for the
                        child. In our view, the level of confidence and trust that a child naturally
                        reposes in his or her parent entails that a parent who betrays that trust
                        and harms the child stands at the <em>furthest</em> end
                        of the spectrum of guilt ... [emphasis in original]</p>

                    three-year-old child, the High Court (<em>per</em> Chan Sek

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he gravity of the offence would be increased in cases
                        involving vulnerable victims. Children and young persons are particularly
                        vulnerable because they are unable to fend for themselves and require their
                        parents or guardians to take care of them. Any person entrusted with the
                        care of young children would be harshly dealt with if that trust is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It can be readily seen from the relevant
                    sentencing precedents that our courts have consistently adopted a tough stance
                    towards offenders who cause the deaths of defenceless young victims by
                    violence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The maximum imprisonment term of ten years has
                    been imposed in s 304(<em>b</em>) cases which involve
                    a <em>parent</em> causing the death of his biological child
                    by violence. For instance, in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ismail
                        Bin Abdullah @ Nai Henry</em> Criminal Case No 37 of 1994
                    (unreported) (“<em>Mohd Ismail</em>”), the
                    maximum imprisonment term of ten years was imposed on the accused who, overcome
                    with anger after having twice caught his four-year-old daughter playing with the
                    gas cylinder in the kitchen of his home, pushed his daughter’s head into a
                    pail of water, killing her in the process. Similarly, the maximum imprisonment
                    sentence of ten years’ imprisonment was imposed in the
                        s 304(<em>b</em>) case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Devadass s/o Suppaiyah</em> Criminal Case
                    No 41 of 1997 (unreported) (“<em>Devadass</em>”), where the accused, who was frustrated by the
                    cries of his three-month-old son, held his son by the neck, slapped him hard
                    several times and then threw him onto a mattress on the floor, causing his death
                    as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In respect of <em>caregivers</em> who cause the deaths of young children under their
                    care, the period of imprisonment imposed by our courts has generally been only
                    slightly shorter than the maximum ten-year period prescribed by
                        s 304(<em>b</em>) of the PC. For instance, in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Dwi Arti Samad</em> Criminal
                    Case No 12 of 2000 (unreported) (“<em>Dwi Arti
                        Samad</em>”), an eight-year imprisonment term was imposed on
                    the accused, a 22-year-old maid, who, irritated by the constant cries of her
                    employer’s 15-month-old son, picked him up and dropped him onto the floor,
                    thereby causing his death. (We should at this juncture point out that <em>Mohd Ismail</em>, <em>Devadass</em> and
                        <em>Dwi Arti Samad</em> all concerned
                        s 304(<em>b</em>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Penal Code”), as opposed to
                        s 304(<em>b</em>) of the PC; there is, however, no
                    difference between these two versions of s 304(<em>b</em>) as far as the punishment of imprisonment is
                    concerned.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     
          <em>Firdaus</em>,
                    although not a s 304(<em>b</em>) case, is particularly
                    germane to the present appeal because of the similarity in the essential facts.
                    In <em>Firdaus</em>, the accused faced (<em>inter alia</em>) a charge under s 325 of the 1985 Penal Code of
                        <em>voluntarily causing grievous hurt</em> to his
                    three-year-old stepson. The accused, who was then cohabiting with the
                    child’s mother, lost his temper with the child because of the
                    latter’s crying. He threw four or five punches at the child’s face
                    and forehead, jabbed upwards at the child’s chin and slammed the child
                    into a wall. He thereafter continued to slap the child’s back, at which
                    point the child stopped crying. The child died from his injuries. In view of the
                    egregious violence inflicted on the child and the serious injuries caused, which
                    resulted in the child’s death, the High Court decided that the case
                    constituted “the worst category of cases of causing grievous hurt”
                    (see <em>Firdaus</em> at [22]) and imposed the <em>maximum imprisonment
                        sentence</em> under s 325 of the 1985 Penal Code of seven
                    years’ imprisonment; the accused was also sentenced to <em>12 strokes of the cane</em> in respect of the s 325 charge.
                    Together with the sentences imposed on the accused in respect of two charges
                    under s 5(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38,
                    2001 Rev Ed) (“the CYPA”) of ill-treating the child, the High
                    Court imposed a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes
                    of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Also of relevance to the present appeal is the
                    recent District Court case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohd Azhar
                        Ghapar</em> Subordinate Courts Case No 31981 of 2010
                    (unreported), where the accused, who was the babysitter of his
                    girlfriend’s two-year-old daughter, inflicted egregious violence and abuse
                    on the child, which resulted in her death. The accused had taken out his anger
                    on the child by punching her abdomen and pinching her arms, ear, chest and
                    stomach. The accused had also head-butted the child more than once, and had even
                    stepped on her abdomen, thereby fracturing her ribs. The accused pleaded guilty
                    to two charges under s 325 of the PC of voluntarily causing grievous hurt
                    and three charges under s 5(1) of the CYPA of ill-treating the child. The
                    District Court imposed a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and 12
                    strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the present case, the brutal manner in
                    which the offence was committed and the horrendous violence which was
                    senselessly inflicted on the Child (as shown at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above and
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> below) were no less heinous than the brutality and violence
                    inflicted on the child in <em>Firdaus</em>. If the
                    respondent in the present case had been charged with and convicted of the lesser
                    offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the 1985 Penal
                    Code (<em>viz</em>, the provision invoked in <em>Firdaus</em>), there is, in our view, no doubt that in
                    keeping with <em>Firdaus</em>, he would have received the
                    maximum imprisonment term of seven years (<em>cf</em> the
                    maximum imprisonment term under s 325 of the PC, which is now ten years).
                    This would be <em>longer</em> than the term of imprisonment
                    imposed by the Judge in the present case. Given that the respondent was
                    convicted of the <em>much more serious offence</em> of
                    culpable homicide not amounting to murder (as compared to the offence of
                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt), the respondent should, therefore, have
                    received a sentence that was more severe than that imposed in <em>Firdaus</em> for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt
                    (which was seven years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane). Yet, not
                    only did the Judge impose an imprisonment term shorter than that in <em>Firdaus</em>, he also did not impose any caning on the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As can be seen from the precedents discussed
                    above, our courts have unequivocally adopted a robust sentencing policy towards
                    parents and caregivers who inflict senseless violence on young victims. Society
                    has a special interest in protecting the young from physical abuse, particularly
                    by those whose duty it is to care for the young under their charge. In every
                    case of physical abuse of a young child by a parent or caregiver, there is gross
                    abuse of physical disparity by the offender, which manifests itself in the form
                    of inhumane treatment of a vulnerable young victim. Public interest demands the
                    imposition of a severe sentence in this situation: the court has to send a clear
                    signal that offences involving physical violence against helpless children are
                    regarded with deep abhorrence and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     To this end, the sentencing judge must first
                    determine whether the case at hand is one where physical abuse of a young child
                    by a parent or caregiver has led to the death of the child in circumstances
                    which constitute an offence punishable under s 304(<em>b</em>) of the PC. If that question is answered in the affirmative,
                    then a term of imprisonment of between eight to ten years <em>and</em> caning of not less than six strokes should ordinarily be
                    imposed as a starting point. Second, the sentencing judge must also take into
                    consideration any mitigating circumstances and/or aggravating factors pertinent
                    to the precise factual context. For example, in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Sumarni Binti Pono</em> Criminal Case No 11 of 2001
                    (unreported), a sentence of only five years’ imprisonment was imposed on
                    the accused pursuant to s 304(<em>b</em>) of the 1985
                    Penal Code for causing the death of her two-year-old nephew. This was because
                    the medical evidence showed that the accused had at the material time
                    experienced “an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which culminated
                    in an Acute Stress Reaction”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With the above considerations in mind, we now
                    turn to explain why we were of the view that the Judge (with respect) gave
                        <em>insufficient</em> weight to the <em>aggravating</em> factors in the present case and <em>undue</em> weight to the <em>mitigating</em>
                    factors relied on by the respondent, thereby resulting in the sentence imposed
                    being manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s failure to give sufficient weight to the relevant
                aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the extreme violence and
                    force inflicted on the Child were undeniably clear. The respondent repeatedly
                    punched the Child even when she had fallen into a <em>kneeling
                        position</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above); her IVC was ruptured as a result of the violence
                    inflicted on her, and she died minutes thereafter. Rupture of the IVC is an
                    injury that is <em>very rare</em>: Dr [EN]’s
                    evidence in this regard was that such an injury was more commonly seen in
                        <em>high-speed collisions</em>. This only goes to show
                    the intensity of the violence inflicted on the Child, which resulted in
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) contusion (bleeding) in her
                    caecum and her left lung. The pain and suffering caused to the Child must have
                    been unbearably severe as, during the post-mortem examination, her pericardial
                    cavity (the cavity in the chest where the heart sits) was found to contain 40ml
                    of blood. In addition, there were, as Dr [EN] found during the post-mortem
                    examination, 58 external injuries to the Child, consisting of bruises and
                    abrasions distributed all over her body: her scalp, face, ears, neck, arms,
                    chest, back, abdomen, external genitalia, anus, hip, buttocks and
                thighs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In our view, the Judge did not accord
                    sufficient weight to the heinous manner in which violence was inflicted upon a
                    helpless child of less than two years old, who could do nothing but remain where
                    she was and receive the abuse inflicted on her. Although the Judge noted in the
                    GD on conviction the horrendous manner in which the Child was beaten by the
                    respondent at the material time (including the respondent’s vicious
                    stamping on her back), it appeared from the GD on sentence that he did not give
                    sufficient weight to that factor for sentencing purposes, nor did he regard it
                    as an aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In this connection, we noted earlier that the
                    respondent denied ever using his feet to stamp on the Child’s back (see
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). His evidence on this point
                    was, however, contradicted by [B], who said in her statement dated 29 July
                    2009 (at para 12) that she saw the respondent “kicking and <em>stepping on</em> [the Child’s] left back several
                        times”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added] in the course
                    of the Incident. [B] also demonstrated in court, by the use of a mannequin, how
                    the respondent had stamped on the Child’s back with his feet several times
                    and how he had kicked the left side of the Child’s back even when the
                    Child’s chest and face were touching the floor. More significantly,
                    [B]’s evidence that the respondent had stamped on the Child’s back
                    is consistent with the medical evidence of Dr [EN], who testified as

                                            punch by free mechanisms. One is that you swing your
                                            shoulder so that you impart force through the punch
                                            while locking your elbow, one is that you swing your
                                            waist and one is that you move your foot forward so
                                            you’re increasing the acceleration into your punch
                                            and this is what I mean by severe punching. And …
                                            severe punching is like, for example, if a person is
                                            throwing a baseball. If you are throwing a baseball,
                                            you’re not just using your arm to throw it,
                                            you’re using your entire body with the swing and
                                            the rotation of the hip and this imparts greater
                                            acceleration to the baseball. If you just throw a
                                            baseball, just using your arm, you might throw it at a
                                            very slow speed. But top baseball players, for example,
                                            who learn how to throw with their entire body, not just
                                            the arm, can easily reach speeds of 60, 70, 80,
                                            90 kilometres per hour of the ball, for example. So
                                            this is why I use the terms [<em>sic</em>] ‘severe punch’. Then
                                                <b><em>in terms of kicking and stamping

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It would appear that the Judge accepted
                    Dr [EN]’s evidence that the rupture of the Child’s IVC was
                    consistent with her having been stamped on by the respondent in the course of
                    the Incident. This can be seen from [11]
                    of the GD on conviction, where the Judge stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 7 January 2009, Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist
                        Dr [[EN]] performed the post-mortem examination on the [Child]. He
                        certified the cause of death to be haemopericardium due to a ruptured IVC.
                        Dr [[EN]] opined that the rupture of the IVC sustained by the [Child]
                        was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that,
                        based on [[B]]’s account of events, it was due to the mechanism of
                        [the] kicking, stamping, punching of the [Child] by the respondent. When
                        asked how certain he was as to when the rupture of the IVC occurred,
                            <em>Dr [[EN]] testified that the rupture of the IVC
                            had occurred during the time of the kicking and stamping</em>, as
                        otherwise “no reason why [the Child] should be becoming weaker and
                        then losing consciousness, unless there were some injury to the brain, for
                        example, there is a head injury. In this case, there was none.”
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Indeed, the following statement at [37] of the GD on conviction made it clear
                    beyond doubt that the Judge accepted [B]’s evidence that the respondent
                    had kicked and stepped on the Child’s back:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The respondent] had used his fist <em>and feet</em>
                        on the [Child]. He had hit her until there was severe bruising below the
                        skin in several instances. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Yet, nothing was said in the GD on sentence
                    about the respondent kicking and stamping on the Child. This left us in
                    considerable doubt as to whether this aspect of the physical abuse inflicted on
                    the Child, which was clearly an aggravating factor, was given sufficient
                    consideration by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Given that this was a clear case where heinous
                    and violent conduct caused the death of a helpless young victim, it was plain to
                    us that the two main sentencing considerations relevant in determining the
                    appropriate punishment were that of deterrence and retribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On general deterrence, we have emphasised (at
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) that social and financial
                    problems would provide absolutely no excuse for parents or caregivers to vent
                    their frustrations by physically abusing young children under their care. With
                    regard to specific deterrence, we noted that the other two children of the
                    respondent, [C] and [D], would still be at the vulnerable age of around four to
                    five years old if the respondent were imprisoned for only the six-year term
                    imposed by the Judge (on the assumption that the respondent is granted remission
                    of sentence for good conduct).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    sentencing consideration of retribution, we have shown above how the Child was a
                    victim of senseless brutality and mindless violence that was manifestly
                    disproportionate to whatever irritation her disobedience in playing with and
                    chewing on the respondent’s cigarettes might have caused the respondent.
                    Indeed, the Child was literally battered like a lifeless doll. In the
                    circumstances, the demands of retributive justice mandate that a heavy sentence
                    must be imposed on the respondent to ensure that his punishment is proportionate
                    to his culpability as reflected by the viciousness with which he inflicted
                    violence on the Child. As opined by Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth in
                        <em>Proportionate Sentencing: Exploring the
                        Principles</em> (Oxford University Press, 2005) at p 4:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Proportionalist sentencing is designed to avoid unjust results –
                        through giving conceptions of justice a central role in sentencing policy.
                        The desert rationale rests on the idea that <b><em>the penal
                            sanction should fairly reflect the degree of reprehensibleness (that is,
                            the harmfulness and culpability) of the actor’s
                        conduct</em></b>. This comports with common-sense notions of justice, that
                            <b><em>how severely a person is punished should depend on
                            the degree of blameworthiness of his conduct</em></b>. … In
                        desert theory, the societal interest is expressed in the recognition that
                        typical crimes (eg, those of force …) are <em>wrongs</em>, for which public censure through criminal sanction
                        is due. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There are some other comments which we would
                    make in this regard. The respondent blamed the Child for playing with and
                    chewing on his cigarettes, and alleged that her conduct caused him to in turn
                    lose his head and do what he did. He relied on the fact that two days prior to
                    the Incident, the Child had done something similar to his cigarettes, and he had
                    warned her then not to do so. He said that the Child was being naughty and
                    stubborn. But, a child of that age is by nature curious and her understanding,
                    limited. It is not at all surprising that such a young child might not be able
                    to fully understand the sense of a previous warning or to remember it when the
                    same curious object which prompted the earlier warning reappears before her. If
                    blame is to be attributed, we have no doubt that it should fall on the
                    respondent. He should not have left his cigarettes within reach of the Child. If
                    he had kept his cigarettes away that fateful day, the Child would not have
                    played with them. He would then not have become angry with the Child and would
                    not have beaten her as badly as he did, and she in turn would surely still have
                    been alive today. The respondent also claimed that on that fateful evening, he
                    had hit the Child to discipline her. However, no parent or caregiver can ever
                    justify punching or stamping on a child so hard as to cause the rupture of the
                    IVC – an injury which, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above, is very rare. The measure of discipline imposed by a
                    parent or caregiver on a child must be commensurate with the age and the extent
                    of understanding of that child. What the respondent did in the course of the
                    Incident went well beyond what any sensible person would have done by way of
                    discipline. Indeed, this was one of the worst cases of child abuse encountered
                    by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In view of the aggravating factors in the
                    present case, and taking into consideration the sentencing principles of
                    deterrence and retributive justice, we were of the view that the
                    respondent’s culpability fell within the most egregious end of the
                    spectrum of s 304(<em>b</em>) cases, and that the
                    maximum imprisonment term of ten years was warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s giving of undue weight to the alleged mitigating
                factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, two of the mitigating factors which the Judge took
                    into account in sentencing the respondent were that: (a) the respondent had
                    committed the offence on the spur of the moment in a fit of uncontrolled anger;
                    and (b) the respondent had been a loving father to the Child. For the
                    reasons set out below, we agreed with the Prosecution that the Judge placed
                    undue weight on both of these alleged mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The submission that the respondent committed the offence on the spur
                of the moment in a fit of uncontrolled anger</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Dealing, first, with the submission by the
                    respondent that he had committed the offence on the spur of the moment in a fit
                    of uncontrolled anger, this excuse should not have been accepted by the Judge as
                    a mitigating factor as there was overwhelming evidence that at the material
                    time, the respondent still had considerable presence of mind and also retained
                    considerable control over his own actions. First, it will be recalled that upon
                    entering the Flat and seeing what the Child had done to his cigarettes, the
                    respondent shouted at her and thereafter <em>led her to the
                        kitchen to prevent neighbours from overhearing his shouting</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). This was hardly the behaviour
                    which one would expect from a person who had (supposedly) lost his head in a fit
                    of anger. On the contrary, this showed that the respondent was fully aware of
                    all the surrounding circumstances despite his anger at the Child. Second, in the
                    statement which he made to Assistant Superintendent David Ang
                    (“ASP Ang”) on 9 January 2009 (“the
                    9 January 2009 police statement”), the respondent stated that he had
                    made a <em>conscious and deliberate</em> decision to hit
                    the Child’s back rather than anywhere else on her body because, in his
                    view, the back was the strongest part of the body:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                    respondent admitted that he had actually had time to cool down in the course of
                    the Incident. In the 9 January 2009 police statement, the respondent
                    explained that there had been an interval during the Incident (which took place
                    in the kitchen of the Flat) when he had walked out to the living
                        room:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I slapped [the Child] on both cheeks three or four times while she was in
                        a standing position. [The Child] continued crying and sat on the floor. I
                        then punched her on her left upper arm three or four times. She continued
                        crying very loudly. After that, <em>I left her and went to

                            the cigarettes on the table in the living room, I went back to the
                            kitchen</em>. I squat down behind [the Child] and punched her on
                        the back of her body about four times. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the 13 January 2009 police statement,
                    the respondent revealed that he had gone to the living room of the Flat to cool

                        Child:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>

                            her back was facing me. I squat down and immediately punched
                        her.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This revelation was consistent with the statement made by the
                    respondent on 7 January 2009, where he admitted that after slapping the
                    Child and punching her on the arms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I walked into the [l]iving room to cool myself down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the light of what the respondent said as
                    set out above, what he did to the Child that fateful evening, contrary to the
                    Judge’s view, was <em>not</em> something done in a
                    moment of uncontrolled anger. Although the respondent might have been genuinely
                    angry that the Child had damaged and disarranged his cigarettes, he knew
                    precisely what he was doing when he beat her as he retained considerable control
                    over his own actions. He even had an interval during the Incident to cool down
                    before starting his second round of physical assault on the Child. The fact of
                    the matter was that the respondent let his anger get the better of him and
                    deliberately inflicted even greater injury on the Child. It is a matter of
                    common sense that when a parent or caregiver beats a child, the child’s
                    natural reaction would be to cry. To continue to beat a child while she is
                    crying and yet expect her to stop crying is totally senseless. In such a
                    situation (<em>ie</em>, where a child continues to be
                    beaten while she is crying), it may be that the child will only stop crying when
                    she is so severely injured that she can no longer cry. This was what happened in
                    the present case. It bears reiteration that the disciplining of a child must
                    always be measured, bearing in mind the age and the extent of understanding of
                    the child (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above). In our judgment,
                    and with respect, the Judge failed to give adequate consideration to the entire
                    sequence of events which took place that fateful evening, and consequently fell
                    into error in holding that the offence was committed by the respondent on the
                    spur of the moment in a fit of uncontrolled anger. In this regard, we would also
                    stress that anger should not be accepted as a mitigating factor in child abuse
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The submission that the respondent was a loving father who was
                remorseful for what he did</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Turning now to the second mitigating factor
                    highlighted at <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above (<em>viz</em>, that the respondent had been a loving father to the
                    Child and was remorseful for what he had done to her), we were of the view that
                    the Judge, in determining the appropriate sentence to impose, was unduly
                    sympathetic to the respondent in this regard. The Judge also placed undue
                    emphasis on the consideration that it would be forever imprinted on the
                    respondent’s conscience that he had unintentionally caused the death of
                    his own daughter (the Judge considered that that factor in itself would be
                    sufficient punishment for the respondent as he would have to endure this sense
                    of guilt for the rest of his life). It seemed to us totally unimaginable that a
                    truly loving father would inflict on his own child such severe injuries as the
                    ones suffered by the Child. The actions of the respondent at the material time
                    were fundamentally inconsistent with his claim to be a loving father to the
                    Child. On the contrary, his conduct showed him to be a wanton and temperamental
                    father who had no consideration at all for his helpless child; all that the
                    respondent wanted to do that fateful evening was to vent his anger on the
                    Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In this regard, it is significant that the
                    Judge found in the GD on conviction (at [19]) that there was evidence that the respondent had previously
                    been physically abusive towards the Child:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I should add that there was also evidence that [the respondent]
                        had been physically abusive towards the [Child]. F [the brother of [B]] gave
                        evidence of one occasion in late 2008 when [the respondent] and the [Child]
                        were at his home. F said that [the respondent] was playing on his PSP (a
                        computer game device) when the [Child] started crying. This caused [the
                        respondent] to become angry and he shouted at the [Child] to be quiet. He
                        then went up to her and <em>dragged her</em> into a
                        bedroom. F heard [the respondent] <em>slap</em> the
                        [Child] and he went to the bedroom to intervene. They got into an argument
                        over this and thereafter their relationship was strained. It is clear that
                        [the respondent] had a <em>tendency of physically abusing the

                    there were 22 scars on the Child at the time of her death. According to the
                    medical evidence, those scars ranged from a week old to a month old,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and appeared to have been caused by
                        <em>pinching</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and/or <em>multiple cigarette burns</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Those scars were not disclosed
                    by either the respondent or [B] to the police. If the respondent were
                    responsible for those scars, he would have committed further offences besides
                    the one he was charged with (such as the offence under s 5(1) of the CYPA
                    of ill-treating a child). On the other hand, if [B] were responsible for the
                    scars, then the respondent would also have been guilty of neglecting his duty to
                    prevent such abuse from happening: a loving father would naturally have
                    protected his child from such abuse. Either way, the respondent was not the

                    injuries. According to the medical evidence, those lacerations were fresh
                    injuries that had been inflicted less than 24 hours prior to the Child’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the evidence, it was highly unlikely that

                    constipation, given Dr [YR]’s evidence that there were no stools in

                    of [PD] Hospital on 6 January 2009 (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above). In a similar vein, [B]’s evidence was that

                    anal rim, then it appeared from the evidence that the lacerations had been
                    caused when <em>someone applied blunt force to force an object

                                            anus without actually penetrating … through the
                                            anus, then that might cause the abrasions and the
                                            laceration[s]. But the object has not actually
                                            penetrated into the anus. The reason … why an
                                            object that just impacts without actually penetrating is
                                            that if the object is relatively larger in diameter than
                                            the anus itself, the object, of course, would then not
                                            be able to enter the anus. But if some force is applied,
                                            it may stretch the skin and cause the laceration[s] on

                                            the tip of the object, if there was an object, had

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     From the medical evidence adduced at the
                    trial, it was manifestly clear that less than 24 hours before the Child’s
                    death, someone had forced (or attempted to force) a blunt object into the
                    Child’s anus, resulting in the injuries, which included bleeding at the
                    anus and radial lacerations of the anal rim. The evidence also revealed that one
                    of the possible objects which might have caused those injuries was the penis of
                    a man. The aforesaid injuries were clearly contemporaneous because when the
                    Child was seen at the emergency department of [PD] Hospital on 6 January
                    2009, her anus was oozing with blood (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>–<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above). It
                    was clear that both the respondent and [B] were less than truthful to the court
                    about the full extent of the Child’s injuries. As we noted at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above, neither the respondent nor [B]
                    disclosed to the police the radial lacerations found on the Child’s anal
                    rim, just as they did not disclose the 22 scars found on the Child. Although the
                    Judge did not make any determinative finding on whether the Child had been
                    sexually abused and, if so, by whom, we were of the view that in the face of
                    such clear and objective evidence of physical abuse (and possible sexual abuse),
                    it would not be appropriate to accept the respondent’s bald claim that he
                    had been a loving father to the Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is a trite sentencing principle that an
                    offender can only be punished for the offence(s) which he has been charged with
                    and convicted of. Similarly, it is a well-established sentencing principle that
                    the sentencing judge is precluded from taking into consideration facts relating
                    to charges which have been withdrawn or which have not been brought against the
                    accused (see <em>Knight Glenn Jeyasingam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 523 at [13], <em>Chua Tiong Tiong v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 515 at [28]–[29] and <em>Lim Pei Ni Charissa v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 31 at [19]). In the present case, given that no
                    charges relating to sexual abuse or earlier instances of physical abuse of the
                    Child were brought against the respondent, the evidence of the
                    respondent’s previous physical abuse and possible sexual abuse of the
                    Child could not be taken into account as an aggravating factor. However, such
                    evidence was certainly pertinent to the respondent’s plea in mitigation
                    that he had been a loving father to the Child. Justice demands that the
                    sentencing court should not and must not blindly accept alleged mitigating
                    factors which are plainly untrue in the face of the evidence before the court.
                    Such mitigating circumstances ought not to be given any consideration by the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the present case, there was irrefutable
                    evidence of prior physical abuse (and also possible sexual abuse) of the Child
                    by the respondent, which negated the latter’s self-serving assertion that
                    he had been a loving father to the Child. We should add that the fact that on
                    the day of the offence, the respondent thought of buying and did buy a doll for
                    the Child for her forthcoming birthday could not wipe out all the atrocious acts
                    which he committed against her on that fateful day as well as before that.
                    Whatever might have been the psychological explanation for that single act of
                    affection on the respondent’s part, the respondent could not by any
                    stretch of the imagination be considered a loving father to the Child as, on the
                    evidence, what he did to her that day was not a mere aberration. Instead, he had
                    been physically abusing the Child all along.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Here, we should allude to the fact that the
                    respondent’s father-in-law and mother-in-law thought that he had been a
                    loving father to the Child. Perhaps, they did not see the true side of him. In
                    contrast, there was the evidence of the respondent’s brother-in-law
                        (<em>ie</em>, the person referred to as
                    “F” at [19] of the GD on
                    conviction (reproduced at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above)), who
                    told the court that he had witnessed an incident in late-2008 when the
                    respondent had used violence on the Child by slapping her face and he (the
                    respondent’s brother-in-law) had intervened. What cannot be denied were
                    the injuries inflicted on the Child on that fateful day, as well as the 22 scars
                    and the radial lacerations of the anal rim found on her after she died. Further,
                    the fact that the respondent, upon being told on 6 January 2009 that the
                    Child had died, cried and collapsed onto the floor was not in any way indicative
                    of his alleged love for her. There are many possible explanations for the
                    respondent’s conduct at that time, not least his fears as to what might
                    befall him since he was the one who had caused the Child’s
                death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Before we conclude our discussion of the
                    alleged mitigating factors in the present case, we would allude to one other
                    factor raised by the respondent, which was not commented on by the Judge in the
                    GD on sentence. This relates to the respondent’s assertion that he had led
                    a relatively crime-free life prior to the Incident. In our view, this is a
                    severe understatement given the respondent’s antecedents from 1998 to
                    2004, which included convictions for robbery, the sale and distribution of
                    obscene films, the exhibition of uncensored films and desertion from his civil
                    defence liabilities. In addition, we also note from the psychiatric assessment
                    conducted by Senior Consultant Psychiatrist Dr [TY] that the respondent was
                    not of unsound mind at the time of the offence, and that his adaptive
                    functioning was good by general standards. In the result, we could see no
                    mitigating factors in the present case that could justify a sentence as light as
                    the one imposed by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For the aforesaid reasons, we found the
                    sentence imposed by the Judge manifestly inadequate. Accordingly, we enhanced
                    the respondent’s imprisonment term from six to ten years, backdated to
                    take effect from the date of the respondent’s arrest (<em>viz</em>, 6 January 2009). In addition, in view of the extreme
                    violence inflicted by the respondent on the Child (see <em>Chia
                        Kim Heng Frederick v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 63 at [18]), caning
                    was called for, having regard to the need for general and specific deterrence as
                    well as the principle of retributive justice. Thus, we imposed ten strokes of
                    the cane on the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Finally, given the young age of the
                    respondent’s other two children, [C] and [D], we requested the Prosecution
                    to alert the appropriate welfare services to ensure that these two
                    children’s interests would be taken care of, both during the
                    respondent’s imprisonment and after his release from prison.</p>
