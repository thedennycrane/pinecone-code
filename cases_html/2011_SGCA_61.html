        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These were two appeals against the decision of
                    the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Hiap Seng
                        &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Lau Chin Hu and others</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 143 (“the GD”). The respondent in both
                    appeals was Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The
                    appellant in Civil Appeal No 223 of 2010 was Lew Kiat Beng
                    (“LKB”), and the appellants in Civil Appeal No 225 of 2010
                    were Lau Chin Hu (“LCH”) and Law Chin Chai (“LCC”).
                    All three appellants are collectively referred to as “the
                    Appellants” in these grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellants were shareholders and directors
                    of the Company and were also the defendants in Suit No 133 of 2010
                    (“the Derivative Action”), which was a derivative action brought
                    pursuant to leave granted under s 216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”). These appeals arose from an
                    interlocutory application made by the Company in the Derivative
                Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 20 March 2008, two other shareholders
                    and directors of the Company, Law Chin Eng and Lau Chin Whatt (collectively,
                    “LCE &amp; LCW”), filed Originating Summons No 372 of 2008
                    (“OS 372/2008”) to apply for leave under s 216A of the
                    CA to bring a derivative action in the name of the Company against the
                    Appellants. LCE &amp; LCW alleged that the Appellants had breached their
                    fiduciary duties to the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 30 September 2009, LCE &amp; LCW were
                    granted leave to commence a derivative action against the Appellants for some
                    alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. LCE &amp; LCW were authorised to control
                    the conduct of the action and any execution proceedings thereafter (see
                        <em>Law Chin Eng and Another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd
                        (Lau Chin Hu and others, applicants)</em> [2009] SGHC 223 at
                        [42]). An appeal against the order
                    granting leave was dismissed. Subsequently, LCE &amp; LCW commenced the
                    Derivative Action by filing a Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim on behalf
                    of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the making of the Judge’s order on
                discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After the close of pleadings, an Assistant
                    Registrar directed on 26 August 2010 that the parties were to file and
                    exchange their respective Lists of Documents and affidavits verifying the same
                    by 16 September 2010 under O 24 r 1 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). Despite being
                    directors of the Company, LCE &amp; LCW had no access to its office premises as
                    they were not involved in its operations. Hence, their solicitors wrote to the
                    Appellants on 27 August 2010 and asked the Appellants to procure documents
                    of the Company which were relevant to matters in the Derivative Action for LCE
                    &amp; LCW to inspect at the Company’s premises, so that LCE &amp; LCW
                    could file a List of Documents on behalf of the Company. LKB’s solicitors
                    responded on 30 August 2010, stating that LKB would not accede to LCE &amp;
                    LCW’s request. LCW affirmed that when LCW &amp; LCE turned up at the
                    Company’s office on 31 August 2010, they were refused
                entry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 1 September 2010, LCE &amp; LCW filed
                    Summons No 4129 of 2010 (“the Application”) in the Derivative
                    Action. In his affidavit filed for the purposes of the Application, LCW stated
                    that it was necessary for LCE &amp; LCW to have access to and to inspect the
                    Company’s documents that were relevant to the Derivative Action in order
                    for them to fulfil the Company’s discovery obligations. In his affidavit,
                    LCW also relied on his right as a director to inspect the accounting and other
                    records of the Company under s 199(3) of the CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Assistant Registrar dismissed the
                    Application on 23 September 2010. The Company’s appeal was heard and
                    allowed by the Judge on 10 November 2010. The order that was made by the
                    Judge (“the Order”) obliged the Appellants to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     give LCE &amp; LCW and their
                        solicitors and/or other representatives access to the Company’s
                        premises or such other place where the Company’s records might be kept
                        for them to inspect and take copies of: (i) the Company’s
                        documents which explained the transactions and financial position of the
                        Company, and (ii) the Company’s documents which were relevant to
                        matters raised in the Statement of Claim; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     release and/or give LCE &amp; LCW access to
                        “such documents which [the Appellants] ha[d] within their possession,
                        custody or power, which [were] documents belonging to [the Company] or which
                        ought to be documents within the possession, custody or power of [the
                        Company]” in relation to matters raised in the Statement of
                        Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The documents described in the Order are
                    henceforth referred to as “the Requested Documents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the Order was made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Pursuant to the Order, LCE &amp; LCW inspected
                    the Requested Documents at the premises of LKB’s solicitors on
                    23 November 2010. LKB’s solicitors then wrote to LCE &amp;
                    LCW’s solicitors on 26 November 2010 enclosing a list of the
                    documents which were inspected by LCE &amp; LCW. In that letter, LKB also sought
                    confirmation of whether LCE &amp; LCW required any other documents in relation
                    to the Order. LCH and LCC took positions similar to LKB’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       LCE &amp; LCW’s solicitors replied by
                    letter on 2 December 2010, claiming that the Appellants had been deficient
                    in complying with the Order, and alleging that there were numerous documents
                    which fell within the scope of the Order but which were not produced during the
                    inspection on 23 November 2010. LCE &amp; LCW’s solicitors listed
                    examples of documents which they alleged the Appellants had
                    “suppressed”, “deliberately withheld”,
                    “unilaterally filtered”, “selectively extracted” and
                    “deliberately sanitised”. The letter of 2 December 2010 from
                    LCE &amp; LCW’s solicitors concluded sternly with a “demand that
                    [LKB] comply with the Order and furnish all other documents that have not been
                    furnished but which ought to have been so furnished under the Order <u>forthwith</u>” [underlining in
                original].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellants were initially willing to
                    proceed to conduct discovery in the Derivative Action and to forgo these appeals
                    on the correctness of the Order. However, they were aggrieved by what they saw
                    as unwarranted allegations made against them and the spectre of contempt
                    proceedings since LCE &amp; LCW refused to confirm that the Order had been fully
                    complied with. Hence, they filed these appeals on 10 December 2010 to set
                    aside the Order. That was insufficient to prevent LCE &amp; LCW’s
                    solicitors from persisting in their threats and allegations, resulting in the
                    Appellants having to apply for a stay of execution on the Order, which stay they
                    obtained on 6 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The parties eventually filed their respective
                    Lists of Documents and affidavits verifying the same on 15 April 2011. But,
                    they continued their acrimonious exchanges from 20 April 2011 to
                    17 June 2011, which created much heat but no light. The letters issuing
                    from LCE &amp; LCW’s solicitors were consistently impolite and created
                    unnecessary acrimony even at the interlocutory stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Against the backdrop of the discovery process
                    which had begun and the Order (the execution of which had been stayed), the
                    parties’ solicitors continued to dispute: (a) whether the Appellants
                    had provided all of the Requested Documents to LCE &amp; LCW; (b) the
                    proper treatment of the documents that were discovered pursuant to the Order;
                    and (c) whether the Order, which had not specified any timelines for its
                    completion, was still in force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Because the Lists of Documents had already
                    been filed in general discovery, it should have been apparent to the solicitors
                    for LCE &amp; LCW that the quickest and simplest step to take was to seek
                    specific discovery under O 24 r 5 of the ROC if they considered that
                    certain documents that ought to have been disclosed by the Appellants, pursuant
                    to the Appellants’ discovery obligations, had not been disclosed. However,
                    no application for specific discovery was taken out by LCE &amp; LCW. The
                    Appellants’ solicitors, on the other hand, became confused about LCE &amp;
                    LCW’s legal basis for making continual demands on the Appellants for
                    production of the allegedly suppressed documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The correspondence exchanged between the
                    parties after general discovery reflected three points. First, it demonstrated
                    that the nature and scope of the Order produced an inefficient and
                    unsatisfactory discovery process. The parties were compelled to deal with two
                    criss-crossing procedural tracks aimed at surfacing the same relevant documents.
                    One track originated from the Order, which did not provide any means to
                    determine whether it had been complied with or had ceased to have effect. The
                    second track sprang from the usual discovery process under O 24 of the ROC
                    and required the Appellants, as the Company’s directors, to disclose the
                    very same documents. Secondly, the correspondence between the parties revealed
                    that it was undisputed that it was the Appellants who had possession, custody or
                    power over the Requested Documents. Thirdly, the said correspondence confirmed
                    that the Application was, from the outset, not necessary for the proper conduct
                    of the Derivative Action because all that LCE &amp; LCW had to do, after filing
                    their List of Documents, was to avail themselves of the specific discovery
                    mechanism to seek from the Appellants any documents allegedly missing from the
                    Requested Documents, which missing documents the Appellants would then have to
                    include in a supplementary List of Documents. This point was also established at
                    the hearing of the present appeals, where counsel for the parties were asked
                    whether they needed any consequential orders to be made if the Order was set
                    aside, and none of them thought that was necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge considered the two grounds which LCE
                    &amp; LCW had relied on to make the Application – first, that it was
                    necessary for LCE &amp; LCW to have access to and to inspect the Requested
                    Documents in order for the Company to fulfil its discovery obligations in the
                    Derivative Action; and secondly, that LCE &amp; LCW were entitled, <em>qua</em> directors of the Company, to inspect the Requested
                    Documents under s 199(3) of the CA because they were also company documents
                    (see the GD at [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Order was granted on neither of these
                    grounds. The Judge disposed of the latter ground swiftly, stating that LCE &amp;
                    LCW’s reliance on s 199(3) of the CA was misplaced since they were
                    not seeking access to the Requested Documents “for themselves <em>qua</em> directors” (see the GD at [10]). The Judge was right, and we affirmed
                    this decision. We should add that the Application was also procedurally wrong in
                    so far as it was based on s 199(3) of the CA. An application under
                    s 199(3) of the CA falls within the ambit of O 88 r 2(1) of the
                    ROC, and must be brought by way of an originating summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s reasons for making the Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     To decide whether or not to grant the Order,
                    the Judge formulated the issues as follows (at [1] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     what was the right of a party having
                        control of the conduct of a derivative action to the company’s
                        documents; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     what was the duty of the parties having possession and control of the
                        relevant company documents in terms of giving the party having control of
                        the conduct of the derivative action access to those
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge provided two grounds for making the
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Right of LCE &amp; LCW as the parties conducting the Derivative
                Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, the Judge considered that because LCE
                    &amp; LCW controlled the conduct of the Derivative Action, they also owed a duty
                    to ensure that the Derivative Action was prosecuted properly and diligently. He
                    explained what such a duty entailed (at [11] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Towards that end, it is necessary for [LCE &amp; LCW] to review
                        all the documents relevant to the action so that the best case can be
                        pleaded and presented on behalf of [the Company]. The duty is not confined
                        to reviewing documents in [LCE &amp; LCW’s] possession, and extends to
                        [the Company’s] documents which are not in their possession. [LCE
                        &amp; LCW] would be in dereliction of their duty if they neglected to have
                        access to such documents and to review them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In our view, whilst it was true that LCE &amp;
                    LCW needed the Requested Documents in order to prosecute the Derivative Action
                    properly and diligently, they did not need to have access to the Requested
                    Documents at that point in time. LCE &amp; LCW was already in possession of
                    sufficient evidence to establish a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case for the purposes of OS 372/2008 (<em>viz</em>,
                    the application for leave to commence a derivative action) and then to file a
                    particularised Statement of Claim in the Derivative Action. If the right to have
                    access to the Requested Documents was intended to enable them to “plead
                    and present” a case, that was not required. If the right was meant to
                    allow them to plead and present the “<em>best</em>
                    case” [emphasis added], that was also not needed. LCE &amp; LCW could
                    simply amend the Statement of Claim after discovery to take into account any
                    evidence disclosed by the Appellants which they had yet to consider. No
                    prejudice would be suffered by the Company because the documents which the
                    Appellants would have to disclose in the course of discovery would necessarily
                    include the Requested Documents as defined by the Application and the
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duty of the Appellants as directors of the Company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, the Judge held that the Appellants,
                    as directors of the Company, were under a particular duty to act in the
                    interests of the Company, and, to that end, must allow LCE &amp; LCW to have
                    access to the Company’s documents. The duty was described in this way (at
                        [12] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The Appellants] must recognise [LCE &amp; LCW’s] right to
                        pursue the action on behalf of [the Company]. If there are such documents in
                        their possession and control as directors of [the Company], then [the
                        Appellants] must allow [LCE &amp; LCW] to have access to the documents.
                        … [The Appellants] cannot withhold the relevant documents of [the
                        Company] from [LCE &amp; LCW] who have control of the case on behalf of [the
                        Company], and their refusal to give access was, <em>prima
                            facie</em>, a breach of their directors’ duties to act in
                        the interests of [the Company], and that includes giving assistance to [the
                        Company] to prosecute the action effectively, and not to hinder its
                        efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We disagreed that such a duty existed
                        <em>at that stage of the proceedings</em>. With
                    respect, the Judge’s reasoning overlooked the fact that while the
                    Appellants were the Company’s directors, they were also defendants who
                    were being sued as directors of the Company. Hence, their conduct at the
                    interlocutory stage was already and should continue to be governed by what
                    ordinary civil procedure required a defendant to do at the pre-trial
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As defendants to the Derivative Action, the
                    Appellants were under no obligation to provide any documents to the plaintiff
                        (<em>viz</em>, the Company) until general discovery was
                    ordered. Since it was undisputed that the Appellants had possession, custody or
                    power over the Requested Documents, it should have been understood by all
                    parties that the Appellants would disclose them in the course of the discovery
                    process. In fact, the Appellants did disclose the Requested Documents on
                    15 April 2011 and 14 June 2011 in their respective Lists of Documents
                    and affirmed affidavits verifying the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     To require the Appellants to provide LCE &amp;
                    LCW with relevant company documents prior to discovery by virtue of their
                    directorships was not only onerous, but also unfair in the context of the suit
                    against them (<em>viz</em>, the Derivative Action) for
                    alleged breaches of their duties as directors. Therefore, we did not accept
                    either of the Judge’s reasons for granting the Application. The GD did not
                    evaluate the issue of whether the Order was required to enable LCE &amp; LCW to
                    fulfil the Company’s discovery obligations. We considered that a relevant
                    issue and we will address it below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Regularity of the Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Apart from the two grounds stated by the Judge
                    for making the Order, in relation to the regularity of the Application, the
                    Judge emphasised that the Application was made in the context of or pursuant to
                    the leave granted in OS 372/2008 to institute the Derivative Action, and
                    that the right of access to the relevant documents of the Company flowed from
                    the authority to institute the Derivative Action (see the GD at [13] and [18]). Thus, he was of the view that it was procedurally proper
                    that the Application was made by a summons as part of the Derivative Action,
                    which was ongoing, and that the court had the power to grant the Application.
                    This reasoning assumed that the outcome of an application for leave to commence
                    a derivative action would continue to control or influence how the subsequent
                    derivative action was conducted. However, the nature and extent of this control
                    or influence was not articulated by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In view of the foregoing, there were two
                    issues that this court had to consider in these appeals: whether the court had
                    the power to grant the Application in the Derivative Action; and whether the
                    Order was necessary to enable LCE &amp; LCW to satisfy the Company’s
                    discovery obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the court have the power to grant the Application in the
                Derivative Action?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our view, whether the court had the power
                    to grant the Application in the Derivative Action depended on the relationship
                    between a leave application under s 216A of the CA and the ensuing
                    derivative suit. In Canada, the courts have heard applications under the
                    relevant Canadian legislation made by a derivative plaintiff, who has been
                    granted control of the conduct of a derivative action, for access to the
                    plaintiff company’s documents or other information. Those applications
                    were also made as part of the derivative action (see <em>Discovery Enterprises Inc v Ebco Industries Ltd</em> (2001)
                    86 BCLR (3d) 120 (“<em>Discovery
                        Enterprises</em>”) and <em>345457 BC Ltd v Brian
                        A Tieszen and others</em> [2001] BCSC 26
                        (“<em>Tieszen</em>”)). Counsel for LCE
                    &amp; LCW relied on these two Canadian authorities to justify the correctness of
                    the Order (discussed below at [34]–[36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, the relevant provisions in the
                    applicable companies legislation of Canada and Singapore are different.
                        Section 233(3)(<em>a</em>) of the Business
                    Corporations Act 2002 (c 57) (BC) (“s 233(3)(<em>a</em>) BCBCA”) (which is identical in wording to its
                    predecessor legislation, s 201(4) of the Company Act 1996 (c 62) (BC)
                    (“Company Act 1996”), the applicable statute in <em>Discovery Enterprises</em> and <em>Tieszen</em>)
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    While an action
                            brought or defended under this section is pending, the Court
                        may,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    on the
                                application of a member or director, authorize any person to control
                                the conduct of the action or give any other directions for the
                                conduct of the action …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the other hand, s 216A(5) of the CA
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In granting leave under this section, the Court may make such
                        orders or interim orders as it thinks fit in the interests of justice,
                        including (but not limited to) the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    an order
                                authorising the complainant or any other person to control the
                                conduct of the action;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    an order giving
                                directions for the conduct of the action;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is a material difference between the two provisions.
                    Under s 216A(5) of the CA, our courts are limited to making an order giving
                    directions for the conduct of the action “[i]n granting leave”
                    under s 216A. The plain wording of the statute means that after leave has
                    been granted, the Singapore courts can no longer give such directions. On the
                    other hand, s 233(3)(<em>a</em>) BCBCA provides for
                    greater flexibility and the Canadian courts are able to continue giving
                    directions for the conduct of a derivative action while the derivative action is
                    “pending”, that is, after leave has been granted. The
                    interlocutory applications that were made in the substantive actions themselves
                    in the Canadian authorities cited by LCE &amp; LCW were therefore unexceptional
                    in the context of Canadian legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, what LCE &amp; LCW sought
                    in the Application were arguably “directions for the conduct of the
                    action”, which fell under s 216A(5)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the CA. The court, “[i]n granting leave” in OS 372/2008,
                    could have directed the intended defendants in the prospective derivative action
                    to hand over the Requested Documents to the successful complainants (if they had
                    known what those documents were). Here, the court did not give any such
                    directions because LCE &amp; LCW did not ask for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, the failure to seek the court’s
                    directions concerning the Requested Documents at that stage of the proceedings
                    (assuming that directions were needed) would not be fatal because the phrase
                    “control [of] the conduct of the action” in
                        s 216A(5)(<em>a</em>) of the CA should be
                    construed purposively. Hence, a derivative plaintiff, armed with a leave order,
                    would nevertheless be entitled to do whatever was necessary for the derivative
                    action to be brought in a fair manner for adjudication by the court at a trial,
                    whether or not there were specific directions in the leave order to that effect.
                    The threshold must be one of “necessity” because any less
                    stringent standard would render s 216A(5)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the CA otiose. Hence, the court below had the power to hear the Application
                    and grant it since it was properly brought by LCE &amp; LCW, as empowered by the
                    court’s leave order in OS 372/2008 (see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), in relation to the conduct of the Derivative
                    Action. However, the Application should have been granted only if it was
                    necessary in order for LCE &amp; LCW to conduct the Derivative Action in a fair
                    manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the Order needed to enable LCE &amp; LCW to satisfy the
                Company’s discovery obligations?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For LCE &amp; LCW to conduct the Derivative
                    Action fairly, they must satisfy the Company’s pre-trial obligations, one
                    of which was its discovery obligations <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the Appellants. Accordingly, LCE &amp; LCW contended that the Order was needed
                    so that the Company could fulfil its discovery obligations. The validity of
                    their argument depended on the scope of the Company’s discovery
                    obligations. We held that the Company’s discovery obligations did not
                    extend to disclosing the Requested Documents which were not in the possession,
                    custody or power of LCE &amp; LCW. The irony in cases of this nature is that
                    only the defendant director (in this case, the Appellants) would have full
                    knowledge of the documents or other information relevant to the derivative
                    action. Therefore, until the court was made aware of what documents the
                    Appellants had in their possession, it could not and should not have made the
                    Order in the form and the substance which it did. As a result, the Judge made an
                    Order which was not only unnecessary, but also couched in such wide terms that
                    it created the serious problems which we have outlined above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>–<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The scope of a plaintiff company’s discovery
                obligations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Order 24 r 1(1) of the ROC
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to this Rule and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time order
                        any party to a cause or matter (whether begun by writ, originating summons
                        or otherwise) to give discovery by making and serving on any other party a
                        list of the documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or
                        power, and may at the same time or subsequently also order him to make and
                        file an affidavit verifying such a list to serve a copy thereof on the other
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no provision in the ROC which applies specifically to the
                    conduct of derivative actions. The terms “any party”, “any
                    other party” and “the other party” in the context of a
                    derivative action would appear to contemplate only the plaintiff company and the
                    defendants. However, there is nothing in the ROC to preclude the court from
                    taking into consideration the status of the person who has control of the
                    conduct of the derivative action (the <em>de facto</em>
                    (derivative) plaintiff, who will hereafter be referred to as the
                        “<em>de facto</em> plaintiff”) when
                    delineating the scope of the discovery obligations of the plaintiff company (the
                        “<em>de jure</em>
                plaintiff”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Indeed, it is our view that the scope of the
                    plaintiff company’s discovery obligations in a derivative action should be
                    determined by two factors. First, the litigation status of both the <em>de facto</em> plaintiff and the defendant should be taken
                    into account. Secondly, any directions made by the court under
                        s 216A(5)(<em>b</em>) of the CA in granting leave
                    to commence the derivative action must be considered. Since no relevant
                    directions were given at the leave stage in this case, only the first factor
                    will be discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of the status of the de facto plaintiff and the
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In Canada, the nature of a derivative action
                    has been considered by the courts. The cases cited to us show that the Canadian
                    judges have regard to the status of the <em>de facto</em>
                    plaintiff and the defendant in determining the rights and obligations of the
                    various parties during the pre-trial phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     
          <em>Discovery
                        Enterprises</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>) was a case which considered the rights of a <em>de facto</em> plaintiff in the pre-trial context. A
                    shareholder (“Discovery”) had obtained leave to sue the
                    company’s directors (“the Eppiches”) on behalf of the
                    company (“Ebco”). In the derivative action, Discovery applied, in
                    the name of and on behalf of Ebco, for orders permitting it to conduct
                    examinations for discovery of, amongst others, a representative of Ebco under
                    r 27(3) of the then-existing Supreme Court Rules 1990 (Reg 221/90)
                    (BC) (“Supreme Court Rules”). The Eppiches opposed
                    Discovery’s application to examine a representative of Ebco.
                    Rule 27(3) of the Supreme Court Rules stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party to an action may examine for discovery any party adverse in
                        interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In that case (at [35]),
                    Pitfield J agreed with the Eppiches that r 27(3) did not entitle
                    Discovery, the <em>de facto</em> plaintiff, to examine
                    anyone because it was not “a party to the action”. However,
                    Pitfield J also asked himself whether such a result promoted the ends of
                    justice, or whether some other result was permitted, having regard to other
                    provisions of the Company Act 1996 (see above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). He overcame any disadvantage to Discovery by allowing
                    counsel for Discovery, who was acting in Ebco’s name, to examine the
                    Eppiches for the purpose of the derivative action, and by also allowing the
                    Eppiches to examine Ebco’s representatives for the purpose of defending
                    the derivative action. Such directions ensured that Discovery would suffer
                    little disadvantage in the derivative action from Discovery not being allowed to
                    examine the Eppiches. The interpretation in <em>Discovery
                        Enterprises</em> could not be applied here because it concerned a very
                    different provision, and because that case was about the right of a <em>de facto</em> plaintiff, whereas in the present appeals, we
                    were concerned with the obligation of a <em>de jure</em>
                    plaintiff. In our view, the importance of <em>Discovery
                        Enterprises</em> lay, instead, in the pragmatic approach which
                    Pitfield J took in resolving the issue. The overriding concern there was
                    that the pre-trial procedures must be performed in a way which promoted the ends
                    of civil justice, that is, they must enable the parties to prosecute and defend
                    the claim fairly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     
          <em>Discovery
                        Enterprises</em> was also different from the present case because
                    there, the board of directors of the <em>de jure</em>
                    plaintiff had a disinterested segment which could represent the <em>de jure</em> plaintiff’s distinct interests in the
                    litigation. In the subsequent case of <em>Tieszen</em> (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), there were only two opposing
                    camps because the dissolved plaintiff company (“Sunrich”) was
                    restored to the register of companies only for the purpose of enabling one of
                    its shareholders (“Shinil Park”) to bring a derivative action
                    against another shareholder (“BT Foods”). Shinil Park applied for
                    the discovery of Sunrich’s files which were held by BT Foods’
                    solicitors. BT Foods resisted the application on the basis that the said files
                    were protected by solicitor-client privilege. The judge held that Shinil Park
                    was entitled to review Sunrich’s files on behalf of Sunrich.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     
          <em>Tieszen</em> must be
                    distinguished, however, as it was concerned with the different issue of whether
                    Shinil Park could have access to the relevant documents of Sunrich at all, and
                    not when or why he should have them. The purpose of Shinil Park seeking access
                    was not about fulfilling any discovery obligations on behalf of Sunrich. BT
                    Foods resisted the application not because they were willing to provide the
                    documents to Shinil Park at a later time via discovery, but because the
                    documents were allegedly privileged. The judge held that:
                    (a) Sunrich’s solicitor-client privilege was not for BT Foods, a
                    shareholder, to exercise; and (b) given that Sunrich had been restored to
                    the register purely for Shinil Park to bring a derivative action in its name,
                    Shinil Park must be entitled to the documents of Sunrich.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Company’s discovery obligations in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the present appeals, we adopted the
                    pragmatic approach applied by the Canadian courts in delineating a
                    company’s pre-trial obligations in a derivative action. In the context of
                    discovery, this approach meant that although the Company was the <em>de jure</em> plaintiff in the Derivative Action and was
                        <em>prima facie</em> “a party to a cause”
                    under O 24 of the ROC, its discovery obligations must reflect the fact that
                    there were only two sets of antagonistic shareholder-directors in the Company
                    – LCE &amp; LCW on the one hand, and the Appellants on the other. There
                    were no disinterested shareholders or directors involved. Hence, it was only
                    commonsensical that the Requested Documents must be in the possession, custody
                    or power of either one or both camps. Naturally, since LCE &amp; LCW did not
                    have the Requested Documents, they must be with the Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Therefore, the Company, acting through LCE
                    &amp; LCW, should not and was not obliged to disclose the Requested Documents in
                    the Derivative Action, even though they might belong to the Company. It was held
                    by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Re Tecnion Investments
                        Ltd</em> [1985] BCLC 434 that even a director with dominant
                    control and a majority shareholding may not <em>per se</em>
                    have power over some company documents and therefore need not disclose them in
                    discovery in an action against him. LCE &amp; LCW were in an even less important
                    position than the directors in <em>Re Tecnion Investments
                        Ltd</em> because they were neither directors involved in the
                    Company’s operations nor its majority shareholders. To require LCE &amp;
                    LCW to disclose the Requested Documents as part of the Company’s discovery
                    obligations would be excessive and unnecessary for the fair conduct of the
                    Derivative Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The fact that LCE &amp; LCW were acting on
                    behalf of the Company instead of in their personal capacities did not bring
                    about a material difference to their discovery obligations. A situation where
                    the company itself (despite being the <em>de jure</em>
                    plaintiff) does not have relevant documents of its own in its possession,
                    custody or power for the purposes of disclosing them as a party to a derivative
                    action is not uncommon. In those situations, third-party discovery can be sought
                    if the company documents are necessary for the fair disposal of the derivative
                    action. Alternatively, the company can file an affidavit stating what has
                    happened to those documents. In the present case, LCE &amp; LCW simply needed to
                    state, either at the time when the court gave orders for discovery or in their
                    List of Documents filed on behalf of the Company, that the Requested Documents
                    were in the Appellants’ possession, custody or power, and wait for the
                    Appellants to disclose them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on the right of a <em>de facto</em>
                plaintiff to disclosure of company documents </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Such right should not be over-extensive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The <em>de facto</em>
                    plaintiff who has control of the conduct of the derivative action must have
                    access to the relevant company documents to prosecute the action. But, this
                    right of access must not be over-extensive; otherwise, confusion and excesses
                    resulting in inefficiency will result, as happened in this case. The civil
                    justice system already has in place a mechanism for the <em>de
                        facto</em> plaintiff to receive relevant company documents at an
                    appropriate time and forum, regardless of: (a) whether or not the documents
                    are owned by the <em>de jure</em> plaintiff, and
                    (b) whether or not they are in the possession of the defendants. It comes
                    in the form of O 24 of the ROC. We further agreed with the observation of
                    Collins MR in <em>James Nelson &amp; Sons, Limited v Nelson
                        Line (Liverpool), Limited</em> [1906] 2 KB 217 (at 222) that
                    the whole matter of discovery has been the subject of special legislation,
                        <em>viz</em>, the ROC, and we are limited by its
                    express provisions. On a purposive reading of those provisions, there was no
                    lacuna in the law which had to be filled in order to promote the ends of civil
                    justice in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A court order made pursuant to s 216A of
                    the CA that certain complainants are to have control of the conduct of a
                    derivative action does not and ought not, without more, entitle the <em>de facto</em> plaintiffs to have, for the purposes of filing
                    a List of Documents on behalf of the company, access to relevant company
                    documents which they do not already have. It is neither necessary nor desirable
                    to imply that <em>de facto</em> plaintiffs, who are usually
                    shareholders, have to disclose, on behalf of the <em>de
                        jure</em> plaintiff, relevant company documents which are not in their
                    possession, custody or power when the very same documents have to be disclosed
                    by the defendant directors pursuant to their discovery obligations. The
                        <em>de jure</em> plaintiff’s discovery obligation
                    should correspond, as far as practicable, to relevant company documents which
                    are already in the <em>de facto</em> plaintiff’s
                    existing possession, custody or power. This division of burdens in the discovery
                    context is fair, efficient and clear to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The de facto plaintiff does not own the company’s
                documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Lastly, we would add, for completeness, that a
                        <em>de facto</em> plaintiff’s right of access to
                    company documents which are relevant to a derivative action cannot be based on
                    his ownership of those documents because he does not own them. When granted the
                    right to conduct a derivative action, the <em>de facto</em>
                    plaintiff, who is usually a shareholder, does not become the owner of the
                    company’s documents. Even in the usual course of business where a director
                    manages a company, he does not own any of the company’s documents, but
                    merely has access to them for the purpose of managing the company. If such a
                    director is denied access to company documents for that purpose, he must rely on
                    his separate statutory right to seek access to those documents, and cannot do so
                    by claiming to exercise any ownership right of the company. There is no
                    justification to identify a <em>de facto</em> plaintiff as
                    the company, and therefore capable of exercising its ownership rights over its
                    documents, when he is merely acting on behalf of the company for a particular
                    purpose, similar to how a director ordinarily acts on behalf of a
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Conversely, there are good commercial and
                    legal reasons why a right of access to company documents should not be elevated
                    to the right of ownership in a derivative action. The typical <em>de facto</em> plaintiff is a shareholder who usually has no right of
                    access to the company’s documents. The court should therefore be wary of
                    granting such access to the <em>de facto</em> plaintiff by
                    making an order on such extensive terms as the Order (see above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), which appeared to be premised on identifying
                    the <em>de facto</em> plaintiffs (<em>viz</em>, LCE &amp; LCW) as or equating them with the Company. The
                    safeguards provided in the Order were also not feasible. Although the Order
                    limited LCE &amp; LCW to having access to documents that were relevant to the
                    matters raised in the Derivative Action, this stipulation was insufficient to
                    prevent the execution of the Order from morphing into a search order in
                    practical terms. It cannot be doubted that the right of access to relevant
                    company documents is essential for a <em>de facto</em>
                    plaintiff to conduct a derivative action, but such right can be adequately
                    effectuated through the existing discovery mechanism provided by the
                ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the light of the above reasons, we allowed
                    both appeals with the usual consequential orders. The costs here and below were
                    awarded to the Appellants in any event.</p>
