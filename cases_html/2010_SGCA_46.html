<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the appellant, JBE
                    Properties Pte Ltd (“JBE”), against the decision of the High Court
                    judge (“the Judge”) to grant an interim injunction restraining JBE
                    from receiving any money under a performance bond numbered
                    “00001BGG0601600” (“the Bond”) on the ground that
                    JBE’s call on the Bond was unconscionable. The Judge’s decision is
                    reported in <em>Gammon Pte Ltd v JBE Properties Pte Ltd (SCDA
                        Architects Pte Ltd, third party)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 799
                    (“the GD”). After hearing the parties, we dismissed JBE’s
                    appeal against the grant of the aforesaid interim injunction (“the
                    Interim Injunction”), but set aside certain ancillary orders made by the
                    Judge (“the Ancillary Orders”). We now give the reasons for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The background to the present proceedings is as
                    follows. JBE is the developer of an eight-storey residential building at Handy
                    Road, Singapore (“the Building”). JBE awarded the construction of
                    the Building to the respondent, Gammon Pte Limited (“Gammon”), on
                    19 January 2006. On 3 August 2006, JBE and Gammon entered into a
                    building contract (“the Building Contract”). The value of the
                    Building Contract was $11,515,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There were various defects in the construction
                    of the Building, and it was in respect of the alleged cost of rectifying some of
                    these defects that JBE made a call on the Bond. Gammon then applied (via Summons
                    No 1224 of 2009 (“SUM 1224/2009”)) for an interim
                    injunction to restrain JBE from receiving any payment under the Bond from the
                    issuing bank, BNP Paribas Singapore (“the Bank”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the court below, Gammon argued that the Bond
                    was not an on-demand performance bond, but was instead an indemnity performance
                    bond, and, thus, payment under it could only be made upon proof of loss, and not
                    at this interim stage of the proceedings when its (Gammon’s) alleged
                    liability for failing to rectify construction defects had yet to be determined.
                    JBE, in contrast, contended that the Bond was an on-demand performance bond. The
                    Judge decided (at [5] of the GD) that the Bond was an on-demand performance
                    bond, and proceeded to consider whether JBE should be restrained from receiving
                    payment thereunder on the grounds of either fraud or unconscionability, the two
                    established grounds under Singapore law for restraining the receipt of payment
                    made under a performance bond (or, as is commonly said, for restraining a call
                    on a performance bond). He held that Gammon had shown “a strong <em>prima facie</em> case of unconscionability” (see the
                    GD at [10]) and, accordingly, granted Gammon the Interim Injunction. He also
                    made the Ancillary Orders, which were set out in the GD (at sub-paras (b)
                    and (c) of [17]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    All rectification works to be completed by
                            [Gammon] within six months. Inspection of rectification work[s] to be
                            carried out in the month of October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Any dispute on the quality of the rectification
                            works in accordance with the warranty will be determined by the court.
                            If the court determines that the rectification works in accordance with
                            the standard set out in the warranty is not satisfied, the court may
                            direct that, subject to [a] call on the [B]ond, a joint tender be
                            carried out in order to rectify the balance of the unrectified defects
                            as determined by the court. The completion of the balance of [the]
                            rectification works, through the joint tender, shall be deemed to be in
                            accordance with the standard set out in the warranty. The specifications
                            for the contractors for the joint tender … shall be the original
                            specifications for the works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The matters considered in the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On appeal, Gammon did not pursue its argument
                    that the Bond was not an on-demand performance bond (in this regard, before this
                    court, JBE maintained its position that the Bond was an on-demand performance
                    bond). Thus, strictly speaking, the only question which we had to decide in the
                    present appeal was whether the Judge was right to grant the Interim Injunction
                    on the ground of unconscionability. Nevertheless, as the issue of the nature of
                    the Bond (<em>viz</em>, whether it was an on-demand
                    performance bond or an indemnity performance bond) was of considerable
                    importance to the construction industry, we raised it with counsel during the
                    hearing of the appeal, and we propose to make some observations on it in these
                    grounds of decision. Before we do so, however, we wish to first reiterate a
                    crucial difference between our law and English law <em>vis-à-vis</em> the circumstances in which the court may restrain a
                    call on a performance bond. For ease of discussion, we shall hereafter (where
                    appropriate) use the term “beneficiary” to refer to the party in
                    whose favour a performance bond or a letter of credit is issued, the term
                    “obligor” to refer to the party upon whose instructions a
                    performance bond or a letter of credit is issued, and the term “paying
                    bank” to refer to the bank (whether it be the issuing bank or the
                    confirming bank) which is required to make payment under a performance bond or a
                    letter of credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law as to when the court may restrain a call on a performance
                bond</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It is now well established that, under our law,
                    apart from fraud (which is the traditional ground for restraining a call on a
                    performance bond), unconscionability is a <em>separate and
                        independent</em> ground for the court to grant an interim injunction
                    restraining a beneficiary from making a call on a performance bond (see,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Bocotra
                        Construction Pte Ltd and others v Attorney-General</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 262 at [53] and <em>GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 44 at [16] and [20]; see also the GD at [6]–[7]). This
                    is wider than the English position, which requires fraud to be clearly proved
                    before a call on a performance bond can be restrained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The English position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The English position was first laid down by the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Edward Owen Engineering Ltd v
                        Barclays Bank International Ltd and Another</em>
                    [1978] QB 159 (“<em>Edward Owen
                        Engineering</em>”), which concerned a performance bond that was
                    expressed to be “payable on demand without proof or conditions”
                    (at 166). Lord Denning MR, delivering the leading judgment, held that
                    an on-demand performance bond “[stood] on a similar footing to a letter
                    of credit” (at 171), and, thus, the paying bank (at 171):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… is not concerned in the least with the relations between the
                        supplier [<em>viz</em>, the obligor] and the customer
                            [<em>viz</em>, the beneficiary]; nor with the
                        question whether the supplier has performed his contracted obligation or
                        not; nor with the question whether the supplier is in default or not. The
                        [paying] bank must pay according to its guarantee, on demand, if so
                        stipulated, without proof or conditions. The only exception is when there is
                        … clear fraud of which the [paying] bank has notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In setting out the above principles,
                    Lord Denning was obviously influenced by the well-established autonomy
                    principle applicable to letters of credit, which he acknowledged to be the
                    lifeblood of international trade (see <em>Edward Owen
                        Engineering</em> at 171). The autonomy principle entails that the
                    paying bank must pay under a letter of credit so long as conforming documents
                    are tendered to it. The only exception recognised by the English courts is that
                    of fraud – specifically, the paying bank need not pay “only where
                    there is clear evidence as to the fact of fraud and as to the [paying]
                    bank’s knowledge” (see Peter Ellinger &amp; Dora Neo, <em>The Law and Practice of Documentary Letters of Credit</em>
                    (Hart Publishing, 2010) (“<em>Ellinger &amp;
                        Neo</em>”) at p 316).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The position in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Singapore courts first cast doubt on whether
                    the strict test of “clear fraud” (<em>per</em> Lord Denning in <em>Edward Owen
                        Engineering</em> at 171) was the only test consistent with or
                    permitted by existing law for the purposes of restraining calls on performance
                    bonds (especially those given in connection with building contracts) in
                        <em>Royal Design Studio Pte Ltd v Chang Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 520 in 1990. These reservations
                    were elaborated on in <em>Chartered Electronics Industries Pte
                        Ltd v Development Bank of Singapore</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 20
                        (“<em>Chartered Electronics</em>”), where
                    it was suggested that clear fraud need not be shown and that “a strong
                        <em>prima facie</em> case of fraud” (at [40])
                    would be sufficient. This subsequently led to the development by this court of
                    unconscionability as an alternative ground, <em>separate from and
                        independent of fraud</em>, for restraining a call on a performance
                    bond (see the discussion in <em>Ellinger &amp; Neo</em> at
                    pp 319–323).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Singapore courts’ rationale in
                    applying unconscionability as a separate and independent ground for restraining
                    a call on a performance bond (especially one given by the contractor-obligor in
                    a building contract) is that a performance bond serves a different function from
                    a letter of credit. The latter performs the role of payment by the obligor for
                    goods shipped to it by the beneficiary (typically via sea or air from another
                    country), and “has been the life blood of commerce in international trade
                    for hundreds of years” (see <em>Chartered
                        Electronics</em> at [36]). Interfering with payment under a letter of
                    credit is tantamount to interfering with the <em>primary</em> obligation of the obligor to make payment under its
                    contract with the beneficiary. Hence, payment under a letter of credit should
                    not be disrupted or restrained by the court in the absence of fraud. In
                    contrast, a performance bond is merely security for the <em>secondary</em> obligation of the obligor to pay damages <em>if</em> it breaches its primary contractual obligations to
                    the beneficiary. A performance bond is not the lifeblood of commerce, whether
                    generally or in the context of the construction industry specifically. Thus, a
                    less stringent standard (as compared to the standard applicable <em>vis-à-vis</em> letters of credit) can justifiably be adopted
                    for determining whether a call on a performance bond should be restrained. We
                    should also add that where the wording of a performance bond is ambiguous, the
                    court would be entitled to interpret the performance bond as being conditioned
                    upon facts rather than upon documents or upon a mere demand, contrary to the
                        <em>dictum</em> of Staughton LJ in <em>IE Contractors Ltd v Lloyds Bank Plc and Rafidain Bank</em>
                    [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 496 at 500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Even where a performance bond is expressed to
                    be payable “on first demand without proof or conditions” (as in
                        <em>Edward Owen Engineering</em> (at 170)), which,
                    strictly speaking, means the paying bank is contractually obliged to pay the
                    beneficiary once it makes a call on the performance bond, there is no reason why
                    fraud (which is often difficult to prove) should be the sole ground for
                    restraining the beneficiary from receiving payment. To adopt such a position is
                    to “apply a standard of proof which will virtually assure the beneficiary
                    [of] … immediate payment … and … does nothing more than to
                    transfer the security from the [paying bank] … to the beneficiary”
                    (see <em>Chartered Electronics</em> at [37]). This may in
                    turn cause undue hardship to the obligor in many cases. For instance, where a
                    call is made in bad faith, especially a call for payment of a sum well in excess
                    of the quantum of the beneficiary’s actual or potential loss, the
                    beneficiary will gain more than what it has bargained for. Furthermore, if the
                    amount paid to the beneficiary pursuant to a call is subsequently proved to be
                    in excess of the quantum of its actual loss, the obligor runs the risk of being
                    unable to recover any part of the excess amount should the beneficiary become
                    insolvent. Yet another relevant consideration is that an excessive or abusive
                    call can cause unwarranted economic harm to the obligor. This is particularly
                    relevant in the context of the construction industry, where liquidity is
                    frequently of the essence to contractors. In this regard, while the sum
                    stipulated to be paid under a performance bond is usually pegged at only 5% to
                    10% of the contract price, this typically amounts to one or more progress
                    payments under a building contract. In very large building contracts, the
                    deprivation of a whole progress payment might well be fatal to the
                    contractor-obligor’s liquidity. These concerns are by no means fanciful,
                    as evidenced by the mechanisms evolved by the construction industry to ensure
                    the quick settlement of disputes relating to progress payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In <em>Ellinger &amp;
                        Neo</em> (at p 326), the authors argue, in the context of the
                    construction industry, that where the employer-beneficiary has sacrificed a
                    stronger position for a weaker one (<em>eg</em>, where it
                    has accepted a performance bond in substitution for security in the form of a
                    cash deposit, which is the position in the present case (see cl 11(b) of
                    the Building Contract, which is reproduced at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> below)), it would be justifiable to apply the autonomy
                    principle to the performance bond and treat it as though it were a letter of
                    credit. We find it difficult to agree with this argument for several reasons.
                    First, as a matter of principle, the utilisation of a cash deposit provided as
                    security for the performance of the contractor-obligor’s obligations under
                    a building contract should be treated no differently from the making of a call
                    on a performance bond, which is “third-party” security in that it
                    is always provided by an entity other than the contractor-obligor. It is true
                    that it will be more difficult (if not impossible) in practice to restrain the
                    use of a cash deposit than it will be to restrain the (third-party) paying bank
                    from paying out on a performance bond. But, this will be the case no matter what
                    test is adopted for restraining a call on a performance bond. Moreover, the
                    greater ease, in practical terms, of restraining a call on a performance bond
                    (as compared to restraining the utilisation of a cash deposit provided as
                    security for contractual performance) is a factor which the employer-beneficiary
                    must be taken to have considered and accepted in preferring a performance bond
                    to a cash deposit. In other words, the employer-beneficiary would have a reason
                    for accepting, as security for the contractor-obligor’s contractual
                    performance, a performance bond rather than a cash deposit. One reason could be
                    that the contractor-obligor might have priced its bid for the building contract
                    differently if it had to provide a cash deposit as security for its performance
                    of the contract. In our view, the mere fact that the employer-beneficiary agreed
                    to accept a performance bond in lieu of a cash deposit should not be material in
                    determining whether a call on a performance bond should be
                restrained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In our view, the Singapore position on the
                    circumstances in which the court may restrain a call on a performance bond is
                    justified for the functional and commercial reasons mentioned earlier (at
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). The juridical basis for adopting unconscionability
                    as a relevant ground (separate from and independent of fraud) lies in the
                    equitable nature of the injunction. Considerations of conscionability are
                    applicable in relation to the use of the injunction in other areas of the law,
                    and there is no reason why these considerations should not be applied for the
                    purposes of determining whether a call on a performance bond should be
                    restrained so as to achieve a fair balance between the interests of the
                    beneficiary and those of the obligor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature of the Bond: an on-demand performance bond or an indemnity
                performance bond?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We turn now to consider the nature of the
                    Bond, specifically, whether it was an on-demand performance bond or an indemnity
                    performance bond. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above,
                    although Gammon did not challenge the Judge’s ruling that the Bond was an
                    on-demand performance bond, we think this ruling merits some discussion in view
                    of its potential ramifications for the construction industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To ascertain the nature of the Bond, it is
                    necessary to first consider the relevant provisions of the Building Contract,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The threshold question for the purposes of
                    ascertaining the nature of the Bond is whether, on a true construction of that
                    instrument, the Bank was liable to pay on demand, or only later, upon proof of
                    breach by Gammon and loss by JBE. The construction process looks to the
                    substance of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Bond; the label
                    adopted by the parties is inconclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Bond appeared to have some of the
                    characteristics of an on-demand performance bond in that cl 5 provided that
                    the Bank:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… shall be under no duty to inquire into the reasons, circumstances
                        or authenticity of the grounds for [a] claim [on the Bond] … and

                        … as final and conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, immediately preceding that part of cl 5 just quoted was
                    the provision that the Bank was “obliged to effect the payment required
                    under … a claim … within 30 business days of [its] receipt [of the
                        claim]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This suggested that the
                    Bond was not an on-demand performance bond, but a 30-business day deferred
                    demand performance bond. The question that arises is why JBE chose to accept
                    such a performance bond. No evidence was led by JBE on this matter. One possible
                    inference is that the parties contemplated that once a call on the Bond was
                    made, Gammon would effectively be compelled to take immediate steps to rectify
                    defects in the Building. Another possible inference is that this intervening
                    period was intended to allow Gammon to apply to the court to stop payment under
                    the Bond if it considered JBE’s call to be either fraudulent or
                    unconscionable. In this connection, reference may be made to cl 7.6 of the
                    Building Contract, which expressly provided, <em>vis-à-vis</em> payment on “the banker’s undertaking or
                    any other security held by [JBE]”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that Gammon could
                    intervene “in the case of fraud or unconscionability”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    However, and this point was not argued either before the Judge or before us, it
                    is not clear whether cl 7.6 of the Building Contract was intended to apply
                    generally to all situations, or only in the context of cl 7.5 thereof
                        (<em>ie</em>, only in the event of “any
                    outstanding claim by [JBE] against [Gammon]”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In our view, the crucial determining factor
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the nature of the Bond was cl 1
                    thereof, which stated that the Bank was obliged to indemnify JBE only against
                    “all losses, damages, costs, expenses or [<em>sic</em>] otherwise <em>sustained</em> by
                        [JBE]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added] as a result of
                    Gammon’s breach of the Building Contract. The provision in cl 11(c)
                    of the Building Contract –
                    <em>viz</em>, that JBE could use the Security Deposit (as
                    defined in cl 11(c)) to make good “any loss or damage sustained or
                        <em>likely to be sustained</em> as a result of any
                    breach of contract whatsoever by [Gammon]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]
                    – was omitted from the Bond. Therefore, the obligation of the Bank under
                    the Bond was limited to indemnifying JBE against <em>actual</em> losses which it sustained due to Gammon’s breach of
                    the Building Contract. Since the payment obligation of the Bank was so limited,
                    the Bond, in our view, had the character of a true indemnity performance bond.
                    In this regard, it is arguable that cl 5 of the Bond (<em>viz</em>, the provision that the Bank was “under no duty to
                    inquire into the reasons, circumstances or authenticity of the grounds [of any
                    call on the Bond]”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> would not affect the
                    requirement that JBE could only call on the Bond if and when it actually
                    suffered loss arising from any breach by Gammon of its obligations under the
                    Building Contract. At the very least, the Bond could be said to be ambiguous as
                    to whether payment under it was conditioned upon demand or upon proof of actual
                    loss arising from Gammon’s breach of contract, and, therefore, the court
                    should construe it as a true indemnity performance bond (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above on the effect of ambiguity in the terms
                    of a performance bond).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue for decision in this appeal: Was the Judge right to
                restrain JBE from making a call on the Bond?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We now turn to address the issue arising for
                    decision in this appeal, <em>viz</em>, whether the Judge
                    was correct in restraining JBE from receiving payment under the Bond (see
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). Given our ruling that the
                    Bond should be construed as a true indemnity performance bond (which meant that
                    JBE was not entitled to call on the Bond unless and until it had suffered actual
                    loss as a result of Gammon’s breach of the Building Contract), the
                    correctness or otherwise of the Judge’s decision would depend on the
                    evidence adduced by JBE to prove its alleged actual loss. In this regard, the
                    only evidence that JBE relied on before both the Judge and this court was the
                    fact that it had to appoint a company called Weng Thai Construction
                    (“WTC”) to rectify defects in the cladding of the Building
                    (“the Cladding Defects”) at the price of $2,200,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The circumstances surrounding JBE’s
                    employment of WTC to rectify the Cladding Defects were as follows. On
                    12 February 2008, the superintending officer for the Building Contract
                    (“the Superintending Officer”) issued a completion certificate
                    (“the Completion Certificate”) stating that “on
                        16<sup>th</sup> January 2008, the Works have been
                    completed and appeared to comply with the [Building] Contract in all respects
                    (save and except [for] the minor outstanding works listed in Part 1 of the
                    Schedule to this Certificate)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These “minor outstanding
                        works”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> included works to rectify
                    the Cladding Defects (“the Rectification Works”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     During the defects liability period, the
                    Superintending Officer notified the parties of a number of defects in the
                    Building. There was a considerable amount of friction between the parties with
                    regard to the rectification of these defects and other issues under the Building
                    Contract. What is pertinent for present purposes is the Superintending
                    Officer’s instruction to Gammon on 8 January 2009 to rectify specific
                    defects in the Building.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>That instruction (“SOI 271/09”), which included
                    37 pages of photographs, identified 104 defects, most of which consisted of the
                    Cladding Defects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before Gammon could take any steps to rectify
                    the defects listed in SOI 271/09 (the majority of which were, as just
                    mentioned, the Cladding Defects), JBE proceeded on 10 January 2009 to
                    solicit quotations from other contractors, purportedly for the Rectification
                    Works (as defined at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). Quotations
                    were received from the following contractors (collectively, “the
                    Contractors”):</p>

<p class="Judg-1">On
                    10 February 2009, JBE awarded the Rectification Works to WTC at the
                    latter’s quoted price, <em>viz</em>,
                    $2,200,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Based on WTC’s quoted price for the
                    Rectification Works, together with the alleged costs of curing other defects in
                    the Building, JBE claimed that the outstanding sum due to it from Gammon
                    amounted to $2,966,402.90 (see [8] of the GD). On that basis, JBE called on the
                    Bond for the entire sum of $1,151,500. In response, Gammon applied (via
                    SUM 1224/2009) for an interim injunction to prevent JBE from receiving
                    payment under the Bond on the basis that the Bond was not an on-demand
                    performance bond, or, alternatively, on the basis that JBE’s call was
                    unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before the Judge, and likewise on appeal, the
                    issue of unconscionability focused on the award of the Rectification Works to
                    WTC at the price of $2,200,800. It will be readily seen that, shorn of this sum,
                    the amount of $2,966,402.90 allegedly due from Gammon to JBE would be reduced to
                    $765,602.90, which was far less than the amount owed by JBE to Gammon (that
                    amount was estimated by JBE to be $1,146,204.31 (see the GD at [8]) and by
                    Gammon to be $1,704,912.64 (see the GD at [12])). In other words, if the alleged
                    cost of rectifying the Cladding Defects were not taken into account, JBE would
                    owe money to Gammon on a net basis and, accordingly, would not be entitled to
                    call for payment of the entire sum of $1,151,500 due under the
                Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At [14] of the GD, the Judge ruled that
                    JBE’s call on the Bond on the basis of the award of the Rectification
                    Works to WTC was “clearly unconscionable, abusive and bordered on being
                    fraudulent”. The main reasons which he gave for his decision were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The letter of award issued by JBE to
                        WTC for the Rectification Works was a one-page document devoid of detail as
                        to WTC’s scope of work (see the GD at [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     WTC did not appear to have any
                        expertise in designing, fabricating and installing cladding on buildings, as
                        evidenced by its supposed intention to appoint another entity, CLK Systems
                        Pte Ltd, to carry out the Rectification Works (see the GD at
                    [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        subcontractor originally appointed by Gammon to carry out cladding works on
                        the Building, Seiko Architectural Wall Systems Pte Ltd, had charged only
                        $371,664 for designing, fabricating, supplying and installing cladding for
                        the whole of the Building. In contrast, WTC’s quoted price was
                        “a hefty six times more” (see the GD at
                    [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     It would be
                        “most surprising” (see the GD at [13]) for the Superintending
                        Officer to have issued a completion certificate for a project priced at
                        $11,515,000 if rectification works costing $2,200,800 (as JBE alleged)
                        remained outstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     Pursuant to a direction made by the Judge in the course of the
                        hearing, Gammon sought quotations for the Rectification Works so that a
                        comparison could be made with the price quoted by WTC. The highest quotation
                        obtained by Gammon was $560,000, based on a total replacement of the
                        defective cladding, and the next highest quotation was $335,000, based on
                        repairing the defective cladding. Both of these quotations indicated that
                        WTC’s quoted price of $2,200,800 for the Rectification Works was
                        “grossly inflated” (see the GD at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     To rebut the Judge’s ruling that JBE had
                    made an unconscionable call on the Bond, JBE’s counsel argued that the
                    Judge’s assessment of unconscionability, which was based on WTC’s
                    quoted price for the Rectification Works, was wrong for several reasons,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     WTC’s quotation was the lowest
                        of the four quotations obtained by JBE, the highest of which was $2,741,600
                        (this argument by counsel was factually wrong as WTC’s quotation was
                        the second highest of the four quotations (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above), but we shall not take issue with it in these
                        grounds of decision as it is not a material point);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     the other three quotations obtained by
                        JBE for the Rectification Works were not impugned; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     the cost of carrying out the cladding
                        work entailed by the Rectification Works had increased since the Building
                        Contract was entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We did not accept JBE’s argument as it
                    did not address the main factor which cast doubt on the accuracy and validity of
                    WTC’s quotation for the Rectification Works, namely, the basis on which
                    WTC made that quotation. It may be recalled that the Rectification Works were
                    for the Cladding Defects, which were the defects (among others) that Gammon had
                    to rectify pursuant to SOI 271/09. According to the Completion Certificate,
                    the Cladding Defects were “minor”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, to rectify
                    these defects, WTC proposed the “<em>removal</em>,
                    supply &amp; <em>re-install [sic]</em> of …
                    aluminium composite panels”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added].
                    Similarly, the other three quotations for the Rectification Works were based on
                    the removal of the defective cladding and the installation of new cladding for
                    the whole of the Building. Specifically:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     Millionbuilt proposed the
                        “[d]esign, supply &amp; installation of aluminium cladding to
                            <em>replace existing cladding

                        added], with the total cladding area estimated to be
                            4,900m<sup>2</sup>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Jan Façade proposed the “<em>[r]emoval</em> of existing aluminium composite panel[s]
                        and its associate works”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
                        added] and the “[s]upply and <em>installation of new

                        necessary sub-frames and fixing accessories”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added] (Jan Façade
                        also stated that “[d]ue to the <em>complexity</em> of this project, [it would] not accept partial
                        replacement works”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
                        added]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     WHA Engineering proposed the “re-alignment, <em>removal and replacement</em> of damaged
                            panel[s]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added], with the
                        area to be repaired estimated to be
                        5,200m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The descriptions given by the Contractors as
                    to the proposed scope of the Rectification Works show that each of them
                    contemplated the replacement of the cladding of the whole of the Building, even
                    though the Cladding Defects were described in the Completion Certificate as
                        “minor”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> defects. Counsel for
                    JBE contended that the Cladding Defects were not in fact minor, but he was
                    unable to refer to any evidence to support his argument. We also note that, for
                    reasons which it did not explain and also did not offer to explain, JBE failed
                    to disclose to the court the letters which it sent to the Contractors inviting
                    them to submit quotations for the Rectification Works. That said, JBE’s
                    non-disclosure in this regard was, in our view, relatively inconsequential.
                    Instead, what was material was the nature of the Cladding Defects. We have
                    already pointed out that those defects were said to be
                        “minor”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> in the
                    Completion Certificate. The Judge likewise held at [11] of the GD that the
                    Cladding Defects were “relatively minor”. After examining the
                    evidence on record, we agreed with this finding. Given the nature of the
                    Cladding Defects, and assuming that the quotations obtained by JBE from the
                    Contractors were genuine, it was incongruous for JBE to have relied on
                    quotations for <em>replacing</em> the existing cladding of
                    the whole of the Building and <em>installing new
                        cladding</em>, as opposed to quotations for <em>rectifying</em> the Cladding Defects. Further, even if the
                    Contractors’ quotations were indeed for the rectification of the Cladding
                    Defects, they were <em>prima facie</em> grossly inflated
                    and exorbitant, given that the highest quotation for the Rectification Works
                    which Gammon obtained pursuant to the Judge’s direction was only $560,000.
                    Viewed as a whole, the evidence adduced by JBE of its alleged actual loss
                    arising from Gammon’s breach of the Building Contract indicated, as the
                    Judge rightly held, that “there was gross exaggeration of the costs of
                    rectification … in support of [JBE’s] call on the [B]ond”
                    (see the GD at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the above reasons, we were of the view
                    that JBE had failed to show that, at the date of its call on the Bond, it had
                    suffered actual loss arising from Gammon’s breach of the Building Contract
                    – proof of such actual loss was essential in the present case, given our
                    ruling (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above) that the Bond should
                    be construed as a true indemnity performance bond. We should add that even if
                    the Bond were construed as an on-demand performance bond (<em>cf</em> our ruling), JBE’s call on it was unconscionable for
                    the reasons given by the Judge (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Ancillary Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before we conclude these grounds of decision,
                    there is one final matter which we should address, namely, the Ancillary Orders.
                    In essence, these orders: (a) directed Gammon to rectify (<em>inter alia</em>) the defects listed in SOI 271/09 within
                    six months; and (b) required JBE and Gammon to call a joint tender for a
                    contractor to make good any of the defects not rectified by Gammon. The
                    Ancillary Orders were not sought by either party, and we did not think it was
                    proper for the Judge to have made those orders, even if they might have
                    represented the best way to resolve the outstanding issues between the parties.
                    We thus set aside those orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the result, we dismissed the present appeal
                    against the Judge’s decision to grant the Interim Injunction, and set
                    aside the Ancillary Orders. We ordered the costs here and below to be costs in
                    the cause, and also made the usual consequential orders.</p>
