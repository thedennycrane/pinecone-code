<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns a caveat (“the
                    Caveat”) lodged by the Defendant moneylender on a property (“the
                    Property”) held by the Plaintiff and her ex-husband (“Zam”)
                    as joint tenants. The Caveat was lodged to secure the Defendant’s interest
                    in the sale proceeds of the Property to repay a loan that Zam obtained from the
                    Defendant. The Plaintiff claims that she did not consent to the lodgement of the
                    Caveat on the Property and is applying for it to be removed. As will be seen,
                    this case raises some interesting and difficult issues of land law, in
                    particular, the law in relation to caveats.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff and Zam were married on 24
                    November 1995 and divorced on 6 December 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Defendant is a licensed moneylender under
                    the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the
                MLA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The rest of the facts are disputed. I will
                    therefore present both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s accounts
                    separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 24 September 2009, Zam approached the
                    Defendant to borrow $2,000 for the Hari Raya festive season. He filled up the
                    loan application form and submitted copies of the supporting documents required,
                    such as his identification card and recent payslips. The Defendant then informed
                    Zam that his loan application was approved for the sum of $1,000 and asked him
                    return with the Plaintiff to sign the loan documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Zam then returned with the Plaintiff to the
                    Defendant’s premises on 26 September 2009. There, Zam signed various
                    documents including a contract stating that he was borrowing $1,000 at an
                    interest rate of 297% per annum. Paragraph 6 of the notes to the contract
                    (“the Notes to the Contract”) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6)    A caveat will be lodged under the borrower’s
                            property if the payment is not prompt and at anytime at the sole
                            discretion of [the Defendant]. And will be removed upon completion of
                            Loan payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Further, both Zam and the Plaintiff signed a
                    document authorising and consenting to the lodgement of a caveat by the
                    Defendant on the Property (“the 1st ACLC”). The Defendant tendered
                    a copy of the 1st ACLC bearing what purports to be Zam’s and the
                    Plaintiff’s signatures. The pertinent part of the 1st ACLC states as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 21 October 2009, Zam approached the Defendant
                    again to borrow another $1,000. As Zam had been making prompt repayments of the
                    26 September 2009 loan (“the 1st Loan”), the Defendant agreed to
                    grant Zam a further loan of $1,000 (“the 2nd Loan”). The 2nd Loan
                    was advanced on the same terms as the 1st Loan (apart from the schedule for
                    repayment) save that this time, by the Defendant’s own admission, it did
                    not ask for or obtain the Plaintiff’s authorisation and consent to the
                    lodgement of a caveat on the Property. The caveat authorisation document for the
                    2nd Loan (“the 2nd ACLC”) only bears Zam’s
                signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Zam fully repaid the 1st Loan promptly. However,
                    he was imprisoned for drug offences shortly after he obtained the 2nd Loan and
                    failed to repay any part thereof despite repeated reminders (as of 23 January
                    2014, the outstanding sum he owed to the Defendant, including principal,
                    interest and late fees, was $28,334.19). On 19 November 2009, the Defendant took
                    out the Caveat on the Property stating the following ground of claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Persuant [<em>sic</em>] to a Loan Application (The
                        Moneylenders Act 2009, Cap 188) dated 21 October 2009 made between the
                        Registered Proprietor and the Caveator and the Registered Proprietor agreed
                        to pay and settle all debts owing to the Caveator from the proceeds of sale
                        of the land above described. Pending the sale of the land above described,
                        the Registered Proprietor have agreed and consented to the lodgement of this
                        Caveat to secure the Caveator’s interest in the proceeds of the sale
                        of the land above described, thereby creating an equitable interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 6 December 2012, the Plaintiff obtained a
                    divorce from the Syariah Court. The Syariah Court ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Property be transferred to the Plaintiff,
                    with no refunds to be made to the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund
                    account (“the Syariah Court Order”). The Plaintiff then filed a
                    transfer application with the Housing Development Board (“HDB”),
                    whereupon she was informed by the HDB that the Property could not be transferred
                    until the Caveat was removed. According to the Plaintiff, this was the first
                    time she discovered the existence of the Caveat. She denies ever accompanying
                    Zam to the Defendant’s premises to apply for a loan, and says that the
                    signature on the 1st ACLC is not hers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In addition, Zam affirmed a statutory
                    declaration on 27 November 2013 (which the Plaintiff exhibited to her affidavit)
                    stating that he approached the Defendant for a loan of $1,000 “[s]ometime
                    in 2009”. He was handed a one-page loan document which referred only to
                    the fact of the loan and the terms of repayment; there was no mention at all
                    that the loan would be paid from the sale proceeds from the Property or that a
                    caveat would be lodged against the Property. Zam duly paid three instalments of
                    the loan and defaulted on the balance payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Plaintiff submits that the Caveat should
                    be removed on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Caveat is defective because it
                        failed to identify the particulars of the estate or interest claimed by the
                        Defendant, as required by s 115(1)(c) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004
                        Rev Ed) (“the LTA”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was no consent from both the Plaintiff and Zam to
                        the lodgement of the Caveat by the Defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     even if there was such consent, it did not
                        create an “interest in land” within the meaning of s 115(1) of
                        the LTA entitling the Defendant to lodge the Caveat; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     in any event, any agreement to use the
                        Property or its sale proceeds as security or collateral for Zam’s debt
                        is void pursuant to s 51(1) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap
                        129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the HDA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I should note that the Plaintiff is <em>not</em> arguing that the interest rate charged by the Defendant is
                    excessive under s 23 of the MLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     For its part, the Defendant contends that by
                    signing the 1st ACLC on 26 September 2009, Zam and the Plaintiff had given it an
                    interest in the proceeds of the sale of the Property, which constitutes an
                    “interest in land” entitling the Defendant to lodge the Caveat.
                    Although the Plaintiff did not sign the 2nd ACLC, the two loans should be seen
                    as one transaction. In the alternative, Zam’s consent alone was sufficient
                    to confer on the Defendant an interest in the sale proceeds of the Property
                    under the concept of joint tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The factual issues and their significance </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There is a factual dispute between the parties
                    on whether Zam and the Plaintiff had agreed to the Caveat being lodged on the
                    Property in the event of Zam’s default. On the evidence before me, I
                    consider the Defendant’s account to be far more credible. The Defendant
                    has tendered a copy of the 1st ACLC bearing what appears to be Zam’s and
                    the Plaintiff’s signature, as well as a copy of the 2nd ACLC bearing
                    Zam’s signature. On the other hand, the Plaintiff has simply issued a bare
                    denial that she signed the 1st ACLC and has failed to prove that the signature
                    purporting to be hers on the 1st ACLC is a forgery, which she could easily have
                    done by tendering copies of other official documents bearing her actual
                    signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I also disbelieve the Plaintiff’s claim
                    that she only became aware of the Caveat when she attempted to effect the
                    transfer of the Property. Under s 117 of the LTA, the Registrar of Titles
                    (“the Registrar”) is required to notify the caveatee whenever a
                    caveat has been lodged and accepted by the Registrar. The Defendant has tendered
                    evidence of a letter from the Registrar stating that notice of the Caveat was
                    sent by post to the address of the Property on 3 December 2009. In response, the
                    Plaintiff could only say that she did not receive the said letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the account of facts contained in
                    Zam’s statutory declaration, I find it to be inconsistent with the
                    documentary evidence and place no weight on it. Zam makes no mention of the fact
                    that he took out two loans, and claims that he was only given a one-page loan
                    document to sign. However, the Defendant has tendered copies of the loan
                    documents evidencing both the 1st Loan and the 2nd Loan. The documents for each
                    loan numbered about 8–10 pages, and each page bore Zam’s signature
                    and thumbprint (with the exception of the ACLCs, which bore his signature but
                    not his thumbprint). There is no indication that these documents are anything
                    but genuine, and it would indeed be quite preposterous for the Defendant to
                    resort to falsifying them and forging Zam’s signature for the purpose of
                    recovering a relatively miniscule debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     That said, the above factual findings are
                    ultimately immaterial because, in my view, this case turns on the following
                    issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Do the 2nd ACLC and the other loan
                        documents (collectively, the “Loan Documents”) confer on the
                        Defendant an interest in the Property that is capable of supporting the
                        Caveat?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Assuming that the Defendant has an interest in the Property, should the
                        Caveat nonetheless be removed for failure to comply with the formal
                        requirements of s 115 of the LTA?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Do the Loan Documents confer on the Defendant an interest in the
                Property?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Plaintiff’s consent to the 2nd ACLC was
                required</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is common ground that the Caveat was lodged
                    in respect of the 2nd Loan and not the 1st Loan (which the Defendant says was
                    repaid promptly). Consequently, does it matter that the Plaintiff did not sign
                    the 2nd ACLC?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As a preliminary point, I have no hesitation
                    in rejecting the Defendant’s submission that the two loans should be
                    considered as part of the same transaction. The two loans were obtained on
                    separate occasions and a separate set of documentation was prepared for each.
                    Furthermore, the claim in the Caveat (reproduced at [9] above) distinguishes
                    between the two loans by referring to a loan application dated 21 October 2009
                        (<em>ie</em>, the 2nd Loan). Therefore, the two loans
                    did not form part of the same transaction, and the Plaintiff’s consent to
                    the 1st ACLC in respect of the 1st Loan could not bind her in respect of the 2nd
                    Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I turn then to the legal issue of whether the
                    Plaintiff’s consent was required for the 2nd ACLC. The Defendant says that
                    Zam’s consent alone was sufficient to bind the Property under the concept
                    of joint tenancy. The sole authority provided by the Defendant for this
                    proposition is <em>Kua Hui Li v Prosper Credit Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2014] 3 SLR 1007 (“<em>Kua Hui Li</em>”).
                    That case also involved an application by a plaintiff to remove a caveat lodged
                    on her property by a moneylender. The caveat was lodged pursuant to a loan
                    agreement between the plaintiff’s former husband and the moneylender under
                    which the husband agreed to repay the loan from the sale proceeds of the
                    property and consented to the lodgement of a caveat by the moneylender against
                    the property. The plaintiff did not consent to this arrangement. Choo J noted
                    that the following questions arose (at [8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    First, was the contract signed between OBL and the
                            defendant valid?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Second, had OBL and the defendant entered into any
                            further contract (presumably pursuant to the $3,000 loan)? And if so,
                            were those further contracts valid?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Third, if there were any valid contracts, did any
                            of those contracts serve to create an interest in the Property in favour
                            of the defendant, notwithstanding that the plaintiff, as a co-owner, was
                            not informed, and neither was her consent procured?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    Fourth, if the defendant did indeed have an
                            interest in the Property when it lodged the caveat, are there any
                            reasons that justify the removal of the caveat?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, Choo J ultimately did not answer the
                    third and fourth questions because he found that the interest rate charged by
                    the moneylender in that case (namely, 791.61% per annum) was excessive and set
                    aside the loan agreement under s 23(3)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    MLA (at [14]). I therefore fail to see how <em>Kua Hui
                        Li</em> assists the Defendant in any way. In fact, it is trite that
                    joint tenants have to act jointly to effectively bind the estate which they hold
                    jointly: Tan Sook Yee, Tang Hang Wu and Kelvin F K Low, <em>Tan
                        Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</em> (LexisNexis,
                    3rd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Tan Sook Yee</em>”) at
                    para 9.9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     But that is not the end of the issue. Might it
                    be argued that a joint tenant’s assignment of his legal or equitable
                    interest in the <em>sale proceeds</em> of a property is an
                    act operating upon his own share that severs the joint tenancy and converts it
                    into a tenancy in common? In the leading case of <em>Williams v
                        Hensman</em> (1861) 1 John &amp; H 546 at 557, Page Wood VC set out
                    the following three methods of severance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A joint tenancy may be severed in three ways: in the first place, an act
                        of any one of the persons interested operating upon his own share may create
                        a severance as to that share ... Secondly, a joint-tenancy may be severed by
                        mutual agreement. And, in the third place, there may be a severance by any
                        course of dealing sufficient to intimate that the interests of all were
                        mutually treated as constituting a tenancy in common.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This is a vexed area of law. For example, the
                    English and Australian authorities appear to be divided over whether a charge
                    granted by one joint tenant to a third party is an alienation that effectively
                    severs a joint tenancy: <em>Tan Sook Yee</em> at para 9.40.
                    In his article “Partial Alienation by One Co-Owner of Land” [2000]
                    SJLS 92, Professor Barry Crown surveyed the difficulties in this area and
                    concluded as follows (at 108–109):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The difficulties that have occurred in working out the
                        effects of a partial alienation have their root in the doctrine that each
                        joint tenant owns the whole of the estate and not merely a proportionate
                        share. The problem is compounded when this is coupled with the idea that it
                        is possible for one joint tenant to alienate an interest that he does not
                        actually have and that he thereby creates the very interest which was
                        supposedly the subject matter of the transfer in the first place. These
                        notions are too firmly rooted in English law to be set aside now. However,
                        as Lord Nicholls stated in the recent House of Lords case of <em>Burton v London Borough of Camden</em> [[2000] 2 AC 399
                        at 404–405],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The legal concept relied upon ... is that a joint tenant, as distinct
                            from a tenant in common, has nothing to transfer to the other tenant,
                            because each already owns the whole. I have to say that this esoteric
                            concept is remote from the realities of life. It should be handled with
                            care, and applied with caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An attempt has been made in this article to follow this guidance and to
                        look at the law of severance in the light of the realities of life. The most
                        important factor is the existence in Singapore of a simple and effective
                        method of severance by statute. This, coupled with the need to ensure that
                        parties are fully aware of their rights and that no one party should be able
                        to sever behind the back of his fellow co-owners, means that the courts
                        should not be astute to discover new methods of severance and, in
                        particular, should avoid legitimising any form of severance which can be
                        effected by one party without the knowledge of the other joint
                        tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, I need not decide this issue because
                    I find that, <em>as a matter of interpretation</em>, the
                    Loan Documents did not confer on the Defendant any legal or equitable interest
                    in the sale proceeds of the Property. I will elaborate on this later in the next
                    section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Defendant has an interest in the proceeds of sale of
                land</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The meaning of “interest in the proceeds of sale of
                land”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Section 115 of the LTA allows any person
                    “claiming an interest in land” to lodge with the Registrar a
                    caveat prohibiting the registration of any dealing affecting the land. Two other
                    sections in the LTA are pertinent for the purposes of construing the phrase
                    “claiming an interest in land”. The first is s 4, which defines
                    “interest” as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“interest”, in relation to land, means any interest in land
                        recognised as such by law, and includes an estate in land;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The second is s 115(3), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) For the purposes of this Part, and without limiting its
                        generality, a reference to a person claiming an interest in land shall
                        include a reference to any of the following persons:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) <em>any person who
                                has an interest in the proceeds of sale of land</em>, not
                            being an interest arising from a judgment or order for the payment of
                            money; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) a person who has obtained an
                            injunction in respect of an estate or interest in land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Defendant contends that the effect of the
                    Loan Documents was that they granted it an interest in the sale proceeds of the
                    Property. Pursuant to s 115(3)(<em>a</em>), this counts as
                    an “interest in land” for the purpose of lodging a caveat. In
                    reply, the Plaintiff submits that the Loan Documents merely granted Zam’s
                    authorisation and consent for the Defendant to lodge a caveat, which is
                    insufficient to create an interest in land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There are thus two issues that I have to
                    decide:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     What does “interest in the
                        proceeds of the sale of land” in s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) mean?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Do the Loan Documents create such an
                    interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The progenitor of s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) of the LTA is s 93(1)(3) of the Land Titles Ordinance 1956
                    (“the LTO”). That sub-section stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>93.</b>—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) For the Purposes of this Part, and without limiting its generality, an
                        interest in the proceeds of sale of land shall be deemed an interest in
                        land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Significantly, no such provision can be found
                    in the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) (“the NSW RPA”), on which the
                    LTO was modelled (the drafter of the LTO, John Baalman
                    (“Baalman”), was an expert in the Torrens system of land titles
                    registration in New South Wales: <em>ACS Computer Pte Ltd v
                        Rubina Watch Co (Pte) Ltd and another</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 1006 at
                    [18]). Section 74B(1) of the NSW RPA simply states: “A person who claims
                    a legal or equitable estate or interest in land that is the subject of a primary
                    application, or in any part of any such land, may … lodge with the
                    Registrar-General a caveat prohibiting the bringing of that land or part under
                    the provisions of this Act”. The same can be said of similar provisions
                    in other Australian jurisdictions, such as s 89(1) of the Transfer of Land Act
                    1958 (Vic). Consequently, the Australian courts have held that an interest in
                    the sale proceeds of land is insufficient to found a caveat. In <em>Dykstra and another v Dysktra</em> (1991) 22 NSWLR 556, the
                    Supreme Court of New South Wales noted that a contractual right to payment of a
                    sum of money out of the proceeds of sale of a particular property does not give
                    rise to a caveatable interest (at 559). In <em>Epple v
                        Wilson</em> [1972] VR 440, the Supreme Court of Victoria held that an
                        <em>equitable</em> right to the sale proceeds does not
                    do so either (at 444).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is therefore necessary to consider why
                    Baalman included s 93(3) in the LTO. Some light is shed by his authoritative
                    commentary on the LTO. He wrote in <em>The Singapore Torrens
                        System</em> (The Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) at pp
                    195–196:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The number of interests which will justify the lodging of a
                        caveat is limited by the number of permissible “interests in
                        land”. In <em>Keppel</em> v. <em>Bailey</em> (1834) 2 My. &amp; K. 517, 535; 39 E.R. 1042,
                            <em>Lord Brougham</em>, L.C. said,—</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“It must not be supposed that incidents of a novel kind can be
                            devised and attached to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner.
                            It is clearly inconvenient both to the science of the law and the public
                            weal that such latitude should be given. There can be no harm in
                            allowing the fullest latitude to men in binding themselves … to
                            answer in damages for breach of their obligations … But great
                            detriment would arise and much confusion of rights if parties were
                            allowed to invent new modes of holding and enjoying real
                            property.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A new interest in land can be created only by legislation – either
                        parliamentary, as in the case of perpetual leases, or judicial, as in the
                        case of restrictive covenants … There is nothing in the [LTO] to
                        suggest that this is one of the occasions on which the Legislature intended
                        to create a new interest in land to be known as a caveatable
                        interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A person entitled to land which has undergone the
                            transformation effected by the equitable doctrine of conversion, would
                            prima facie cease to have a caveatable interest. Section 93 (3) operates
                            to reconvert an interest in the proceeds of sale of land (e.g. under a
                            trust for sale) into an interest in land.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The equitable doctrine of conversion that
                    Baalman referred to requires some elaboration. One of the common law methods for
                    settling land was the device of a trust for sale. This arose where land was
                    transferred by deed or will to trustees with an imperative direction that they
                    were to effect a sale and to hold the proceeds of sale upon certain specified
                    trusts. The equitable doctrine of conversion states that in such cases, the
                    interests of the beneficiaries were in the proceeds of sale and not in the land,
                    because equity looks on that as done which ought to be done – the
                    imperative direction to turn land into money impresses the land with the quality
                    of money no matter how long the sale may be postponed. The effect of this
                    doctrine was that when the trustees sold the land in performance of their duty
                    to sell, the purchaser took the land free of any trusts, since the beneficial
                    interests were imposed upon the sale proceeds and not the land itself: see
                    Edward H Burn and John Cartwright, <em>Cheshire and Burn’s
                        Modern Law of Real Property</em> (Oxford University Press, 18th Ed,
                    2011) at pp 104–105.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The equitable doctrine of conversion gives
                    rise to problems in cases where the operation of another legal mechanism is
                    contingent on the beneficiary of a trust for sale having an interest in land.
                    One example can be found in the case of <em>Irani Finance Ltd v
                        Singh and others</em> [1971] 1 Ch 59. Under s 35 of the Administration
                    of Justice Act 1956 (c 46) (UK), a judgment creditor could obtain a court order
                    imposing a charge on “any such land or interest in land of the
                    debtor” to secure the payment of the judgment debt. The issue was whether
                    the first and second defendants, who were legal and equitable tenants of land
                    conveyed to them under a trust for sale, had “land or interest in
                    land” capable of being charged under s 35. The Court of Appeal held that
                    they did not, reasoning as follows (at 79–80):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The words "interest in land" are no doubt capable in an
                        appropriate context of including interests under trusts for sale of land,
                        and though there is no need for us to express a concluded opinion on the
                        point we certainly do not wish to be taken to be casting any doubt on the
                        correctness of the dicta in <em>Cooper</em> v.
                            <em>Critchley</em> [1955] Ch. 431, but for 100
                        years before 1956 the words, or equivalent words, have been held in this
                        field not to include interests arising under trusts for sale. If it had been
                        the intention of Parliament in 1956 to subject interests or some interests
                        arising under trusts for sale of land to charges for judgment debts, it
                        would surely have done so in clear terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The whole purpose of the trust for sale is to make sure, by
                        shifting the equitable interests away from the land and into the proceeds of
                        sale, that a purchaser of the land takes free from the equitable interests.
                        To hold these to be equitable interests in the land itself would be to
                        frustrate this purpose. Even to hold that they have equitable interests in
                        the land for a limited period, namely, until the land is sold, would, we
                        think, be inconsistent with the trust for sale being an "immediate" trust
                        for sale working an immediate conversion, which is what the Law of Property
                        Act, 1925, envisages (see section 205 (1) (xxix)), though, of course, it is
                        not in fact only such a limited interest that the plaintiffs are seeking to
                        charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It therefore appears that the purpose of s
                        115(3)(<em>a</em>) of the LTA is to avoid difficulties
                    like these and allow a beneficiary of a trust for sale to protect his or her
                    interest by means of a caveat. This is not to say, however, that
                        s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) is restricted only to
                    individuals whose interests arise under a trust for sale. The provision is
                    phrased in general terms, and Baalman himself made it clear that the trust for
                    sale is just one example under which a person might acquire an interest in the
                    sale proceeds of land. Another example might be the interest of a foreign person
                    who inherits a property under the will of the deceased owner or through the law
                    on intestate succession: <em>Tan Sook Yee</em> at para
                    15.11. Under s 3(3) of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed), no
                    estate or interest in the property would pass to the foreign person; however, s
                    3(4) imposes a duty on the personal representatives of the deceased to sell the
                    property within five years and pay the net sale proceeds to the foreign person.
                    A foreign person in such a situation might therefore be said to have an interest
                    in the proceeds of sale of land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In both of the above cases, the caveator has a
                    definite entitlement to the proceeds of sale because the trustee or the personal
                    representative is charged with a <em>duty</em> of sale.
                    There is no doubt that the property has to be sold, and the only issue to be
                    decided is that of timing. It therefore makes sense to allow such persons to
                    lodge caveats to protect their interest in the sale proceeds. But where there is
                        <em>no</em> duty of sale and the caveator’s
                    interest in the sale proceeds is wholly contingent on the owner of the property
                    deciding to sell, would that suffice as a caveatable interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     If the matter were free of authority, I would
                    have thought that such an interest would be insufficient to support a caveat.
                    Such a nebulous interest appears too far removed from the type of the interest
                    that s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) of the LTA was originally meant
                    to protect. But at least two cases have held that a right to be paid out of the
                    sale proceeds of land is a caveatable interest, even where there is no duty of
                    sale. First, in <em>Abdul Hamid Bin Mohamed Ismail and Others v
                        Shaik Raheem s/o Abdul Shaik Shaik Dawood and Another Action</em>
                    [2005] SGDC 28 (“<em>Abdul Hamid</em>”), the
                    plaintiffs obtained a $20,000 loan from a licensed moneylender. The relevant
                    terms of the loan agreement were as follows (at [7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">Covenant to give notice</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The Borrowers covenant with the Company that at all
                            times before full payment of the loan and interest not to sell or
                            transfer or otherwise dispose of their interest in the flat at Block 138
                            Bukit Batok West Avenue 6 #02-389 Singapore 650138 (hereinafter referred
                            to as “the Flat”) without giving prior notice of at least
                            seven (7) days of the date of such sale transfer or otherwise to the
                            Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assignment of sale proceeds</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The Borrowers agree that the sale proceeds of the
                            sale of the Flat that the Borrowers may become entitled or receive from
                            the purchaser of the Flat have been assigned to the Company for the
                            repayment of all monies due to the Company under the Terms and
                            conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Consent to Caveat</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The Borrowers hereby consent to the Company lodging
                            a Caveat with the Singapore Land Registry against the title of the Flat
                            and confirm that the Company has an interest in the sale proceeds of the
                            sale of the Flat PROVIDED THAT the Company shall on receipt of all
                            monies due and owing to the Company by the Borrowers withdraw the
                            Caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further Assurance</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The Borrowers shall at all times if and required by

                            proceeds of the Flat to the Company or the due payment of the Loan to
                            the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The district judge held that the moneylender
                    was entitled to lodge a caveat on the plaintiffs’ property. Her reasoning
                    merits setting out in full (at [19]–[21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    On principles of statutory interpretation, I could
                            not agree with the plaintiffs’ submissions. The wording of section
                            115(3)(a) read in their plain and literal sense clearly intended to
                            widen the scope of “interest in land” for purposes of
                            caveats to include a person who has an interest in the proceeds of sale
                            of the land which may not necessarily arise from recognized categories
                            of interests in land. It should be noted that the interpretations in
                            section 4 are prefaced with the words “<em>unless
                                the context otherwise requires</em>”. The opening words
                            of section 115(3)(a) – “<em>For the purposes
                                of this Part</em>”- in themselves already set a
                            different context altogether to require a different meaning to be
                            accorded to the word “interest”. This preamble to section
                            115(3)(a) must surely signify a legislative intent to import a wider
                            interpretation to the definition of “interest in land” in
                            the part of the Act dealing with caveats than those appearing in the
                            other parts of the Act. If the plaintiffs’ contentions <em>viz</em> that these words should be restricted to the
                            definition of “interest” as in section 4, reflect the true
                            intent of Parliament, section 115(3)(a) would, in my view, be rendered
                            otiose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    If the interpretation of section 115(3)(a) has to
                            be circumscribed in the manner advocated by the plaintiffs, it would not
                            have been necessary for Parliament to introduce the amendment in 2001 to
                            delimit the categories of interests to those “<em>not being an interest arising from a judgment or order for the
                                payment of money</em>”. It must have been contemplated
                            that the category of caveatable interests in section 115(3)(a) would
                            include interests other than proprietary interests or what we
                            traditionally understand as interests in land. If a caveator’s
                            interest in the sale proceeds of land came about only by way of an
                            attempt to enforce a monetary judgment with no other connection
                            whatsoever to the property, such an interest would be outlawed by the
                            delimiting words in section 115(3)(a). It would appear from these words
                            that you cannot seek to encumber the titles of registered land by
                            lodging caveats when all that you have against the registered proprietor
                            is a judgment or order for payment of money. The judgment creditor can
                            however seek enforcement of his judgment against the property of the
                            judgment debtor by applying for a writ of seizure and sale pursuant to
                            Order 47 Rule 4 of the Rules of Court and the order made thereon would
                            then be registered with the Land Titles Registry. A judgment creditor
                            would therefore have no necessity to lodge a caveat as he already has
                            the means to attach the property of the debtor and to have his interest
                            to the property notified on the register.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Considering the way section 115(3)(a) has been
                            drafted, it leads to the irresistible conclusion that there would be
                            categories of interests in proceeds of sale of land which would not come
                            within the general understanding of an interest in land. It has been
                            recognized by textbook writers that the rights covered by section
                            115(3)(a) are not really interests in land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Second, in <em>Ho Seek Yueng
                        Novel and another v J &amp; V Development Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R)
                    742 (“<em>Novel Ho</em>”), the owner of the
                    defendant company (“Mr Tan”) had caused caveats to be lodged
                    against 12 properties. He offered two bases to support the caveats. First, by
                    way of an oral agreement, he had granted the plaintiffs a loan in respect of the
                    sale and purchase of the properties. Second, under the same oral agreement, the
                    plaintiffs had granted him a right of first refusal in respect of the sale and
                    purchase of the properties. In the event that he agreed to purchase the property
                    concerned, the loan granted to the plaintiffs in respect of the said property
                    would be set off against the sale price; if he did not wish to purchase the
                    property and it was sold to a third party, the loan concerned would then be
                    repaid by the plaintiffs from the sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The High Court accepted Mr Tan’s version
                    of events and held that both the loan agreement and the right of first refusal
                    independently conferred on Mr Tan a caveatable interest in the properties.
                    Unfortunately, although the court devoted a large amount of space to explaining
                    why the right of first refusal gave rise to a caveatable interest, there was
                    relatively little analysis of why the <em>loan</em> created
                    such an interest as well. The court simply stated as follows (at
                    [38]–[39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    As already alluded to above, the first legal issue
                            is whether or not the loan extended by the defendant to the plaintiffs
                            gave rise to an interest in land that was caveatable under the
                            LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    The defendant's interest in this regard would be in
                            the sale proceeds and this is clearly an interest in land that is
                            caveatable under the LTA. This is in fact <em>expressly
                                provided for</em> under s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) of the LTA, which was also referred to by counsel for
                            the defendant in his closing submissions. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Abdul Hamid</em>,
                    there was an express assignment of the future sale proceeds to the caveator. In
                        <em>Novel Ho</em>, however, there was no mention of any
                    assignment and Mr Tan’s right to the sale proceeds appears to be purely
                    contractual in nature. The proposition that a <em>personal</em> right to the repayment of a debt can create a
                    caveatable interest within the meaning of s 115(3)(<em>a</em>) sits uneasily with the original object and purpose of that
                    section (which I have set out earlier). This was pointed out in William J M
                    Ricquier, <em>Land Law</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2007) at p
                    127, where the learned author made the following observation on the decision in
                        <em>Novel Ho</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the first holding, regarding the loan, that perhaps raises more
                        questions. Much depends on what is mean[t] by ‘an interest in the
                        proceeds of sale’ in s 115(3)(a). On the face of it, it means a
                        proprietary interest. A beneficiary under a trust for sale has an interest
                        in the proceeds of sale because of the equitable doctrine of conversion. A
                        foreign person who inherits residential property – which has to be
                        sold pursuant to the provisions of the Residential Property Act – has
                        an interest in the proceeds of sale thereof. Mr Tan’s
                        ‘interest’ in the proceeds of sale of the Geylang properties
                        looks more like a personal, contractual claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Admittedly, there is a trend in our courts
                    towards allowing non-proprietary interests to be caveated. One example is a
                    right of first refusal (also known as a right of pre-emption). The prevailing
                    judicial opinion is that such a right is purely contractual in nature at the
                    time of its grant: see the survey of this area of law in <em>Novel Ho</em> at [51]–[56]; see also <em>Ong
                        Chay Tong &amp; Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo Eng</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 305
                        (“<em>Ong Chay Tong</em>”) at [79] and
                    [83]. However, the High Court in <em>Novel Ho</em> and the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Ong Chay Tong</em> have held that a
                    right of first refusal is an interest in land that can sustain a caveat. A key
                    rationale for this holding is that land is unique, so that certain interests in
                    land, although not proprietary in nature, are also deserving of protection by
                    the caveat machinery. As pointed out in <em>Novel Ho</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It must also be emphasised at this juncture that the subject
                        matter involved is <em>land or real property</em> and,
                        given the uniqueness of land, the holder of a right of first refusal might
                        well consider a contractual remedy in damages to be inadequate –
                        hence, the possible remedy of an injunction or even specific performance
                        … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The reasoning was approved by the court in <em>Ong
                        Chay Tong</em> (at [79]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In particular, we agree with Phang J that such an approach would
                        be consistent with the purpose and function of a caveat, and that <em>it would be fair, logical and commonsensical to allow a person
                            with a pre-emption right over </em><b><em>a defined

                        pre-emption right is defeated by the stealth assignment of the legal
                        interest or by way of s 49 of the LTA without the holder of the right
                        having first the opportunity to invoke the court process to give effect to
                        his right. While such a conclusion might at first blush be interpreted by
                        some as giving undue "proprietary" reach to a "personal" right, we should
                        nevertheless be mindful of the fact that a contractual restraint on land has
                        long been recognised as one that is susceptible to injunctive relief ...
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     But where a person is claiming an interest in
                    the <em>sale proceeds</em> of land, his interest is purely
                    monetary in nature and I can see no reason why, bearing in mind the original
                    object and purpose of s 115(3)(a), the requirement of a proprietary interest
                    should not apply strictly in such a case. To hold that a person with a mere
                    contractual right to be paid from the sale proceeds of a property can lodge a
                    caveat on that property would effectively allow such agreements to function as a
                    form of quasi-security, since the caveatee would be unable to register dealings
                    in respect of the property until he pays up. This is not a purpose of the caveat
                    mechanism; a caveat is meant to protect pre-existing interests in land, not
                    operate in and of itself as a form of quasi-security for otherwise unsecured
                    debts. If a moneylender wishes to take security over a borrower’s
                    property, he should take a mortgage or a charge. Moreover, it would create an
                    anomaly whereby a creditor who has a contractual right to have a loan repaid out
                    of the sale proceeds of property may lodge a caveat on the basis of his
                    contractual claim, but a creditor who successfully sues the debtor on the same
                    contract (so that his claim is extinguished by the judgment and merged into the
                    latter) may not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This is another area of law raising difficult
                    issues that might merit re-examination in the future. Once again, however, I
                    need not decide them definitively because I find that the Loan Documents did not
                    confer any legal, equitable or even contractual interest in the sale proceeds.
                    Even if they did, any interest acquired by the Defendant has already been
                    extinguished by the Syariah Court Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The effect of the Loan Documents </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I turn now to the issue of how the Loan
                    Documents should be interpreted. I have already set out all the relevant terms
                    at [6]–[7] above; there are no other terms or notes in the loan documents
                    which say anything about a caveat or the sale proceeds of the Property. I should
                    also mention that in the note of contract for the 2nd Loan, section I(g) titled
                    “Details of security (if any)” was left blank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Before I go on to examine the relevant terms,
                    it is necessary to consider several instructive cases. First, in <em>Troncone and others v Aliperti and others</em> (1994) 6 BPR
                    13,291 (“<em>Troncone</em>”), the Court of
                    Appeal of New South Wales had to consider the effect of a clause
                    (“CL5”) in a loan agreement stating: “The Debtor authorises
                    the Creditors to lodge a Caveat on any property owned by the Debtors (sic) to
                    protect his interest.” There was no other clause in the agreement
                    providing for any security for the repayment of the loan. Nonetheless, the court
                    held that CL5 was effective in creating a caveatable interest. Mahoney JA
                    reasoned as follows (at 13,292):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was, in my opinion, the clear intention of the parties that the
                        creditors should have from Mr Aliperti the authority "to lodge a caveat on
                        any property owned by" him. In my opinion, CL5, on its proper construction
                        authorised the person or persons described in the relevant agreement as "the
                        Creditors" to lodge a caveat to protect the interest of that creditor or
                        creditors. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is a fundamental principle of construction that
                            "Whoever grants a thing is deemed also to grant that without which the
                            grant itself would be of no effect"</em> ("Cuicunque aliquis quid
                        concedit concedere videtur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potuit"):
                        Broome's Legal Maxims (9th ed) at 307. The principle is said to go back at
                        least to Shepherds Touchstone 89.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A caveat cannot be entered against land unless the caveator has the
                        relevant proprietary interest in the land: see Real Property Act 1900,
                        s74F(1) ("a legal or equitable estate or interest in land"). <em>Therefore, unless there be evident an intention to the
                            contrary, the grant to the creditors of an authority to lodge a caveat
                            on the relevant property carried with it by implication such an estate
                            or interest in land as was necessary to enable that authority to be
                            exercised.</em> There was, in the present case, no intention to
                        the contrary. Indeed, it might be thought to involve deception or worse if
                        Mr Aliperti had intended to authorise the lodgment of a caveat but to
                        withhold the creation of the interest in the land necessary for that to be
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     However, in <em>The Asiatic
                        Enterprises (Pte) Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R)
                    976 (“<em>Asiatic</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    held that Singapore’s LTA was different and declined to follow <em>Troncone</em> and other Australian authorities in the same
                    vein. In <em>Asiatic</em>, the Court of Appeal had to
                    consider the effect of the following clause (at [3]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the occurrence of any of the following events of default (i) the Bank
                        [the respondent] shall cease to be under any further commitment to you [the
                        appellant] and all outstandings under the entire credit line ('the
                        Outstandings') shall become due and payable immediately; (ii) the Bank
                        shall, in addition to the rights set out herein, be entitled (as equitable
                        chargee) to attach the Outstandings to any property of yours (whether real
                        or personal) and to lodge a caveat against any real property that may now or
                        hereafter be registered in your name whether singly or jointly ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The court held that this clause did not create a charge or any
                    interest in land that was capable of supporting a caveat, for the following
                    reasons (at [28]–[29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In our opinion, a
                            caveat is premised on a certain estate or interest in land which the
                            caveator claims. The respondent could not claim an interest in the
                            appellant's registered land as an equitable chargee, if at all, until
                            the occurrence of an event of default, and in that event it exercised
                            its right under cl 10 of the Standard Terms to take a charge over such
                            property. On the approach contended by counsel, such an interest would
                            arise at the point in time when the respondent lodged the caveats
                            against the properties on 9 July 1998, as that act constituted the
                            exercise of its option. However, the statutory framework relating to the
                            lodgement of caveats presupposes that the respondent already had a
                            pre-existing claim to an equitable charge over the properties which
                            supported the caveats it lodged on that day. This "paradox" was
                            demonstrated clearly by Ashley J in <em>Chiodo</em>
                            at 11 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The conclusion reached by Handley JA that 'the action of the lender in
                            lodging the caveat operated as an exercise of its option to attach its
                            debt to the subject property, and create an equitable charge over that
                            property', has been described (see 68 ALJ at 752) as involving a
                            paradox. It is this: <em>assuming that an equitable
                                charge over land, without more, is a sufficient estate or interest
                                in land to sustain a caveat lodged under s 89(1) of the [Transfer of
                                Land Act 1958], the language of the subsection assumes the existence
                                of the interest antecedent to lodgment</em>. But here,
                            according to the reasoning of Handley JA, the lodging of the caveat was
                            a necessary step in the creation of the equitable interest that the
                            lodgment in turn was intended to protect. There was not, antecedent to
                            lodgment, an estate or interest in land capable of attracting the
                            operation of s 89(1). Such an estate or interest ... arose
                            contemporaneously with lodgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    
              <em>On the basis of the statutory
                                framework, it is impossible, in terms of chronology, for the
                                lodgement of a caveat to be the act which also gives rise to the
                                claim to an interest in land needed to support the same
                                caveat.</em> In our judgment, the act of lodging a caveat by a
                            caveator does not have the effect of creating that interest in land for
                            which the caveat was lodged. The Act does not contemplate such an act as
                            creating an interest in land.</p>

                    Australia. In <em>Bellissimo v JCL Investments Pty Ltd</em>
                    [2009] NSWSC 1260, the Supreme Court of New South Wales had to consider the
                    effect of the following clause (at [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the company J C L INVESTMENTS PTY LTD hereby consents to Francesco

                    [12]), White J held that the clause did <em>not</em> give
                    rise to a caveatable interest. He reasoned as follows (at [17], [18] and
                    [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Had it been intended to create a charge, whereby

                            nature of that arrangement to be spelled out clearly in an agreement
                            between a solicitor and his client, or between a solicitor and a company
                            associated with the client, and not be left to
                        implication.</p>

                            consent. Such a negative covenant does not create an interest in land

                        held on trust for it. Nor is there mention of any agreement to repay the 2nd

                        sale proceeds of the Property. But this presupposes that the Defendant has
                        an interest in the sale proceeds in the first place. Since there is nothing
                        else in the loan documents which confers on the Defendant such an interest,
                        there is nothing for a caveat to secure. As held in <em>Asiatic</em> at [29], the act of lodging a caveat cannot in
                        itself create the interest that is supposed to support the
                    caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Therefore, the Defendant does not have a
                    caveatable interest in the Property, and the Caveat ought to be
                removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds has been
                extinguished</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Even if my analysis above is incorrect and the
                    Loan Documents were effective in conferring on the Defendant a caveatable
                    interest in the Property, there is, in my judgment, another reason why the
                    Caveat ought to be removed: the Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds
                    have been extinguished by the Syariah Court Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Assuming that the Loan Documents granted the
                    Defendant an interest in the sale proceeds of the Property, they could only have
                    given the Defendant an interest in <em>Zam’s</em>
                    share of the sale proceeds, since the Plaintiff did not sign the Loan Documents.
                    The Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds was therefore contingent on
                    Zam being entitled to sell the Property and receive proceeds therefrom. But
                    under the Syariah Court Order, Zam was ordered to transfer his interest in the
                    Property to the Plaintiff for no consideration (see [10] above). Thus, a sale of
                    the Property by Zam is no longer possible, and even if the Plaintiff decides to
                    sell it, Zam would have no entitlement to the sale proceeds. The
                    Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds is correspondingly extinguished
                    and there is no basis for allowing the Caveat to remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In this regard, one must keep in mind that a
                    caveat is “nothing more than [a] statutory injunction to keep the
                    property in status quo until the court has had an opportunity of discovering
                    what are the rights of the parties”: <em>Alrich
                        Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 598 at [37].
                    In the present case, the Caveat has served its purpose. The Property has been
                    kept in status quo while I considered what the rights of the parties were. As a
                    result of this process I have found that the Defendant never had any caveatable
                    interest in the Property or its sale proceeds, and that even if it did, this
                    interest has since been extinguished by the Syariah Court Order. Consequently,
                    the Caveat should be removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should the Caveat be removed for failure to comply with the formal
                requirements of s 115(1) of the LTA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Given my findings at [47] above, it follows
                    that the Caveat also does not satisfy the formal requirements of s 115(1) of the
                    LTA because its description (see [9] above) is erroneous. There was no agreement
                    between the Defendant and the registered proprietors of the Property that
                    Zam’s debt would be paid from the sale proceeds of the Property, nor does
                    the Defendant have any equitable interest in the sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 51 of the HDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The final issue relates to s 51 of the HDA,
                    which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     This provision was enacted precisely to
                    address cases like the present where a homeowner uses the sale proceeds of his
                    HDB flat as security or collateral for a loan. As the Minister for National
                    Development stated in Parliament (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (19 July 2010) vol 87 at cols 723,
                    725–726, (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Members may recall that in 2008, Parliament approved the Moneylenders Bill
                        to revamp the regulatory regime for moneylenders. The purpose was to
                        introduce a more flexible and progressive approach to the regulation of
                        moneylending to keep pace with the modern credit economy. Following
                        this, the number of moneylenders licences has increased
                        significantly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the same time, there has been an increasing number of HDB flat owners
                        borrowing from moneylenders and agreeing to assign the sales proceeds from
                        their flats as repayment. These moneylenders then lodge caveats against
                        the flats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds.   In 2008, there
                        were 12 registered resale applications with caveats lodged by
                        moneylenders.  In 2009, the figure increased to 546. In the six
                        months of this year alone, there were 556 such cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While this is permitted under the current legislative framework, the
                        Government is concerned about this trend as it undermines the intention of
                        the home ownership policy which seeks to provide a home for our people for
                        long-term stay.   </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, under the current rules, moneylenders can enter into an agreement
                        with the HDB flat owners for the sales proceeds to be assigned to them as
                        repayment of debt, upon which the moneylenders then lodge caveats against
                        the flats. Such caveats enable the moneylender to determine repayment owed
                        before he agrees to withdraw the caveat to allow the sale transaction of the
                        flat to go through.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The problem is that once the flat seller has sold off his flat and repaid
                        the moneylender, he cannot afford to purchase his next flat. The flat seller
                        and the other flat occupiers become homeless and pose a burden to their
                        family and friends for their housing needs and some join HDB's queue for
                        rental flats, when they in fact do not qualify for rental housing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Against this context, we have decided to go one step further now and
                        disallow the lodging of caveats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds
                        of the flat. And this is the focus of the Housing and Development
                        (Amendment) Bill 2010 that is before this House now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, section 51 of the Housing and Development Act only provides
                        that the title deeds of HDB flats cannot be used to create a security for
                        debt. Section 51 does not prevent moneylenders from lodging caveats to claim
                        an interest in the sales proceeds, after providing a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 5 of the Bill repeals the existing section 51 and re-enacts the
                        section. It continues to disallow HDB flat owners from using their HDB flat
                        as security or collateral for any debt, or obligation, or claim. One key
                        difference with this new clause is that this prohibition now includes the
                        sales proceeds from the HDB flat. The re-enacted section 51 also implements
                        a new rule that voids any contract or agreement to use HDB flats, including
                        the sales proceeds, as security or collateral. The changes do not affect
                        banks and financial institutions, who can continue to grant loans on the
                        security of the flat for the purpose of financing its purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Besides providing that any contract using the HDB flat as security for
                        debt is null and void, the Bill also provides that any Act, deed, instrument
                        or document which protects rights under such a contract has no effect. This
                        means that caveats against HDB flats for the payment of debt can no longer
                        be lodged after the Bill is enacted. <em>Existing contracts
                            with valid caveats lodged would not be affected. This is in recognition
                            of the sanctity of contracts that are already legally entered
                            into.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Section 51 of the HDA thus appears to supply a
                    complete answer to the present case, and the Plaintiff did indeed attempt to
                    rely on it. The spanner in the works is that it only came into force on 11
                    August 2010. It therefore does not affect the agreement for the 2nd Loan which
                    was concluded on 21 October 2009. Nevertheless, as explained earlier, I have
                    held that the Caveat should be removed for other reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the foregoing reasons, I allow the
                    Plaintiff’s application and order that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Caveat lodged by the Defendant
                        against the Property be removed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Registrar of the Supreme Court be empowered to
                        execute any and all documents on the Defendant’s behalf to enable the
                        Caveat to be removed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Defendant to be restrained from lodging further
                        caveats against the Property in respect of the 2nd
                Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of
                    these proceedings to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
