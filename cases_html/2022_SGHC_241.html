Section 2(1) of the POA makes clear that a demonstration by a person alone for a prohibited purpose falls within the meaning of “assembly”. Further, the appellant demonstrated support for the views and actions of Xu and De Costa as well as his opposition to the State in prosecuting them for their actions, which fell within the ambit of the proscribed purposes set out under s 2(1) of the POA.

Pertinently, the appellant had applied to hold an assembly outside the State Courts to mark “Human Rights Day” (“the Application”) but was denied permission on 5 December 2018. He additionally appealed to the Minister for Home Affairs for permission to hold a “one person assembly outside the State Courts” which would “last no more than [five] minutes” (“the Appeal”).

He carefully deliberated when, where and how to broadcast his opposition to the Attorney-General’s Chambers. He also took efforts to broadcast his actions by making the Post. The appellant’s antecedents for similar offences were not taken into consideration; at the time he committed the present offence, the appellant had yet to be convicted of the said antecedents. Finally, the DJ considered that the sentence broadly cohered with the sentence of a fine of $3,000 meted out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yan Jun</span> [2016] SGMC 24 (“<span class="font-italic">Yan Jun</span>”).

This was supported by the fact that the appellant had unsuccessfully submitted at least eight applications for permits under the POA to hold assemblies or processions at various locations, including the State Courts, between 2010 and 2018 (which included the Application), and also made the Appeal. Alternatively, the appellant had constructive knowledge by virtue of the fact that the Order was published in the Gazette.

This was, in any event, made clear by the definition of “assembly” under s 2(1) of the POA (see [19] above) as well as s 3(2) of the POA which provides that “[a] reference to a person or persons taking part in an assembly … shall include, as the case may be, a person carrying on a demonstration by himself … for any such purpose referred to in the definitions of an assembly … in section 2(1)”. The crux of the present dispute was whether an assembly under s 15(2) of the POA must be a gathering or meeting which poses a risk to public order and/or public safety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The purposive interpretation of a legislative provision involves three steps (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37]–[53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  First, the court should ascertain possible interpretations of the provision, having regard to the text of the provision as well as the context of the provision within the written law as a whole. This is done by determining the ordinary meaning of the words and could be aided by rules and canons of statutory construction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should ascertain the legislative purpose of the statute. Legislative purpose should ordinarily be gleaned from the text itself. Extraneous material may be considered in the situations set out under s 9A(2) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IA”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court should compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purpose of the statute. An interpretation which furthered the purpose of the written text was to be preferred to one which did not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Applying these principles, I found that an “assembly” under s 15(2) of the POA is not limited to gatherings or meetings which pose a risk to public order and/or public safety. It follows that there was no basis to interpret s 15(2) of the POA as requiring an individual’s actions to pose more than a <span class="font-italic">de</span><span class="font-italic"> minimis</span> risk to public order and/or public safety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 To begin, the plain wording of the definition of “assembly” under s 2(1) of the POA makes no mention of a requirement for a gathering or meeting to pose a risk to public order and/or public safety. Instead, s 2(1) of the POA expressly defines an “assembly” with respect to its purpose. If the purpose or one of the purposes of a gathering or meeting falls within the statutorily enumerated purposes, that gathering or meeting constitutes an assembly. The appellant’s proposed interpretation of “assembly” reads into the provision limits that are not linguistically provided for. For this reason, I found that it was not a possible interpretation of “assembly” (as the word is deployed in the POA) and therefore falls at the first step of the <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The purpose of the POA, as revealed in its name and its long title, is to preserve and maintain public order (<span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span>”) at [39]). But this did not, in any way, advance the appellant’s case. Purposive interpretation, while an important and powerful tool, is not a basis for rewriting a statute. Judicial interpretation is generally confined to giving a statutory provision a meaning that its language can bear and must be done with a view toward determining the provision’s purpose and object as reflected by and in harmony with the express wording of the legislation (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The parliamentary debates on the Public Order Bill (Bill No 8/2009) (“the Bill”) – through which Parliament promulgated the Public Order Act 2009 (Act 15 of 2009) – confirmed that s 2(1) of the POA sets out a teleological definition of an “assembly”. During the second reading of the Bill, then Second Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam explained that under the POA, “cause-based activities are regulated” and the Act “applies only to cause-based activities”. Likewise, then Member of Parliament for Hong Kah Group Representation Constituency, Mr Alvin Yeo, observed that the POA “provides a separate framework for regulating assemblies and processions which are organised for the purpose of promoting a cause or campaign” and it is “the crucial definition of the purpose behind the activity, which makes it cause-related and hence subject to regulation” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (13 April 2009) vol 85 at cols 3664, 3679–3680, 3744). In delineating what constitutes an “assembly” under the POA, Parliament’s focus was on the purpose animating a gathering or meeting, rather than its effects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Finally, to read a requirement that a gathering or meeting poses a risk to public order and/or public safety before it may be considered an assembly sits uncomfortably with the permit regime set out in ss 5 to 11 of the POA. I am cognisant that the permit regime was not directly relevant to the appellant’s offence; his offence under s 15(2) of the POA concerned an assembly in a public place where the holding of public assemblies is prohibited by order published in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span> (see s 12 of the POA). That said, the POA adopts a single definition of “assembly” that is employed in the rest of the act, such as in s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which proscribes the organising of a public assembly or public procession in respect of which no permit has been granted or no such permit is in force. Hence, the extent to which the appellant’s proposed interpretation of “assembly” undermines the operation and logic of the permit regime was, in my view, a relevant consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In this regard, the POA regulates which assemblies require a permit and the grounds for refusing to grant such a permit where a permit is required (<span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham (CA)</span> at [16]). Section 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POA provides that upon receiving any notice and application under s 6 of the POA for a permit in respect of a proposed public assembly or public procession, the Commissioner of Police (“the Commissioner”) may refuse to grant a permit if he has reasonable ground for apprehending that the proposed assembly or procession may occasion public disorder, or damage to public or private property. The word “occasion” – particularly when deployed in conjunction with the clause “damage to public or private property” – suggests that the Commissioner has to consider whether the proposed assembly may <span class="font-italic">result in</span> public disorder. If so, then the appellant’s proposed interpretation leads to an illogical position, namely, that while an “assembly” invariably causes public disorder, the Commissioner must consider if the assembly may result in public disorder in deciding whether to refuse to grant a permit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There was accordingly no scope to interpret an “assembly” under the POA as being limited to a gathering or meeting which poses a risk to public order and/or public safety, much less one which, additionally, poses more than a <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>risk to public order and/or public safety. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the appellant had actual knowledge that holding the assembly was prohibited by an order under s 12(1) of the POA  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Moving on, I deal with the appellant’s contention that the DJ erred in finding that the appellant had actual knowledge that holding the assembly was prohibited by an order under s 12(1) of the POA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The appellant’s submissions in this regard were two-fold. It should be recalled that the Commissioner had, on 5 December 2018, denied the appellant permission to hold up placards outside the State Courts for five minutes on 9 December 2018 to mark Human Rights Day and raise awareness of human rights issues (see [9] above). The appellant first contended that his acts which formed the subject of the present charge were “a far cry” from what he planned and was denied permission to do on 9 December 2018 and he thus did not know that he required a permit to perform the former acts. Second, the appellant submitted that it was not unreasonable for him to believe that no permit was required for taking a “quick photograph” outside the State Courts.

His offence under s 15(2) of the POA related to his knowledge that the assembly was prohibited by an order under s 12(1) of the POA. This was distinct from the question of whether the appellant believed that he did not require a permit to perform the acts subject of the charge. The appellant failed to show how his purported belief that he did not require a permit to perform the acts which formed the subject of the charge impinged upon the DJ’s finding that he knew the assembly was prohibited by an order under s 12(1) of the POA, which was the relevant inquiry for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appeal against sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Finally, I consider the appeal against sentence.

In respect of the former offence, the offender stood directly opposite the main gate of the Istana and held two placards, which broadly disparaged judicial independence in Singapore, above his shoulders for approximately four minutes.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It must be remembered, however, that the role of the appellate court differs from that of a court sentencing an offender at first instance. Appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is only warranted when the sentence “requires substantial alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice” (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22]). Additionally, due to the extraordinary range of possible factual circumstances, attempts to narrowly distinguish sentencing precedents are ordinarily not very helpful and may sometimes lead to missing the wood for the trees (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Leong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 63 at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The threshold for appellate intervention was not met in the present case. Even if I disregarded the Post, I found the Sentence to be supported by the subject-matter of the assembly, namely, to express opposition to the Public Prosecutor’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion and that the appellant intended for the assembly coincide in time and place with Xu and De Costa’s court proceedings. Moreover, the DJ declined to place weight on the fact that the appellant had committed the present offence while on bail and under investigations for offences under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POA when this was, in my view, an aggravating factor that could have featured in the sentencing calculus. The DJ declined to do so on the basis that there was “no final definitive superior court ruling … as to the proper applicability of the POA” at the time the appellant committed the present offence.
