<strong>
<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1.

        The plaintiff was medically unfit to attend at

a hearing before me. A practising lawyer came in his place with instructions to argue the

matter for him. The lawyer did not come as the plaintiff’s counsel, but as his

friend.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        When the plaintiff commenced this action

against the defendant bank a law corporation acted for him. The law corporation filed the

cause papers and represented him in the interlocutory hearings and the first tranche of

hearing between 26 February 2002 and 15 March 2002. The solicitor-client relationship did

not last. On 15 June 2002 the plaintiff filed a notice that he was acting in person. Then

on 8 July 2002, a law firm, Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners filed a notice that it had been

appointed to act for him in place of the law corporation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        On 15 July 2002, an application by the

defendant for interrogatories served by the plaintiff to be withdrawn came on for hearing.

The plaintiff came to the hearing with Mr Goh Aik Leng and Mr Mohan Singh, a practising

lawyer from another firm. At the outset, Mr Goh informed me that the plaintiff was still a

litigant in person. Mr Goh described himself as the solicitor on record whose function was

to file documents for the plaintiff and to accept service of documents on his behalf,

while the plaintiff present arguments himself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        I was not persuaded that a party who has

appointed counsel to act for him can consider himself to be a litigant in person and

retain the right to argue his case himself. I stood down the matter for the plaintiff and

Mr Goh to consider the matter. When the hearing resumed, they decided that the plaintiff

would continue with the argument. Mr Goh withdrew as solicitor, but remained to assist the

plaintiff while he presented the arguments himself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        On 22 July, the action came on for continued

hearing scheduled to go on to 30 August 2002. However the plaintiff was not in court. Mr

Goh appeared and informed me that the plaintiff was in hospital undergoing medical tests.

Mr Mohan Singh was also present, and Mr Goh introduced him as the co-counsel of the

plaintiff.<sup>1</sup> However Mr Mohan Singh was unsure whether he could be a co-counsel

to a litigant in person, and wanted to give further thought to that.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Mr Goh raised the question of his own status

again. He applied that he be accorded the right of audience as the plaintiff’s

friend. He took pains to state that he was not claiming any right by himself as a

"McKenzie friend" because he acknowledged on the authority of <i>R v Leicester

City Justices Ex parte Barrow </i>[1991] 2 QB 260 that he cannot claim the right himself.<sup>2</sup>

He submitted on the authority of that case<i> </i>that "(I)n the light of [the

plaintiff’s] health and the complexity of the case, he is entitled to appoint me as

his friend and he is also entitled to instruct me to speak on his behalf."<sup>3</sup>

and that the plaintiff had a choice to present his case himself, personally or to have a

friend present it on his behalf.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The application was adjourned for further

hearing on 24 July. When hearing resumed, Mr Goh returned alone. He informed me that Mr

Mohan Singh had withdrawn from further participation in the case. The arguments on Mr

Goh’s right to argue the case on the plaintiff’s behalf continued. After hearing

the submissions, I ruled that Mr Goh cannot present arguments for the plaintiff as his

friend.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The plaintiff now appeals against this order by

a notice of appeal filed by Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners as his solicitors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        The McKenzie friend takes his name from the

case <i>McKenzie v McKenzie</i> [1970] 3 All ER 1034. This was a divorce case heard in

England. The husband Mr McKenzie was not represented by counsel, but Mr Hanger, an

Australian barrister was in court with him. Mr Hanger had been attached to a firm of

solicitors which acted for the husband previously, and he attended the hearing to assist

him to conduct his case. However the trial judge did not allow him to do that.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        The husband who was left to fend for himself in

the hearing appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judge’s decision. The Court

allowed the appeal. Davies LJ referred to Lord Tenterden’s statement in <i>Collier v

Hicks</i> (1831) 2 B &amp; Ad 663 that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Any person, whether he be a

    professional man or not, may attend as a friend of either party, may take notes, may

    quietly make suggestions, and give advice, but no one can demand to take part in the

    proceedings as an advocate, contrary to the regulations of the court as settled by the

    discretion of the justice.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and held that Mr Hanger should

not have been excluded because</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Hanger was not there to take

    part in the proceedings in any sort of way. He was merely there to prompt and to make

    suggestions to the husband in the conduct of his case, the calling of his witnesses and,

    perhaps more importantly, on the very critical and difficult questions of fact in this

    case, to assist him by making suggestions as to the cross-examination of the wife and her

    witnesses.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        Sachs LJ agreed with Davies LJ noting that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mr Hanger, … had done

    nothing, so far as this court has been able to ascertain, other than sit quietly beside

    the husband and give him from time to time some quiet advice or prompting. In those

    circumstances, the husband was fully entitled to have that assistance, and Mr Hanger was

    fully entitled to give it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        Counsel also referred me to <i>R v Leicester

City Justices Ex parte Barrow</i> [1991] 2 QB 260. This case arose from summonses issued

for the non-payment of community charges or poll tax in England, a matter of considerable

controversy at that time. The defendants on whom summonses were issued were not

represented. In the place of counsel, they wanted Mr John, a member of the Anti-Poll Tax

Federation to assist them in their defence. Their request was refused.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        Their appeal to the Divisional Court also

failed. It then went to the Court of Appeal which reversed the Divisional Court’s

decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        Lord Donaldson expressed reservations over the

use of the term "McKenzie friend", but was clear in his views of the role such a

person performs at a hearing. He said (at pp 285-6)</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">References to "McKenzie

    friends" and still more to a "right to a McKenzie friend" mislead, because

    they suggest that someone who seeks to assist a litigant in person has a special status

    akin to, if less than, that of one who has a right of audience or a right to conduct

    litigation. The "McKenzie friend" does not exist at all as such and has neither

    status nor rights. The only right is that of the litigant and his right is to reasonable

    assistance which can take many forms. If he is blind, he may need someone to read

    documents to him, if he is hard of hearing, he may need someone sitting next to him who

    can make a note so that he can read what he cannot hear. The possibilities, if not

    endless, are at least extensive.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and elaborated that (at pp 289)</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A party to proceedings has a

    right to present his own case and in so doing to arm himself with such assistance as he

    thinks appropriate, subject to the right of the court to intervene. … If he wishes to

    have an adviser, as contrasted with an advocate, it is convenient that he should mention

    this fact to the justices or to their clerk in order that they may know why the person

    concerned is sitting next to the defendant, rather than in the space reserved for the

    general public. But if a party arms himself with assistance in order the better himself to

    present his case, it is not a question of seeking the leave of the court. It is a question

    of the court objecting and restricting him in the use of this assistance, if it is clearly

    unreasonable in nature or degree or if it becomes apparent that the "assistance"

    is not being provided bona fide, but for an improper purpose or is being provided in a way

    which is inimical to the proper and efficient administration of justice by, for example,

    causing the party to waste time, advising the introduction of irrelevant issues or the

    asking of irrelevant or repetitious questions.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        Staughton LJ also agreed that Mr John should

have been allowed to remain to assist the defendants. He said (at p 290)</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In my opinion there are in

    general no grounds for objecting to a litigant in person being accompanied by an

    assistant, who will sit beside him, take notes and advise sotto voce on the conduct of his

    case. If the court is open to the public, the assistant is entitled to be present in his

    own right provided that there is room; and if the litigant wishes him as an assistant, he

    should be accorded priority over the public in general. Any member of the public is

    entitled to take notes. And I can see no reason why a litigant in person should not, if he

    wishes, receive quiet and unobtrusive advice from a member of the public.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        I should also mention <i>R v Bow County Court

Ex parte Pelling</i> [1999] 1 WLR 1807, another decision of the English Court of Appeal.

The Court was dealing with the role of a McKenzie friend again. The applicant before the

court was not the party who was denied the assistance of a friend, but the intended friend

Dr Pelling, a campaigner for the rights of fathers and their children in family disputes.

He applied to quash an order which refused him permission to appear as a McKenzie friend

in family proceedings in chambers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        The Court saved the McKenzie friend from

extinction when it elected to retain that description despite the views expressed in <i>Leicester

City Justices</i>. Lord Woolf MR reviewed the authorities on the McKenzie friend and found

(at p 1824)</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) that the authorities lay down

    that a McKenzie friend has personally no rights with regard to litigation, it is the

    litigants who have the right;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) that a McKenzie friend has

    no right to be an advocate;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) that both in proceedings in

    chambers and in proceedings in open court, the court has a discretion to exclude a

    McKenzie friend;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv) that the difference between

    the position in open court and in chambers is one of degree.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">and he added (at p 1825) that

"(a) litigant in person has an entitlement to be heard and if he or she needs

assistance for this purpose, then the court should not unless there is reason deprive that

person of that assistance." I respectfully agree with those views.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        A McKenzie friend who takes his

responsibilities seriously is a help not only to the litigant who seeks his assistance,

but also to the court. He should be permitted to stay. On the other hand, one who abuses

the privilege by disregarding the directions of the court, who pursues an agenda beyond

helping the litigant, or who uses the privilege as a back door to a legal practice he is

not qualified for should not be allowed to carry on.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Reverting to the present case, Mr Goh was not

seeking permission to be present to take notes for the plaintiff, or to whisper into his

ear during the hearing. He intended to argue by himself. If he had continued he was going

to be in complete charge, making the arguments, responding to the submissions of the

defendants’ counsel and to the court, and do everything an advocate would do, while

the plaintiff is absent. That goes beyond a McKenzie friend’s role. Mr Goh can assist

the plaintiff when the latter conducts his case, but he cannot be the advocate for the

plaintiff who elects to be a litigant in person.</font></p>
