<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Walton International Group
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the company”), terminated the employment of
                    the defendant, Ms Sharon Loh Pui-Pui (“Ms Loh”), its former
                    Vice-President, Sales, on 29 May 2008 and sued her for breach of her
                    employment contract, breach of fiduciary duty owed to the company and unlawful
                    interference with its trade. Ms Loh denied having breached her employment
                    contract or her fiduciary duty to the company. She also denied having unlawfully
                    interfered with the company’s trade and counterclaimed for damages for
                    wrongful dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 1 November 2005, Ms Loh was employed by
                    the company, which is a part of the Walton group of companies. The
                    company’s primary business is the sale of Walton’s landbanking
                    products. As Vice-President, Sales, Ms Loh was in charge of more than 500
                    staff in the retail sales division. Under her charge, the company’s retail
                    sales in Singapore improved steadily despite problems within the company. In
                    2007, she was paid more than $1.5 million by the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 29 May 2008, the company summarily dismissed
                    Ms Loh. On 30 June 2008, Ms Loh’s then solicitors,
                    M/s Alban Tay Mahtani &amp; de Silva LLP (“ATMD”), wrote to
                    the company’s solicitors, and asserted that her employment had been
                    wrongfully terminated. ATMD demanded that the company pay Ms Loh the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">One month’s base salary until 30 June
                            2008;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Basic Management Override (1% of Singapore sales)
                            until 20 June 2008; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bonus Management Override (0.65% of Singapore
                            sales) until 30 June 2008.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After receiving ATMD’s letter of demand,
                    the company, which refused to pay Ms Loh the amount claimed, instituted
                    proceedings against her and sought to claim back the salary, overrides and
                    management bonuses paid to her from the date she allegedly breached her
                    employment contract at the end of January 2008 to the time she was dismissed on
                    29 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       To understand why Ms Loh’s employment
                    was abruptly terminated, reference may be made to another suit, namely Suit
                    No 333 of 2008 (“Suit No 333”), by the Walton group of
                    companies against two of its former senior executives, Mr Winston Yau
                    (“Mr Yau”), and Mr James Iseli
                    (“Mr Iseli”). In that suit, the Walton group accused
                    Mr Yau, formerly one of its top officers in Singapore, and Mr Iseli, a
                    former senior sales staff in Walton Malaysia, of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, conspiring to create fear and uncertainty among the Walton
                    group’s employees in Singapore and Malaysia by fuelling rumours that the
                    majority of them would soon be made redundant as a result of the group’s
                    alleged “corporatisation” business strategy. The defendants in
                    that suit were also accused of soliciting the staff of the company and Walton
                    Malaysia, malicious falsehood, interfering with the trade of the Walton group
                    and defaming the group as well as its president and chief executive officer,
                    Mr William Kevin Doherty (“Mr Doherty”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In Suit No 333, Ms Loh was accused of
                    furthering the intentions of Mr Yau and Mr Iseli and acting against
                    the company’s interests. However, it is noteworthy that she was not a
                    defendant in that suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to Ms Loh, the proceedings in the
                    present suit were a pre-emptive move to discourage her from giving evidence in
                    favour of Mr Yau and Mr Iseli in Suit No 333. Her counsel, Mr Tan
                    Chee Meng SC (“Mr Tan”), asserted that the company’s
                    suit against her was “nothing more than a vindictive, oppressive and
                    vexatious attempt to pre-empt the possibility that [Ms Loh] would sue [the
                    company] for sums due to [her] under the terms of her contract of employment,
                    after [she] fired the first salvo by sending a letter of demand dated
                    30 June 2008”. He added that the company’s bullying tactics
                    included a failed attempt to consolidate the present action with Suit No 333 to
                    make the proceedings as painful and expensive as possible for Ms Loh, who
                    had merely claimed around US$159,717.25 from the company. He also questioned why
                    the company sued his client when Mr Gerald Thomas Foo Tiang Boo
                    (“Mr Foo”), its managing director at the material time and
                    the present chairman of Walton Asia, testified that the company had suffered no
                    loss even if she had breached her employment contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the company was entitled to dismiss Ms Loh
                summarily</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The right of the company to recover the amount
                    claimed from Ms Loh in these proceedings depends on whether it was entitled
                    to dismiss her summarily on 29 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Cowie Edward Bruce v
                        Berger International Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 739,
                    Warren Khoo J explained at [39]-[40] the right of an employer to summarily
                    dismiss an employee in the following helpful terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In each case, it is a matter of degree whether the act complained of is of
                        the requisite gravity. It has been said that it must be so serious that it
                        strikes at the root of the contract of employment, that it destroys the
                        confidence underlying such a contract: <em>Jackson v Invicta
                            Plastics</em> Ltd [1987] BCLC 329 at 344, <em>per</em> Peter Pain J.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The relevancy and effect of any misdeed complained of must, it seems to
                        me, be judged by reference to its effect on the employer-employee
                        relationship. It also seems to me that in judging the relevancy and effect
                        of the acts complained of, account must be taken of the habits and attitude
                        of the employer at the relevant time. They cannot be judged totally in a
                        vacuum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The reasons pleaded in the present proceedings
                    to justify the summary dismissal of Ms Loh were not the reasons given to
                    her when she was summarily dismissed on 29 May 2008 at a meeting with
                    Walton Asia’s chief operating officer, Mr Kent Britton
                    (“Mr Britton”), and Mr Foo, who was Ms Loh’s
                    boss. This is not fatal to the company’s case for in <em>Taylor v Oakes, Roncoroni &amp; Co</em> (1922) 127 LT 267
                    at 269, Greer J explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a long established rule of law that a contracting party, who, after
                        he has become entitled to refuse performance of his contractual obligations,
                        gives a wrong reason for his refusal, does not thereby deprive himself of a
                        justification which in fact existed, whether he was aware of it or
                        not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Although Mr Britton hummed and hawed
                    about the reasons for dismissing Ms Loh, the contemporary notes taken by
                    the company’s key personnel at the meeting showed that she had been sacked
                    for not providing information to the company about who was conspiring against
                    it. Mr Foo’s own notes of the meeting were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Mr Britton] said, “I have no other choice. You have no
                        information to offer the company. We have to move to <em>terminate</em> you with cause <em>on that
                            basis</em>. Any questions?”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The following notes prepared by the
                    company’s legal counsel, Mr Jason Toh, corroborated
                    Mr Foo’s notes:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     When Mr Britton told Ms Loh that he
                    was sacking her for misconduct and insubordination, it is more likely than not
                    that he was referring to her misconduct in not offering information to him and
                    her insubordination towards him when she insisted that she had no information
                    about the alleged misdeeds of Mr Yau. After all, other forms of misconduct
                    and insubordination were not mentioned at the said meeting. More importantly,
                    although Mr Foo initially toed the company line that Ms Loh had been
                    sacked for the reasons pleaded in the Statement of Claim, he finally conceded
                    that it was quite clear from his e-mail to Mr Doherty on 29 May 2008
                    concerning the sacking of Ms Loh that she had been sacked because she could
                    not offer useful information to the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Ms Loh’s alleged failure to furnish
                    useful information to the company was pleaded in the Statement of Claim as

                    offer about Mr Yau’s alleged wrongdoing because the company’s
                    allegations against the latter were untrue. As I found in Suit No 333 that the
                    Walton group failed to prove that Mr Yau and Mr Iseli committed the
                    alleged unlawful acts against it, it follows that Ms Loh cannot be guilty
                    of refusing to assist the Walton group by giving information of the allegedly
                    unlawful acts. In any case, Mr Britton made the following damning admission
                    about the propriety of summarily dismissing Ms Loh on the ground that she
                    had no information to offer the company when he was cross-examined: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">New reasons for dismissing Ms Loh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The company, which had plenty of time to
                    reflect on other grounds to justify the summary dismissal of Ms Loh, now
                    claimed that she breached her contract and her fiduciary duty to the company and
                    unlawfully interfered with its trade. In its Opening Statement, the company
                    alleged (at para 15) that Ms Loh’s breaches arose from the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Her presence at a Lei Garden Lunch with Winston

                            promotion.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The lunch and dinner meetings on 27 and 29 January 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The company alleged that on
                    Mr Yau’s instructions, Ms Loh organised a lunch on
                    27 January 2008 for its top DMs to meet him so that he could induce them to
                    leave the company and join him in his new business venture. It claimed that the
                    dinner meeting on 29 January 2008 was also arranged by Ms Loh to
                    achieve Mr Yau’s diabolical aim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The purpose of the lunch and dinner meetings
                    was canvassed at length in Suit No 333. In that case, I held that the
                    plaintiffs’ allegation that Mr Yau solicited the company’s DMs
                    at the lunch and dinner meetings to resign from the company was not proven. The
                    evidence was that the lunch was a birthday celebration for Mr Yau and that
                    he had encouraged the company’s DMs to work hard for Walton Singapore at
                    the lunch and dinner meetings. As such, Ms Loh’s presence at the
                    lunch and dinner meetings with Mr Yau could not be a breach of her
                    employment contract and need not be further considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The TSI presentation in Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As for Ms Loh’s presence at the
                    Hotel Equatorial in Kuala Lumpur when the TSI presentation was made, it was not
                    established to my satisfaction that she had attended the TSI presentation. In
                    Suit No 333, I found that the allegation that Mr Yau and Mr Iseli had
                    solicited Walton Malaysia’s staff to cross over to TSI at the said
                    presentation was not proven. I also found that Walton Malaysia’s staff
                    regularly attended product presentations by rival companies to get a feel of the
                    competitors’ products and that the TSI presentation was an ordinary
                    product presentation, at which no Walton Malaysia staff was offered any position
                    by TSI. In these circumstances, Ms Loh’s presence at the Hotel
                    Equatorial in Kuala Lumpur at the time of the TSI presentation cannot justify
                    her summary dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ms Loh’s lie about her whereabouts on 28 April 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Admittedly, Ms Loh lied about her
                    whereabouts on 28 April 2008 when Mr Britton telephoned her to enquire
                    about her whereabouts. Ms Loh said that she going to Labuan via Kuala
                    Lumpur to meet her boyfriend but as their plans changed, she remained in Kuala
                    Lumpur and stayed at the Hotel Equatorial, her usual hotel which gave her
                    special rates. She pointed out that as she was then on leave, there was no
                    reason why Mr Britton should be concerned about her whereabouts. She added
                    that he was rather rude and that he shouted obscenities at her. Knowing that
                    Mr Britton would be agitated if he knew that she was in Kuala Lumpur, she
                    chose to lie about her whereabouts to avoid problems. Apparently,
                    Mr Britton’s vulgarities had also upset one of Ms Loh’s
                    former colleagues, Ms Helen Chong, a Division Manager of the company at the
                    material time, to such an extent that she wrote to Mr Doherty about the
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Admittedly, Ms Loh’s answers to
                    questions by the company’s counsel, Ms Indranee Rajah SC, as to why
                    she lied about her whereabouts on 28 April 2008 were not altogether
                    satisfactory. However, as I have found in Suit No 333 that there was nothing
                    untoward about the TSI presentation, this lie by Ms Loh regarding her
                    whereabouts on 28 April 2008 was not sufficiently serious to justify her
                    summary dismissal. After all, Mr Britton, who had been fully briefed by his
                    DMs about the lunch and dinner meetings, admitted that he had also lied to
                    Ms Loh at the meeting with her on 29 May 2008 when he told her that he
                    did not know anything about these meetings and invited her to tell him about
                    these meetings. By feigning ignorance, he had hoped that Ms Loh would give
                    him some incriminating evidence against Mr Yau. Mr Britton’s
                    complaint against Ms Loh for lying to him about her whereabouts on
                    28 April 2008 was clearly a case of the pot calling the kettle
                    black.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Ms Loh had unlawfully interfered with the
                company’s trade</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When considering the company’s
                    allegations that Ms Loh had unlawfully interfered with the company’s
                    trade, it cannot be overlooked that until she was summarily dismissed on
                    29 May 2008, she had done yeoman service for the company by helping to
                    increase its sales significantly. In fact, in the 5 months before she was sacked
                    in May, her sales team had generated C$43.6 million. In the context of the
                    target for the entire year, which was only C$78 million, this was 34% above the
                    pro-rated target for that 5-month period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     When cross-examined, Ms Loh’s boss,
                    Mr Foo, said that he was very happy with her performance in so far as sales
                    of Walton products were concerned for the period January to May
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Even
                    Mr Britton accepted that Ms Loh was a star performer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mention must also be made of
                    Ms Loh’s e-mail to Mr Doherty on 26 May 2008, in which she
                    reiterated her unwavering commitment to Walton and pointed out that she was
                    saddened at being viewed with suspicion by “higher management”.
                    The relevant part of this e-mail is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bill, <em>my commitment to Walton has always been
                            unwavering. This is attested by the fact that we have been hitting
                            targets month after month since I became the VP of sales in Singapore in
                            November 2006</em>. In the recent months, despite the departure of
                        Winston and Dirk, despite the rumours and lies that has been spreading
                        around, despite the falling sales from other regions, Singapore has been
                        holding the fort. Singapore has been delivering record sales, month after
                        month since February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only reason why we have been able to achieve such results is because
                        all the divisions have been working cohesively together and contributing to
                        our sales targets. We are focussed and keep our eyes on the Goal. Once
                        higher management allows favouritism, this will cause factions among the
                        divisions. This will cause the rest of our Singapore sales team to be
                        demoralised and lose focus. Inadvertently, sales will be affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>At the same time, I feel that my higher management does
                            not seem to trust me. I am aware that I have been investigated
                            extensively</em>. They even checked my whereabouts with travel
                        agents when I went on leave. I believe this is because of my close
                        relationship with Winston and Dirk. <em>This is extremely
                            hurtful and has caused great distress as I have been doing my best for
                            the company all this while</em>. Granted, Winston and Dirk are my
                        good friends. This fact does not change although they have left Walton. I am
                        still in touch with them as friends. Should I leave Walton one day, I hope I
                        can still keep in touch with you Bill and have you as my friend
                        still.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Doherty’s immediate response to
                    Ms Loh in his e-mail on 27 May 2008 was to encourage her. He went so
                    far as to tell her that he had no objections to her being in contact with
                    Mr Yau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Ms Loh knew that she had a very lucrative
                    career with the company and had not been deterred by rumours of corporatisation
                    allegedly spread by Mr Yau because she received overriding commissions on
                    both retail and corporate sales. She added that it took her 8 years to reach her
                    position in the company and there was no reason for her to bite the hands that
                    fed her. She testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> convincingly as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There’s no reason for me … to leave Walton … - more
                        than 1-over million in pay, in commission and salary, … to
                        join… a very unstable, or if there’s any company,…
                        <em>nobody can pay me this kind of money</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     If one looks at the facts objectively, there
                    was no reason why Ms Loh, who was earning more than $1.5 million per annum,
                    would want to sabotage the company by interfering with its trade as this would
                    adversely affect her own interests. I thus find that the company did not
                    establish that Ms Loh had unlawfully interfered with its trade and cannot
                    rely on this ground to justify her summary dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged failure to motivate the staff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The company clutched at straws by also making
                    a vague claim that Ms Loh breached her duties by failing to motivate the
                    staff. Ms Loh’s boss, Mr Foo, demolished his company’s
                    case entirely by agreeing that she had not failed to motivate her staff. When
                        cross-examined,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> he stated:</p>

                    was that Ms Loh had breached her duty to address matters that could
                    adversely affect the motivation and loyalty of the sales staff, Mr Foo gave
                    the following answer:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

                    evidence that to his knowledge, Ms Loh had not failed to motivate the
                    staff. The cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> was as follows:</p>

                    allegation that Ms Loh had failed to motivate her staff need not be further

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged acts of insubordination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As for Ms Loh’s alleged acts of
                    insubordination in relation to Mr Foo, the company pleaded in its Statement
                    of Claim at para 33(c) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">At or about 5.30 pm on 22 January 2008, the
                            Defendant telephoned Gerald Foo and demanded an explanation from him as
                            to why he had agreed to certain requests made by the Division Managers,
                            which she had earlier rejected. During the conversation, she raised her
                            voice and ended the conversation abruptly by putting down the phone
                            before Gerald Foo could explain his reasons to her;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">On May 26 2008, the Defendant called Gerald Foo
                            at 2.10 am and shouted at him for allowing one of the divisions in the
                            Retail Sales Division to receive trip subsidies under an incentive
                            program, although the Division Manager had not consulted the Defendant.
                            She ended the conversation abruptly by putting down the phone;

                            repeated what she had said earlier. She ended the conversation by
                            putting down the phone before Gerald Foo could finish what he was
                            saying.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In regard to the first incident on
                    22 January 2008, Ms Loh’s counsel, Mr Tan, asserted that
                    the fact that the company had to rely on an incident some 4 months before her
                    employment was terminated showed how frivolous its claim against her was. I
                    agree that the telephone conversation between Mr Foo and Ms Loh on
                    22 January 2008 was a rather poor excuse to terminate the latter’s
                    employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As for the incident on 26 May 2008,
                    Mr Foo wrote to Ms Loh as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I refer to our 2 telephone conversations today, one
                            at 2.10 pm and the subsequent one at 2.25 pm on the issue of trip
                            subsidies for Lusi’s division’s incentive trip to North
                            America.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I am placing on record here that your ranting and
                            raving over the phone and absolute disregard for me as your immediate
                            supervisor is highly unacceptable. This is now the second occasion that
                            you have raised your voice to me. Whatever the issue, this kind of
                            behaviour is tantamount to insubordination and unbecoming.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I am forwarding this matter to Mr Kent Britton,
                            COO Asia, for him to decide on the next course of action.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The incident on 26 May 2008 must be
                    viewed in its proper context. Ms Loh, who denied having put down the phone
                    without hearing Mr Foo’s explanation, had been justifiably annoyed
                    that Mr Foo had undermined her authority by approving subsidies for staff
                    who did not qualify under the company’s incentive program. When
                    cross-examined, Mr Foo conceded that it was necessary for him to have
                    consulted Ms Loh before showing such “favouritism” to some
                    staff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both Mr Britton and Mr Doherty knew
                    that Mr Foo and Ms Loh did not get along and that there had been
                    unpleasant encounters between them. After receiving Mr Foo’s e-mail
                    of 26 May 2008, Ms Loh wrote to Mr Doherty the same day to let
                    him know about her problems in the company. In that letter, she stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In all the 8 years I have worked for you, this is the first time I seek
                        address with you directly. This is because I have no other choice and would
                        like your help to prevail justice over this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, this was what happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We had an incentive program in place last year for consultants and
                        managers. The first batch of qualifiers had already made their trip in April
                        to Phoenix and Texas. We are now preparing for the second batch. I made it
                        clear from the beginning that only full qualifiers in 2006/2007 will get
                        subsidies. All my DMs and my managing director agreed on this. Now, one of
                        the divisions has bypassed me, without my knowledge at all, to get subsidies
                        approval from the managing director for non-qualifiers. To make things
                        worse, the division manager obtained a higher subsidy for herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I found out about this only because my managing director told my secretary
                        that he had settled the incentive. I was upset because:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was not kept in the loop deliberately ....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I expressed [my] displeasure over this to [Mr Gerald Foo], he
                        accused me of being rude and guilty of insubordinate behaviour. Please see
                        the attached e-mail below for your reference....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All this while, the sales team in Singapore has never been given due
                        recognition. For example, during our recent annual dinner and dance, every
                        department head received a plaque in recognition of their contribution. The
                        sales department was left out. My people were disappointed. This may seem
                        like a small oversight. Yet, it is reflective of how we have been treated in
                        recent times….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I sincerely hope you will look into this matter for the sake of the
                        Singapore sales team.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you and best regards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the very next day, 27 May 2008,
                    Mr Doherty replied to Ms Loh as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will check into this matter and help where I am able …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My belief and hope is that you and Gerald will be able to work this matter
                        out as there are too many positive things we should be focussing
                        on....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I will look into helping you to resolve the situation with Gerald Foo
                        so we can move forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the best.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I believe that Mr Doherty really intended
                    to look into issues relating to Ms Loh’s working relationship with
                    Mr Foo and the alleged unfairness referred to by Ms Loh.
                    Mr Britton testified that when he sacked Ms Loh two days after
                    Mr Doherty e-mailed her, no decision had been taken as to who was right in
                    the above-menitoned dispute between Mr Foo and Ms Loh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     During the trial, I noticed that Ms Loh
                    spoke in a louder voice whenever she became agitated. She explained that her
                    manner of bringing up matters to her former bosses had caused no furore in the
                    past and her working style did not change after Mr Foo became her boss. She
                    explained in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) (at
                    para 109):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the years of working for [the company], I had always been direct
                        and forthright in dealing with superiors and subordinates. The previous
                        management valued this management style but somehow, some innocuous
                        telephone calls have been unjustifiably escalated into acts of
                        insubordination and used to justify immediate dismissal. This is blatantly
                        [un]supportable because there has been no prior issue with this approach of
                        giving feedback and resolving issues that has been effective in [the]
                        organization for years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my view, the issue of insubordination is an
                    after-thought, contrived to justify Mr Britton’s extremely
                    high-handed and unwarranted summary dismissal of Ms Loh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Ms Loh discouraged Mr Joosten from accepting a
                promotion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally, the company’s allegation that
                    Ms Loh had discouraged Mr Joosten in January 2008 from accepting any
                    promotion was not proven. Ms Loh, who vehemently denied this allegation,
                    made it clear that there was no reason for her to talk to Mr Joosten about
                    a promotion as this was never on the cards. She did not think highly of him and
                    had ticked him off for incompetence in the following strongly worded e-mail on
                    25 April 2008:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to point out to you that you must be fast on your feet
                        knowing full well that it is urgent that all sales staff are informed of the
                        AIE postponement and I don’t need to “remind you” to
                        take action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, you should have an eye for details ... your mail was sent to a
                        few DMs and Division Secretaries who are not holding their current positions
                        anymore and the needful people like Avril and Annjanette were not copied.
                        More care has to be taken in this respect as certain mails may be
                        confidential and sensitive if it is sent out erroneously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     A few minutes after Ms Loh e-mailed
                    Mr Joosten, Mr Foo e-mailed her to support her position. In another
                    e-mail to Ms Loh a few minutes later, Mr Foo stated that he will have
                    a chat with Mr Joosten and added that he was very “chui
                    thar”, a Hokkien expression that indicated that he was quite fed up with
                    having to talk to Mr Joosten once more about the latter’s work
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     When cross-examined, Mr Foo could not
                    remember when he talked to Mr Joosten about the latter being discouraged by
                    Ms Loh from accepting a promotion. Initially, he said that he spoke to
                    Mr Joosten before Ms Loh was sacked but when pressed further, he said
                    that Mr Joosten could have told him about the matter after she had been
                    sacked by the company. He also could not recall the context in which
                    Mr Joosten had the conversation with him. He gave me the distinct
                    impression that the alleged conversation between Ms Loh and Mr Joosten
                    did not take place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Joosten did not advance the
                    company’s case with his testimony. He admitted that there was
                    “really no love lost” between Ms Loh and him, and confirmed
                    that he had a tense relationship with her. When asked whether Ms Loh had
                    been critical of his work, he took the opportunity to say that she was critical
                    of many things and not just his work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In his AEIC, he stated
                    that Ms Loh had “approached” him to tell him not to accept a
                    promotion but when cross-examined, he testified that she had telephoned him
                    “out of the blue” about the matter. When asked by Mr Tan why
                    he did not mention the phone call in his AEIC and had merely stated that
                    Ms Loh had approached him, he became testy. Although he spoke and
                    understood English well enough, he said that he was a “non-English native
                    speaker” and if Mr Tan’s question was rephrased in Dutch, he
                    would be happy to answer it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Joosten, who conceded that no one had
                    offered to promote him after Sharon was sacked, could not remember much about
                    his conversation with Mr Foo regarding what Ms Loh had allegedly told
                    him or what Mr Foo had said to him. When asked to recall his conversation
                    with Mr Foo, which took place months after Ms Loh had been sacked, he
                    did not answer the question but merely stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I need to emphasize that you’re trying – you are asking me to
                        recall a period that was very painful for me and I’ve gone through
                        many lengths to try to forget stuff and --</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I had no doubt that the company’s
                    assertion that Ms Loh had discouraged Mr Joosten from accepting a
                    promotion in January 2008 was baseless and cannot justify her summary
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on the plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I find that Ms Loh did not breach her
                    employment contract in the manner alleged by the plaintiff. In any case, even if
                    she had been in breach, her boss, Mr Foo testified that the company had
                    suffered no loss as a result. The relevant part of the proceedings is as
                    follows: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the record, Mr Britton’s
                    evidence on the sacking of Ms Loh was also most unsatisfactory. For
                    instance, when he was asked why Ms Loh, whose contribution to the
                    company’s profits was as good, if not better, than Mr Iseli’s
                    contribution to Walton Malaysia’s profits, had not been offered a generous
                    financial package to resign whereas Mr Iseli had been offered such a
                    package, he gave the astonishing reply that she had not been offered a severance
                    package because unlike Mr Iseli, she had not been spreading rumours or
                    perpetuating lies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Apparently, he seemed to believe that those
                    who spread rumours and perpetuated lies should be rewarded with a generous
                    severance package whereas Ms Loh, who did not act in such dastardly ways
                    and had spearheaded the increase in the sale of Walton products in Singapore,
                    should be summarily dismissed without any compensation for the flimsiest of
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For the reasons stated, I dismiss the
                    company’s claim against Ms Loh and find that she had been wrongfully
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As Ms Loh was wrongfully dismissed, she
                    succeeds in her counterclaim for damages. Counsel for both parties agreed that
                    if Ms Loh was wrongfully dismissed, the amount due to her is US$159,717.25.
                    I thus order the company to pay her this amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Ms Loh is entitled to costs.</p>
