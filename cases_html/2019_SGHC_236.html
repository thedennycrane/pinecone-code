The plaintiff was at the material times, and at the time of this judgment, in the midst of a restructuring effort. The plaintiff was covered by a moratorium under s 211B of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), which has been extended by this Court several times since 2018. The moratorium was imposed to allow the plaintiff to eventually propose a scheme of arrangement to its creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the course of 2018, the plaintiff and defendant entered into negotiations, which led to the conclusion of the Restructuring Agreement. Under the Restructuring Agreement, the defendant would invest in the plaintiff by, <span class="font-italic">inter</span><span class="font-italic"> alia¸ </span>subscribing for shares in the plaintiff. Various conditions precedent were specified in the Restructuring Agreement. One of these, cl 5.1(e)(i), stipulated that the consent of the Public Utilities Board (“PUB”) for the change in control of Tuaspring Pte Ltd (“Tuaspring”), a subsidiary of the plaintiff which ran a desalination plant, was to be obtained.

In some instances, the claims are allowed to proceed in so far as court proceedings are permitted to be commenced or continued, with stays being imposed on any execution. The primary consideration is to strike a balance between allowing the restructuring company space and time to pursue its reorganisation without the added distraction of fending off claims by creditors, and on the other hand, avoiding unnecessary delays in the satisfaction of creditor claims.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The plaintiff argues that the moratorium framework under s 211B of the CA is absolute and requires that leave be obtained even for counterclaims. The plaintiff relies on the absence of any express qualifications in favour of such counterclaims in either the statute or rules. Section 211B(12) of the CA specifies that a moratorium does not affect “the exercise of any legal right under any arrangement (including a set-off arrangement or a netting arrangement) that may be prescribed by regulations.”  Regulation 3 of the Companies (Prescribed Arrangements) Regulations 2017 (S 246/2017) only specifies that legal rights under security interest arrangements are not affected.

It would be inimical to allow a claim to proceed but not a counterclaim in respect of the same factual grounds: the defendant would be deprived of either a defence or a reduction of the claim based on the very same facts. Disregarding the counterclaim would tilt the balance too far in favour of the applicant company. This, I believe, is the basis of the various cases cited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Langley Constructions (</span><span class="font-italic">Brixham) Ltd v Wells </span>[1969] 1 WLR 503, the plaintiff company (which was in liquidation) brought proceedings against one of its directors for a sum of £5,000. The defendant attempted to bring a counterclaim against the plaintiff for £15,086 allegedly owing to him.

Leave would be required for the balance of the defendant’s counterclaim (at 513).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">CGU Insurance</span>, the respondent company, which was undergoing liquidation, commenced proceedings against its insurers. The statutory provision in question was s 226(3) of the Companies Act (No 125 of 1965) (M’sia), which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Actions stayed on winding up order</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) when a winding up order has been made … no action or proceedings shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) by leave of the Court; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) in accordance with such terms as the Court imposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The issue before the court was whether the insurers required leave to: (a) appeal a decision in favour of the company; and (b) bring an application for security for costs. The Federal Court of Malaysia held that they were not proceedings “commenced against the company” as they were defensive in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In <span class="font-italic">Thomas Evan Cook</span>, the English Court of Appeal considered the scope of the statutory moratorium under paragraph 43(6) of schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK), which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Moratorium on other legal process</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  This paragraph applies to a company in administration</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) No legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) may be instituted or continued against the company or property of the company except—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) with the consent of the administrator, or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) with the consent of the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Citing <span class="font-italic">Humber &amp; Co v John Griffiths Cycle Co </span>(1901) 85 LT 141, the English Court of Appeal held at [16]–[18] that the statutory moratorium did not apply to defensive steps:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The essential feature of legal proceedings falling within the moratorium is that they must be “against the company”. A claimant who wishes to commence proceedings against a company which has gone into administration … must obtain the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. No such consent or permission is required in the case of proceedings brought by a company which is in administration or which goes into administration after the commencement of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 It follows, as a matter of basic fairness, that defendants to proceedings where the claimant is a company in administration should be able to defend themselves without restriction. This causes no difficulty in taking steps such as serving a defence or witness statements or participating in a trial. However, an issue could be said to arise where defence takes the form of an active step against the claimant company. It is established that essentially defensive steps are not within the statutory moratorium.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 In Humber &amp; Co v John Griffiths Cycle Co (1901) 85 LT 141, the respondent company brought proceedings against the appellants for damages for breach of an alleged contract but the claim was dismissed at first instance. The respondent company appealed to the Court of Appeal after it had been ordered to be wound up. The appeal was allowed and the defendants appealed to the House of Lords. A preliminary objection was taken on behalf of the respondent company that an appeal was a proceeding against the company within section 87 of the Companies Act 1862, which provided that when a winding-up order had been made “no suit, action, or other proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with the leave of the court”. The House of Lords rejected the submission, Lord Davey saying:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘I am of opinion that the objection cannot be maintained. It was the respondents who themselves proceeded with the action after the winding-up order, by prosecuting their appeal in the Court of Appeal, and when once an action by the company itself has been proceeded with, there is no necessity for the defendants in the action to obtain leave for any defensive proceedings on their part …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 What can be gleaned from these cases is that where a statutory moratorium is imposed in respect of the commencement of proceedings against a company, it would ordinarily not cover situations where the company itself commences proceedings and the defendant seeks, through a counterclaim, to reduce or extinguish any liability owed to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 While there does not appear to be any mention of an exception for counterclaims in any of the Parliamentary debates relating to the enactment of s 211B of the CA, I do not find that the intention was manifested to require leave to be obtained for counterclaims. Clearer language would have been expected to be used had that been the intention. The position at common law in relation to the interpretation of similar statutes would have been well understood: see [18]–[20] above. In the absence of express language to the contrary, the expectation is that Parliament intended to leave existing case law unaffected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It follows that a counterclaim made in respect of a claim brought by a company undergoing s 211B restructuring would not require leave of court, but only in so far as it operates to extinguish or negate the claim, without affecting the position of the other creditors. Thus, any part of a counterclaim that goes beyond operating as a defence, such as a claim for damages or property, would require the leave of court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Leave to proceed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In any event, oral application for leave was made at the hearing. The plaintiff, correctly it must be said, does not take issue with the granting of leave, subject to conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I am of the view that leave should be granted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The principles governing the granting of leave are clear. <span class="font-italic">In r</span><span class="font-italic">e Atlantic Computer Systems Plc</span> [1992] 2 WLR 367<span class="font-italic"> </span>has been the primary case cited in applications thus far. That case concerned the granting of leave in relation to the enforcement of security, but its considerations are applicable generally. In particular, it was noted that the granting of leave requires a balancing exercise between the secured creditor in that case, and those of the other creditors (at 395A–C). Here, the balancing exercise would need to consider the interests of the defendant as against those of the plaintiff’s other creditors.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the present case, a number of factors would have to be weighed, including:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the impact on the other creditors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the possible distraction from restructuring; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the prejudice or effect of either refusing or allowing the application on the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Bearing these in mind, I find it appropriate to grant leave in the present case. Safeguards may be put in place to minimise the impact on the other creditors. Leave can be restricted to allowing the counterclaim and associated claims to be pursued only to determination of liability (if any), with enforcement or execution of any award or order being stayed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As for the possible distraction of the company from focussing its resources on the restructuring, that would be a valid objection but for the fact that here part of the defendant’s counterclaim can proceed even without leave of court (see [23] above). Any additional burden, it seems, is unlikely to be that substantial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, allowing the counterclaim to proceed would not appear to have any significant adverse impact on the plaintiff, while disallowing it would expose the defendant to a claim that it could otherwise possibly extinguish or attenuate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For the reasons above, leave is restricted to the same extent as the portion of the counterclaim which does not require leave. Other matters such as the defendant’s claim for damages may proceed to trial, but not execution. This will ensure that the defendant does not gain an advantage over the plaintiff’s other creditors through its counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summons No 3287 of 2019:  Determination under O 14 r 12</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The other summons before me was one for determination of a question of law or construction under O 14 r 12 of the ROC, relating to the fulfilment of a condition precedent specified in the restructuring agreement between the parties. The controversy between the parties is whether a letter issued by the PUB satisfied clause 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement. The defendant says that it did not. The plaintiff’s position is that it did, but that in any event the case should proceed to trial as it would not be determinative of the matter.

</div> Even if the PUB letter did not satisfy cl 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement, the defendant would not have been entitled to terminate the agreement prior to the long-stop date of 16 April 2019. The five instances of alleged repudiatory conduct on the part of the defendant, having occurred prior to 16 April 2019, meant that the defendant repudiated the Restructuring Agreement prior to 16 April 2019. The plaintiff was thus entitled to the escrow sum.

The precise legal status (in particular, the limits (if any) and/or safeguards) of a situation involving evidence of prior negotiations remains to be worked out in a future case (when full argument has been heard), although there ought, in our view, to be no difficulty in satisfying the three requirements set out in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Zurich Insurance</span> where the situation concerned (such as that in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Inglis</span>) is extremely clear <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and</span>, in any event, in a case such as the present, the evidence of prior negotiations merely serves as a <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">confirmatory</span> (and, hence, complementary as well as subsidiary) function.

Clause 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement was aimed at avoiding a default under the WPA and a loss of the desalination plant and other infrastructure; the consent provided by PUB, being conditional on the termination of the WPA and the purchase by PUB of the desalination plant and other infrastructure, could not therefore satisfy clause 5.1(e)(i) without leading to an absurd result.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Determination of the Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Here, I am satisfied that the evidence of pre-contractual negotiations could be material, and might play a role in the determination of the interpretation and construction of cl 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement. The evidence would also seem to be available to all parties, and would possibly point to a clear and obvious context: the <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> criteria could be fulfilled here. At any rate, it is important to note that the evidence of pre-contractual negotiations may not ultimately be determinative or conclusive. What matters at this point, when the court is considering the invocation of O 14 r 12 of the ROC, is whether there are factual disputes that could determine the outcome of the suits. The pre-contractual negotiations may shed light on the proper interpretation of cl 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement, and therefore, should be left for trial rather than be determined one way or another right now.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The appropriate standard at this stage is guided by the requirement under O 14 r 12 (1) (a) of the ROC, that ‘such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the action’. The door has been left open for evidence of pre-contractual negotiations to influence the interpretation and construction of cl 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement. That is enough to show that disposal of the question under O 14 r 12 of the ROC is not suitable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 While there may be some tentativeness about the consideration of pre-contractual negotiations, the entire agreement clause does not itself bar such evidence: cl 17.2 of the Restructuring Agreement prescribes the terms of the contract, but does not control how those terms are to be interpreted, which is the exercise for which the pre-contractual negotiations might be relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As for the question of absurdity, what amounts to absurdity would have to be taken against the objective intention of the parties together: there would be no absurdity if it was indeed agreed that the risk of the loss of the desalination plant and infrastructure was to be left with the defendant alone. It is thus necessary to examine what the actual agreement was, which in these circumstances calls for a trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Specificity of pleadings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendants correctly submitted that the pleadings should be specific. In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>, the Court of Appeal noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73     We hasten to add that although the contextual approach is most frequently engaged in the context of <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">interpretation</span>, this is not to say that the contextual approach is irrelevant when it comes to other aspects of construction such as implication or rectification. Indeed, it is trite that the court must have regard to the context at the time of contracting when considering the issue of implication. Therefore, to buttress the evidentiary qualifications to the contextual approach to the construction of a contract, the imposition of four requirements of civil procedure are, in our view, timely and essential:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)     first, parties who contend that the factual matrix is relevant to the construction of the contract must plead with specificity each fact of the factual matrix that they wish to rely on in support of their construction of the contract;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     second, the factual circumstances in which the facts in (a) were known to both or all the relevant parties must also be pleaded with sufficient particularity;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)     third, parties should in their pleadings specify the effect which such facts will have on their contended construction; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)     fourth, the obligation of parties to disclose evidence would be limited by the extent to which the evidence are relevant to the facts pleaded in (a) and (b).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Here, what was in the pleadings seemed to fall shy of the above requirements. The plaintiff only pleaded repudiatory conduct by the defendants, and did not go into the negotiations between the parties, as well as the interpretation or construction that should be made of cl 5.1(e)(i).  It could perhaps be read in that the plaintiff had a different interpretation of the requirements, but that is not enough to fulfil the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>requirements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Be that as it may, I do note that the requirement of specificity regarding pleadings laid down in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>relates to matters after trial, and not at the interlocutory stage. As matters have not progressed that far, an opportunity for the plaintiff to amend its pleadings will be given. This will enable the real issue in controversy between the parties to be determined: see <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital </span>at [44]–[46]. The plaintiff should specify the particulars of the pre-contractual negotiations which it intends to rely on, failing which the defendant will be at liberty to apply for determination of this question on the basis that no further evidence will be adduced. Any cost consequences from the amendment of the pleadings can be addressed separately. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The plain and ordinary meaning</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 All that could be determined at this stage, without trial, was the plain and ordinary meaning of cl 5.1(e)(i) of the Restructuring Agreement. Other materials would be required to determine its actual meaning in the Restructuring Agreement. There is little saving of time and costs in just considering what the plain and ordinary meaning might be, since the contract could possibly not turn on that at all, if it is shown that the meaning between the parties was something else. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Directions for costs arguments will be given separately, with time for appeal extended in the meantime till after the costs determination has been made.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the above reasons, the counterclaim may be raised. Such a counterclaim does not need leave of the Court, in so far as it does not operate as more than a defence. Since the defendants have sought leave, and wish to pursue remedies going beyond a pure defence, leave is granted for them to assert and pursue the counterclaim, save that no execution of any judgment, including the release of funds or payment, is to occur without leave so long as the moratorium is in place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As for the determination under O 14 r 12 of the ROC, I find that that it would not be appropriate to answer the question posed at this time, as there are factual issues to be determined which require a full trial. However, the plaintiff has not yet sufficiently pleaded its case specifically on the factual assertions and must amend its pleadings accordingly (see [56]–[58] above).  Directions will be given for amendments to be made to sufficiently address the concerns raised in this judgment, failing which the defendants may revive its application under O 14 r 12 of the ROC. No order is made on the O 14 r 12 application at this time. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Leo Zhen Wei Lionel, Liu Zhao Xiang, Tan Kai Yun and Muhammad Ismail K.O.
