In the circumstances, I was unable to adopt Mr Lim’s submissions as to loss of future earnings.

Dr Chong said that it was unlikely that he would stop breathing because the automatic breathing mechanism is so strong that it is almost impossible to inhibit.

He took public transport on his own.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 He travelled to Japan in December 2018 in the company of a cousin who apparently had never seem the Plaintiff having a fit and would not know how to react if he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It appears he is able to carry out the activities of daily living.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In my view, it has not been proved on balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff would need a domestic helper on account of his condition brought about by the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 He is able to carry on the activities of daily living, to take public transportation to go skateboarding with friends (but not to perform stunts) and even to take videos while doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I note that the frequency of epileptic fits has tapered off to just one episode in 2018. While Dr Pillay opined that it could recur in the future, Dr Chong was more optimistic that in future he might even be taken off the medication for his condition. In any event, in Dr Chong’s view, even if he were to suffer another seizure, there is little risk that he would come to harm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In these circumstances, I would disallow the Plaintiff’s claim for future expenses of employing a domestic helper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Provision for additional insurance premium which plaintiff is likely to pay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 There is evidence that there is an additional premium of $36.12 per month payable in respect of life insurance for the Plaintiff on account of his condition. The Defendant does not object to the quantum of the additional premium but submits that a multiplier of only 10 years should apply. I do not see why the same multiplier of 25 years should not apply here as was used in regard to other heads of claim earlier considered.

It is settled law that where a claimant had taken out accident insurance, the moneys received by him under the insurance policy are not to be taken into account when assessing the damages for the injury in respect of which he had been paid the insurance moneys. (See the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">The “MARA” </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 31 at [28] and this court’s application of same in <span class="font-italic">N</span><span class="font-italic">g Lay Peng v Gain City Engineering &amp; Consultancy Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGHC 184 at [164] to [167]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The mere happenstance that NTUC Income is also the insurer under the Defendant’s motor vehicle insurance policy does not make for any principled or cogent departure from settled law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Plaintiff’s figure of $81,461.91, being a counting error.

We continued to pray for his survival.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. The Plaintiff had another surgery on 19th April 2013. He was in ICU for about 10 days. He was unconscious most of the time until he was transferred to the general ward. Danial was unable to talk, his limbs were extremely weak. He did not seem to recognize us initially. While at KTPH for about 2 months, he was on drips daily. No food was allowed by mouth. He body weight dropped drastically. We took turns to be with him at the hospital. We motivated and encouraged him daily. We showed him pictures, video clips of him and his friends, etc. When he was able to move his limbs slowly and was still unable to talk, we write to him to communicate with him as we were not sure if he understood what we were saying. We used a portable whiteboard with markers and eraser. To our horror, when he scribbled some letters, we could not figure out what they were. To aid him further, we brought him magnetic alphabets and numbers. He had to re-learn alphabets and numbers and gradually was able to form words and can do simple calculations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. Through therapy, we were able to move the Plaintiff’s limbs more &amp; gradually aided him to take baby steps before he was relocated to the TTSH Rehab Centre in Ang Mo Kio for rehabilitative care.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Plaintiff was in the Rehabilitation Centre until 6 June 2013.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… On 8th November 2013, he had his first epilepsy attack in the morning. He fell at the staircase at home. We did not know it was epilepsy then. My husband and I had just completed our morning prayers when we heard a loud thud. We quickly rushed up and saw him at the mid-level staircase. We were shocked and quickly called for the ambulance as I recalled the surgeon informing us that a fall could be fatal for him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The Plaintiff had 46 epileptic fits between 8 November 2013 and 3 June 2018 with greater frequency (35 episodes) in 2013 through 2015. In 2016 he had six seizures, four in 2017 and one in 2018. Although the frequency was seen to be tapering off, Dr Pillay opined that could still occur.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The mother explained that the doctors had advised that the Plaintiff should not injure his head again as that might lead to serious consequences. For that reason she took leave to care for the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 What is a reasonable period for the mother to have taken leave to care for the Plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Firstly, for the period of about three months after the accident, his needs were such that it would be clearly unreasonable to expect the mother to have delegated the personal care of the Plaintiff to a third party caregiver. Nor do I consider it unreasonable that after his discharge from KTPH on 13 June 2013 the mother continued to care for him at home for a further period up to 31 December 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Especially with the advent of the epileptic seizures on 8 November 2013, it is understandable why the mother stayed home to look after him. In this connection, Dr. Chong was of the view that, post-accident, two years would be a reasonable period for the mother to have stayed at home or to have an experienced caregiver to look after him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I would allow full recovery of the mother’s loss of salary (inclusive of employers’ CPF contributions) of $11,588.37 per month from 18 April 2013 to 31 December 2013. This works out to be $97,728.59. In this connection I should state that although there is a certificate from the mother’s employer, the Singapore Prisons Service referring to a period of no pay leave from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2017, counsel for the Plaintiff submitted without demur from the Defendant, that she had commenced no pay leave from the date of the accident (see para 56 of the Plaintiff’s written submissions).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For the remainder of the two year period recommended by Dr. Chong, I will adopt the figure of $1,000 a month proposed by the Defendant. This figure is also one of the alternatives submitted by the Plaintiff in para 56 of Plaintiff’s written submissions. This will result in a total of $113,728.59 ($97,728.59 + $ 16,000 ($1000 per month from January 2014 to April 2015)).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Costs of Renovation and Refund of Examination fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Special damages in respect of the costs incurred in renovating the Plaintiff’s home to cater to his needs have been agreed at $4,600.
