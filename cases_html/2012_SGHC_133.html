<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an action brought by the plaintiff, PH
                    Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd, against its former employee, Mr Rinov
                    Herawan, the second defendant in this suit, and his current employer, Intrepid
                    Offshore Construction Pte Ltd, the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As an overview of the claims against both
                    defendants, the plaintiff alleged copyright infringement and breach of
                    confidence in respect of five of its General Arrangement drawings (“GA
                    drawings”) of winches (the “five GA drawings”). Further,
                    only as against the second defendant, the plaintiff alleged breach of the
                    non-competition clause in his employment agreement with the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a Singapore-incorporated
                    company which designs and provides hydraulic and electrical installations, like
                    winch systems, for the marine industry. It also manufactures drilling rig
                    equipment for the marine industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant is a Singapore-incorporated
                    company which provides and manufactures hydraulic and electrical installations
                    such as winch systems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant was a former employee of
                    the plaintiff. He worked there from 16 May 2006 to 31 July 2008 as a
                    Mechanical Design Engineer. After that, he resigned and joined EMS Engineering
                    &amp; Marine Services (Pte) Ltd (“EMS”) on 1 August 2008,
                    leaving it thereafter to work for the first defendant as a Project Engineer on
                    1 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The second defendant signed an employment
                    agreement dated 16 May 2006 when he commenced work with the plaintiff. In
                    that agreement, the clauses relevant to the present suit are the confidentiality
                    clause and the non-competition clause. They are set out below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During his term of employment with the
                    plaintiff, the second defendant worked in the engineering department and was
                    involved in the authorship of the five GA drawings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> According to the plaintiff, these winches
                    were designed and customised specially for its customers. As these five GA
                    drawings formed the subject matter of the plaintiff’s copyright
                    infringement and breach of confidentiality claims, it would be useful to set out
                    the names of these drawings here:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     150 Ton Winch General
                        Arrangement,</p>

                        Winch GA-LH Side Drive, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     450T Linear Winch.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       During his employment with the plaintiff, the
                    second defendant had access to the plaintiff’s engineering and design
                    drawings relating to hydraulics-related machines and equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The second defendant resigned as an employee of
                    the plaintiff on 31 July 2008 and joined EMS as a Mechanical Design
                    Engineer on 1 August 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently, the second defendant left EMS
                    and started work as a Project Engineer at the first defendant on 1 December
                    2009. It was not disputed that the first defendant was a competitor of the
                    plaintiff in the marine industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In 2010, the plaintiff learnt that the first
                    defendant had published a hard copy promotional catalogue exhibiting its product
                    expertise. It was titled “Product Showcase Catalogue 2010”
                    (“catalogue”). This catalogue was also published on the first
                    defendant’s website. In the catalogue, five general arrangement drawings
                    of winches (the “infringing drawings”) were similar to the
                    plaintiff’s five GA drawings listed at para <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above. They were described in the first defendant’s
                    catalogue correspondingly as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Electric Drive Winch 150 T
                        SWL,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Constant
                        Tension Winch 30 T SWL,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Waterfall Type Winch 100 T SWL,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     A &amp; R Winch 150 mT,
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     Linear Winch
                        500 T. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A private investigator hired by the plaintiff
                    was shown the catalogue bearing the infringing GA drawings. The private
                    investigator also obtained seven drawings from the first defendant during a
                    meeting with it at its premises, of which three were allegedly similar to the
                    plaintiff’s drawings of winches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     To reiterate, the plaintiff claimed copyright
                    infringement and a breach of confidence against both defendants in respect of
                    the five GA drawings. Against the second defendant, the plaintiff additionally
                    claimed a breach of the non-competition clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     First, it was pleaded by the plaintiff that
                    its copyright in the five GA drawings was infringed. The plaintiff argued that
                    the GA drawings were copyrighted artistic works under section 7(1) of the
                    Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”). Pursuant to section
                    30(6) CA, since the authors of the five GA drawings were the plaintiff’s
                    employees who authored them during their employment, the plaintiff was the owner
                    of the copyright to these. It submitted that because the defendants had
                    substantially reproduced and published the GA drawings in its catalogue and its
                    website, this constituted copyright infringement under section 31(1) and section
                    10(1) CA. To establish its infringement claim, it relied both on the fact that
                    the second defendant had ample opportunities to access the plaintiff’s
                    five GA drawings and the fact that there was such close similarity between these
                    drawings and the drawings in the first defendant’s catalogue and website.
                    Observable “fingerprints” were pointed out. The plaintiff further
                    argued that it was very probable that the second defendant himself provided the
                    plaintiff’s GA drawings to the first defendant which then published a
                    substantial reproduction of these drawings on its own catalogue and
                    website.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Second, the plaintiff pleaded breach of
                    confidence by the defendants. It emphasized the confidential nature of the
                    plaintiff’s GA drawings as the winch designs were customised for their
                    clients’ needs. The plaintiff added that not only were the five GA
                    drawings marked confidential, it had also put in place security measures and
                    policies to safeguard their confidentiality. The plaintiff alleged that the
                    second defendant breached the confidentiality clause in his Employment agreement
                    (see para <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) when he revealed the
                    plaintiff’s five GA drawings to the first defendant. The plaintiff argued
                    that, contrary to the first defendant’s assertions, it did not hand over
                    the GA drawings to the first defendant without qualifications of confidentiality
                    made, pursuant to work done and a meeting held regarding the Bumi Armada project
                    which both the plaintiff and the first defendant were involved in. The Bumi
                    Armada project involved the plaintiff providing specific winches to a vessel.
                    The plaintiff also asserted that, in any case, the first defendant, as an
                    indirect unauthorised recipient of confidential information, would have an
                    equitable obligation to protect the drawings’ confidentiality and could
                    not use them in its catalogue and website. Further, the plaintiff sought to rely
                    on the springboard doctrine, arguing that since the first defendant was a
                    newcomer to the winch business, not stopping its acts would confer an unfair
                    head start on the first defendant and cause detriment to the plaintiff. The
                    detriment alleged was a loss in reputation should customers believe wrongly that
                    the first defendant created the designs which the plaintiff simply
                    copied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Third, the plaintiff alleged that the second
                    defendant breached the non-competition clause in his Employment agreement by
                    working for the first defendant who was a direct competitor of the plaintiff.
                    The non-competition clause, it was argued, was valid, being limited to Singapore
                    and Malaysia and lasting only two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff claimed the following relief:
                    injunctions to restrain the copyright infringement and the breach of
                    confidentiality, an inquiry into damages for the copyright infringement and the
                    breach of confidentiality or, alternatively, for an account of profits and an
                    order for delivery up or destruction of the infringing drawings and confidential
                    information. Additionally, specific only to the second defendant, the plaintiff
                    asked for damages for the breach of the terms of his Employment
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the copyright infringement claim, while the
                    defendants did not appear to deny that they had substantially reproduced the
                    five GA drawings on its catalogue and its website, they disputed copyright
                    ownership of these drawings as they disagreed that the GA drawings were the
                    original work of the plaintiff’s employees at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     They also pleaded the defence of industrial
                    application, <em>i.e</em>., that even if the defendants had
                    manufactured articles from the drawings, copyright would not be infringed as
                    these drawings have been industrially applied for sale or hire. However, the
                    defendants did not pursue this defence in their closing
                submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendants addressed the issue of damages
                    for copyright infringement in more detail in their submissions. They argued that
                    an award of nominal damages would suffice as the plaintiff’s loss could
                    not be proved. This was because the plaintiff’s business was in designing,
                    manufacturing and selling of winches and not in drawings, that the plaintiff did
                    not receive further winch orders based on the five GA drawings and that there
                    was no evidence that the defendants had designed or sold any winches based on
                    the plaintiff’s GA drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In particular, the defendants addressed the
                    issue of statutory damages under s 119(5) CA in their submissions. They argued
                    that damages, if any, should be nominal. On the factors set out in s 119(5),
                    they submitted that there was no flagrant infringement because no wilful copying
                    was done, the plaintiff suffered no loss in sales as winches were customised
                    products not simply bought off the catalogue, the defendants’ benefit was
                    negligible as the time saved in drawing a GA drawing was not considerable, that
                    they acted reasonably in the conduct of proceedings and that there was a need to
                    stop frivolous litigation like the present case commenced by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendants denied breaching their
                    confidentiality obligation. They argued that the circumstances in which the five
                    GA drawings were disclosed to the first defendant were not confidential as the
                    plaintiff’s representatives had given these drawings to the first
                    defendant directly during a meeting held in April 2008 concerning the Bumi
                    Armada project with no express qualifications of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendants also pointed out that the five
                    GA drawings could not constitute confidential information or trade secrets
                    because they were simply preliminary drawings and that there was no policy of
                    confidentiality practised by the plaintiff. Hard and soft copies of technical
                    drawings created by the plaintiff’s employees were freely circulated
                    within the plaintiff’s premises and not kept under physical or virtual
                    lock and key.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second defendant, while acknowledging the
                    presence of a confidentiality clause in his Employment agreement, disputed
                    access to or knowledge of any such confidential information during his
                    employment with the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In their submissions, the defendants also
                    argued that under the confidentiality clause of the second defendant’s
                    Employment agreement, the plaintiff’s GA drawings would have already
                    ceased to be confidential by 1 August 2010. This was before the first
                    defendant created its catalogue in October 2010. Therefore they should not be
                    under any further confidentiality obligation concerning the five GA
                    drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the springboard principle, the first
                    defendant submitted that it did not apply when the allegedly confidential
                    information had entered the public domain as was the case here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the breach of the non-competition clause,
                    the second defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had acquiesced in his alleged
                    breach of the clause by not taking any action against him previously. This was
                    despite finding out through his exit interview that he was joining the
                    plaintiff’s competitor, EMS. It was also pleaded that the non-competition
                    clause was void and contrary to public policy, being a restraint of trade. The
                    reasons given were that the two-year restriction was too long, he was a
                    relatively junior employee and the plaintiff had no legitimate interest to
                    protect since the GA drawings were not confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I will first deal with the issue of liability
                    for the respective claims made before addressing the corresponding
                    relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was infringement of copyright in the plaintiff’s
                five GA drawings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I found that the defendants had infringed the
                    copyright in the five GA drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This claim was easily disposed of as the
                    defendants made various admissions on infringement in the course of their
                    cross-examination. Before I address the defendants’ admissions, I will
                    discuss how the claim could be made out on the evidence available in any
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s five GA drawings were
                    original artistic works protectable by copyright under section 7(1)(a) CA.
                    Simplicity of works does not detract from copyright protection: <em>Auvi Pte Ltd v Seah Siew Tee and another</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R)
                    786; [1991] SGHC 165 at [33]. The plaintiff’s five GA drawings would enjoy
                    copyright protection despite being simple preliminary drawings of winches. While
                    the defendants repeatedly contended that the copyright in the five GA drawings
                    did not subsist in the plaintiff, it was difficult to maintain this argument
                    because the drawings were in fact drawn by the plaintiff’s employees
                    during the course of their employment with the plaintiff in Singapore. The
                    second defendant was one such employee. The list of employees involved in
                    authoring the GA drawings was set out by the plaintiff’s third witness and
                    director, Mr Loh Lan Chiung (“Loh”), at paras [9]-[10] of his
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). The second defendant in
                    his AEIC at para [25] also alluded to this, saying that he was either author or
                    co-author of the drawings while he was in the employment of the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The legislative provision relevant to the
                    defendants’ infringing act here is section 31 CA. Ng-Loy Wee Loon in
                        <em>Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore (Sweet &amp;
                        Maxwell, 2009 Rev Ed)</em> (“Ng-Loy”) at [10.1.1]
                    summarised the essence of primary infringement as doing in Singapore any act
                    comprised in the copyright without the licence of the copyright owner. The act
                    in issue here was reproducing in material form the five GA drawings in the first
                    defendant’s catalogue and website. The author noted that infringement is
                    likely where there is ‘causal connection’ in the form of the
                    defendant copying from the plaintiff’s copyrighted work and where
                    infringement concerns taking a ‘substantial part’ of the copyrighted
                    work: <em>Ng-Loy</em> at [10.1.3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Court of Appeal held in <em>Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd v Lam Heng Chung</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 610;
                    [2001] SGCA 75 (“<em>Flamelite</em>”) at
                    [27]-[28] that a <em>prima facie</em> inference of
                    ‘causal connection’ may be drawn where the defendant had access to
                    the plaintiff’s work and where there was close similarity between the
                    defendant’s and the plaintiff’s work. The defendant can then rebut
                    the inference of copying by offering an alternative explanation for the
                    works’ similarity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As an engineer working in the
                    plaintiff’s engineering department where the GA drawings were kept, the
                    second defendant had ready access to the hard and soft copies of the
                    plaintiff’s GA drawings during his employment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I agreed with the plaintiff’s
                    submission that the defendants’ infringing drawings bore substantial
                    similarity to the plaintiff’s GA drawings. A visual comparison of the
                    first defendant’s drawings and the plaintiff’s drawings would find
                    striking similarities between them. Besides, during cross-examination, Loh went
                    so far as to say that after adjusting for dimension, upon comparing both
                    parties’ drawings using a light-box, he found that there were substantial
                    similarities between them, with corresponding drawing lines.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the plaintiff pointed out
                    various tell-tale “fingerprints” on its five GA drawings which
                    were also present on the infringing drawings. These comprise mainly of erroneous
                    features and lines such as leader lines and dimensional lines which were not
                    drawn to indicate functional components of a winch. The significance of
                    “fingerprints” pointing to substantial similarity of works was
                    noted by the High Court in <em>Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        Singapore Land Authority</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 86; [2008] SGHC
                    42.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The “fingerprints” on each of
                    the plaintiff’s five GA drawings which were found on the first
                    defendant’s corresponding infringing drawings were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     150 Ton Winch General Arrangement:
                        Leader lines in the plaintiff’s drawing were present in the first
                        defendant’s drawing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mooring Winch c/w Spooling General Arrangement: The
                        feature of four outer lifting eyes in the winch which was left erroneously
                        in the plaintiff’s drawing was present in the first defendant’s
                        drawing. Pull direction lines, indicative only of direction of motion and
                        not part of the actual make-up of winch, were present in both drawings at
                        the same positions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Waterfall Winch General Layout: Two extension lines and one
                        dimensional line were found in the same positions in both
                    drawings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     175T
                        Mooring Winch GA-LH Side Drive: Leader lines in the plaintiff’s
                        drawing were also similarly seen in the first defendant’s drawing. The
                        hole positions of the winches in both drawings were found at the same
                        positions; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     450T Linear Winch: Erroneous annotations on the plaintiff’s drawing
                        were replicated in the first defendant’s drawing. Leader lines, detail
                        circles and dimension lines found in the plaintiff’s drawing were
                        similarly present in the first defendant’s drawing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     With the close visual similarities and the
                    “fingerprints” in both sets of drawings shown, substantial
                    similarity between the plaintiff’s five GA drawings and the first
                    defendant’s infringing drawings was found. Coupled with the second
                    defendant’s access to the plaintiff’s drawings, this gave rise to
                    the inference that the defendants copied the plaintiff’s five GA drawings.
                    No credible alternative explanation was proffered by the defendants on the facts
                    to rebut this inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Additionally, it was not difficult to find
                    that a substantial proportion of the plaintiff’s five GA drawings had been
                    copied by the defendants. Reference must be made to quality and not quantity
                    when deciding whether a substantial part of the copyright holder’s work
                    had been reproduced: <em>Flamelite</em> at [37]. The
                    substance of the plaintiff’s five GA drawings here were the technical
                    pictorial sketches of the winches itself. That these sketches were reproduced in
                    the defendants’ catalogues and website albeit with minor variations showed
                    that substantial portions of the plaintiff’s five GA drawings were
                    copied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Therefore, with the requisite causal
                    connection established (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) and
                    a substantial part of plaintiff’s GA drawings held to have been copied
                    (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above), the plaintiff’s
                    claim that its copyright in the five GA drawings had been infringed is made out
                    against the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any case, I agreed with the
                    plaintiff’s submissions that during trial, admissions were elicited from
                    the defendants that they had committed the infringing acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The starkest admission of copyright
                    infringement by the first defendant came from Mr James Dobbs
                    (“Dobbs”), the defendants’ second witness and director of
                    the first defendant, in the course of cross-examination. The relevant section of
                    the cross-examination is as follows: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So these drawings, you in fact copied it from
                            others.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">(indistinct)---</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Are you saying that?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, that’s what happened, yah.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So this seven drawings at 2---page 223 to 231 were
                            copied from others including my clients. Is that your

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, that’s correct, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This position echoed Dobbs’ AEIC at para
                    [31] where he admitted that on hindsight, “it may have been (the first
                    defendant’s) mistake to copy (the plaintiff’s) drawings so
                    closely.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second defendant admitted, albeit more
                    obliquely, to an infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright. When
                    cross-examined, he answered as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now it is your case, as I understand, that the
                            plaintiff’s drawings were in fact used in the catalogue. Your case
                            is that there’s no confidentiality, that’s it. But you are
                            not disputing that the drawings were used in the
                        catalogue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mm, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As such, on the weight of the evidence and in
                    light of the admissions, a clear case of copyright infringement was made out by
                    the plaintiff against the defendants for each of its five GA
                drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a breach of confidentiality of the
                plaintiff’s five GA drawings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the second defendant’s employment
                    agreement, the plaintiff had provided expressly for a definition of what it
                    regarded as amounting to “confidential information”. The plaintiff
                    submitted that the five GA drawings were confidential information as these were
                    contemplated by the phrase “the design … of the hydraulics related
                    machines” in the definition part of the confidentiality clause (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). I agreed with the
                    plaintiff’s submissions on this and found that the GA drawings did amount
                    to confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Each of the five GA drawings also had a
                    confidentiality statement marked at the top as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“This document and all information and data disclosed herein or
                        herewith are the confidential and proprietary property of PH Hydraulics
                        &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd and are not to be used, reproduced or disclosed in
                        whole or in part by or to anyone without written permission of PH Hydraulics
                        &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While not conclusive, I found that this did help in indicating the
                    confidentiality of the drawings: <em>Ng-Loy</em> at
                    [39.1.8]. The simplicity of the GA drawings would not in themselves make them
                    incapable of being protected as confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The essence of information being confidential
                    is that it is not freely available in the public domain: <em>Ng-Loy</em> at [39.1.1]. It bears emphasis, as the authors in Bently
                    and Sherman, <em>Intellectual Property Law</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) (“<em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em>”) noted at p 1014, that an
                    action for breach of confidence is built around the notion of “relative
                    secrecy”. That is, information may still be regarded as not being in the
                    public domain even though a number of people know about it. Whether the
                    information was published in a sufficiently widespread manner for it to lose its
                    confidentiality depended on various factors such as the type of information, the
                    section of public who have an interest in knowing about the information, the
                    domain in which the publication occurred, the degree of publication in that
                    domain, the form in which the information is published and the vigour with which
                    the information is likely to be pursued within that domain: <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> at 1014-1015. In this regard , the
                    plaintiff pointed out, correctly in my view, that although it had published the
                    GA drawings in its operating manuals and sent out soft copies of its drawings,
                    these were issued only for the limited and specific purpose of its
                    customers’ use and consideration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> There did not appear to be strong evidence
                    that the plaintiff’s customers’ widely disseminated these drawings
                    thereafter. Thus the five GA drawings here would not lose their confidentiality
                    merely because of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     To address parties’ arguments whether
                    the five GA drawings were simply confidential information or if they amounted to
                    trade secrets <em>i.e.</em>, highly confidential
                    information, I found guidance in <em>Man Financial v Wong Bark
                        Chuan</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663; [2007] SGCA 53 (“<em>Man Financial</em>”) (at [83]) where the Court of
                    Appeal adopted the factors set out by Neill LJ in <em>Faccenda
                        Chicken Ltd v Fowler</em> [1987] Ch 117 (“<em>Faccenda Chicken</em>”) at 137-138:</p>

                            circumstances, “of such a highly confidential nature as to

                            prevent the use or disclosure of the information in question, it was
                            insufficient for the employer to merely tell the employee that the
                            information was confidential. The employer’s attitude towards the

                            package is not confidential, this factor, although not conclusive in
                            itself, can shed light on whether the information in question is truly a
                            trade secret.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The second defendant worked in the
                    plaintiff’s engineering department as a mechanical design engineer and was
                    involved in producing GA drawings which were regarded as confidential by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The GA drawings were customised and designed
                    specially according to its customers’ specifications<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and
                    that these were unique works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff stated that its customers
                    expected it to keep their projects confidential and the GA drawings were part of
                    the projects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I also took cognisance of the steps that the
                    plaintiff had taken to keep their GA drawings confidential. The plaintiff stated
                    that soft copy drawings were kept in a password-protected file server accessible
                    only by engineering department employees while the hard copies were kept in
                    cabinets within the plaintiff’s engineering department with restricted
                    access to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> It added that whenever drawings were
                    issued out to the engineering employees, they had to sign against
                        them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> However, the defendants countered
                    that Willie Ng, the plaintiff’s first witness and sales manager, stated
                    during cross-examination that the sales team generally had easy access to the
                    plaintiff’s GA drawings. Further he said that he had sent out amended
                    copies of these drawings to prospective customers’ merely with verbal
                    permission despite the plaintiff’s printed confidentiality statement
                    stipulating written permission (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>
                        above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Further, it was revealed
                    during Loh’s cross-examination that while there was a numbering system for
                    each of the original GA drawings, there was no system to record the number of
                    copies made of each of these drawings when they were issued to the
                    plaintiff’s employees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> These revelations
                    allowed for inferences to be made that in practice, the plaintiffs did not treat
                    its GA drawings as highly confidential material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Therefore, I concluded that the
                    plaintiff’s five GA drawings were confidential information but were not of
                    such a high degree of confidentiality as to amount to trade
                secrets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I turn now to examine if a breach of the
                    defendants’ obligation of confidentiality was established on the
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendants argued that the five GA
                    drawings in issue were given to the first defendant without any qualifications
                    of confidentiality made by the plaintiff during a meeting in April 2008 with the
                    plaintiff’s representatives, Mr Steven Seow and Mr Adrian Tan. They also
                    claimed that one of the GA drawings had been copied to the first defendant in an
                    email sent on January 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> However, as
                    the plaintiff pointed out, the defendants had not adduced any evidence in
                    support of these claims. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The defendants did not exhibit any documentary
                    evidence of the minutes of the meeting or their notes thereof. They also did not
                    call Mr Adrian Tan, who is now the first defendant’s employee, to testify
                    that the April 2008 meeting did in fact take place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The second defendant’s story of
                    chancing upon the five GA drawings while looking through the old files of the
                    first defendant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> also did not seem credible, given that
                    no further evidence was adduced in support of this save for the assertions of
                    both defendants. I therefore found that, in all likelihood, it was the second
                    defendant who took the hard or soft copies or both of the plaintiff’s GA
                    drawings and passed them to the first defendant. In the circumstances, I found
                    that the alternative source alleged by the defendants was not proved on the
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As mentioned above, between the plaintiff and
                    the second defendant, there was an Employment agreement governing their
                    relationship at the material time as employer and employee. Any obligation of
                    confidence owed would therefore be set out by the express terms in that
                    agreement: <em>Ng-Loy</em> at [40.4.2]. The agreement
                    provided a duty of confidence to be imposed on the second defendant for a period
                    of 2 years post-employment (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>). That such a restrictive covenant of confidentiality would be
                    enforceable post-employment against the employee, thus ensuring that the
                    employer’s confidential information remained secret, gives force to the
                    concept of freedom of contract. This was recognised by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Man Financial</em> at [86] as one of the approaches
                    towards such restrictive covenant. (See further the discussion of the Court of
                    Appeal’s position in <em>Man Financial</em> at
                        <em>Ng-Loy</em> [40.4.13]-[40.4.14]). There would not
                    be any additional implied or equitable duty of confidence post-employment
                    arising over and above what was already expressly stipulated in the contractual
                    confidentiality clause, contrary to the suggestions by the plaintiff. On the
                    facts, there was a clear breach of the express contractual obligation of
                    confidence by the second defendant when he took the five GA drawings from the
                    plaintiff without permission and passed them to the first
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As an indirect recipient of the five GA
                    drawings and knowing their confidential nature, equity imposes on the first
                    defendant an obligation of confidence. This obligation bound the first defendant
                    from the moment it received the five confidential GA drawings from the second
                    defendant. Where there is no underlying contract, the elements required to
                    establish a breach of confidentiality were set out by Megarry J in <em>Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd</em> [1960] RPC 41: the
                    information must have the necessary quality of confidence about it, the
                    information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of
                    confidence and there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the
                    detriment of the party communicating it. This has been accepted locally in
                        <em>X Pte Ltd v CDE</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 575; [1992]
                    SGHC 229 at [27]. It has been established above that the five GA drawings were
                    confidential information and that an equitable obligation of confidence was
                    imposed on the first defendant in the circumstances. Therefore, the first
                    defendant’s use of the five GA drawings and its publication of them in its
                    catalogue and on its website was plainly unauthorised use of the confidential
                    information and a breach of its obligation of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Turning now to consider separately the
                    implications of the express 2-year limit placed by the plaintiff on the second
                    defendant’s duty of confidentiality in his Employment
                        agreement,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> I note that this duty would have expired on
                    1 August 2010. Therefore, on a plain reading of the clause, the second
                    defendant would be free to disclose the confidential information of the
                    plaintiff, including that of the plaintiff’s five GA drawings after that
                    date. Such was the effect of this contractual covenant and I did not think this
                    restriction unusual as it was not unimaginable that the plaintiff would take the
                    view that the technology behind the winches and hydraulic systems would advance
                    such that any information would become obsolete at the end of 2
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I shall conclude this section with a few words
                    on the springboard doctrine since the plaintiff sought alternatively to rely on
                    this to stop the first defendant from using the five confidential GA drawings
                    and gaining an unfair advantage in the winch business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The doctrine has been applied by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Tang Siew Choy v Certact Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 835; [1993] SGCA 35 at [33]-[35]. In
                        <em>Terrapin Ltd v Builders’ Supply Company (Hayes) Ltd
                        and Others</em> [1967] RPC 375, cited in the local High Court decision
                    of <em>Stratech Systems Limited v Guthrie Properties (S) Pte Ltd
                        and another</em> [2001] SGHC 77 at [40], the doctrine was articulated
                    as follows (at 391-392):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the essence of this branch of the law, whatever the origin of it
                        may be, is that a person who has obtained information in confidence is not
                        allowed to use it as a spring-board for activities detrimental to the person
                        who made the confidential communication, and spring-board it remains even
                        when all the features have been published or can be ascertained by actual
                        inspection by any member of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The rationale of this doctrine is that of
                    fairness, where persons receiving confidential information ought not to reap
                    where they have not sown to gain an unfair advantage against third parties who
                    lack the benefit of that information altogether: S Ricketson &amp; C Creswell,
                        <em>The Law of Intellectual Property: Copyright Designs &amp;
                        Confidential Information</em> (Lawbook Co, Thomson Reuters, 2003) at
                    [25.80]. A special disability will therefore be imposed on the defendant
                    confidant to ensure that it gains no head start over its competitors: <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> at 1016.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     However, it is pertinent to note that
                        <em>Murray v Yorkshire Fund Managers</em> (1997) 1 WLR
                    951 (“<em>Murray</em>”) at 960 has held that
                    the springboard doctrine would no longer be applicable where the information in
                    issue has ceased to be confidential. In my view, this is correct. The expiry of
                    the 2-year limit on 1 August 2010 in the contractual confidentiality clause
                    meant that the five GA drawings in issue were no longer confidential after that
                    date. Following the proposition of law set out in <em>Murray</em>, the springboard doctrine would therefore be inapplicable
                    at present to prevent the first defendant from using the plaintiff’s 5 GA
                    drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was a breach of the non-competition clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The non-competition clause in the second
                    defendant’s Employment agreement sought to prevent him from working with
                    businesses in competition with the plaintiff and its associated company within
                    Singapore and Malaysia for two years after his resignation from the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>CLAAS Medical Centre Pte
                        Ltd v Ng Boon Ching</em> [2010] 2 SLR 386; [2010] SGCA 3
                        (“<em>CLAAS</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    reiterated the basic principles on restraint of trade. While that case was
                    concerned with restrictive covenants in the context of a sale of business, the
                    Court of Appeal emphasised that the basic principles were general ones and were
                    applicable even in situations dealing with restrictive employment covenants. The
                    court in <em>CLAAS</em>, summarising the classic statement
                    of the law set out in the House of Lords’ decision in <em>Thorsten </em><em>Nordenfelt v The Maxim Nordenfelt
                        Guns and Ammunition Company, Limited</em> [1894] AC 535, stated at
                    [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]ll covenants in restraint of trade are <em>prima facie</em> void. However, they can be held to be valid if
                        the party seeking to rely on the restrictive covenant can show that,
                        firstly, the clause concerned is reasonable in the interests of the
                            <em>parties </em><em>and</em>,
                        secondly, the clause is also reasonable in the interests of the <em>public</em>. Additionally, there must be a legitimate
                        proprietary interest to be protected. As was held in <em>Man
                            Financial</em>, the court will only enforce the covenant if it
                        goes no further than necessary to protect the legitimate interests. There
                        cannot be a bare and blatant restriction of the freedom to trade …
                        Moreover, even where a legitimate proprietary interest is shown, the court
                        will ensure that the covenant in restraint of trade goes <em>no further than what is necessary</em> to protect the interest
                        concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Simply put, for a restraint of trade covenant
                    to be upheld, the plaintiff has to show that it has a legitimate proprietary
                    interest to be protected by the covenant and that the covenant is reasonable as
                    between the parties and the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Man
                    Financial</em>, the Court of Appeal discussed the practical application of
                    the above principles (at [72]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as the <em>application</em> of
                        the above-mentioned statement of principle is concerned, the following
                        paragraphs from the same work [i.e., <em>Butterworths Common
                            Law Series: the Law of Contract</em> (Michael Furmston gen ed)
                        (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003)] may be usefully noted (see <em>Butterworths Common Law Series</em> at paras 5.104-5105):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">However, the very process of balance means that the specific facts and
                            circumstances of each case become of vital importance. In addition, the
                            actual interpretation of the covenant(s) concerned must be done in
                                <em>context</em>, for a literal construction,
                            shorn of the context, could lead, inter alia, to the covenant(s)
                            concerned being unjustifiably struck down. However, the court will
                            always look to the substance rather than the form in which the
                            covenant(s) concerned are couched. And in a related vein, it is clear
                            that the courts will proscribe any indirect attempt to circumvent an
                            otherwise reasonable covenant, utilising (in the main) techniques of
                            construction of the covenant itself. In so far as the burden of proof is
                            concerned, this is on the party seeking to rely upon the covenant. The
                            crucial time for ascertaining whether or not the covenant in question is
                            in fact reasonable (or unreasonable, as the case may be) is the time at
                            which the contract is made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Generally speaking, two particular factors almost invariably arise for
                            reconsideration simply because they are almost always part and parcel of
                            the covenant itself in any event: the factors of <em>area</em> on the one hand and <em>time</em> on the other. The idea of physical space,
                            therefore, still remains a factor, although it cannot obviously be a
                            controlling one, as was the situation where the distinction between
                            general and partial restraints was concerned. There is, however, no
                            clear formula that would lead to a fairly predictable result. To take
                            the factor of time, for example, it has been held that a covenant that
                            literally fetters forever may be reasonable, having regard to the
                            specific circumstances of the case. Such was the holding of the House of
                            Lords in <em>Fitch v Dewes</em> [[1921] 2 AC 158],
                            where a solicitor’s clerk at a certain town agreed that, after
                            leaving the employer, he would never practise within seven miles of the
                            town hall. The very small radius of restraint was a significant factor
                            in the decision of the House, not only because the smallness of the town
                            meant that the employer had a real and legitimate interest to protect
                            but also because the covenantor had the rest of the United Kingdom
                            (indeed, the world) in which to practise. No one factor, therefore, is
                            decisive; the court has to examine all the circumstances as a whole and
                            decide accordingly. Some guidelines as to application may, however, be
                            discerned from the case law itself, in particular where established
                            categories are concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Court of Appeal in <em>Man
                        Financial</em> observed at [79] that bare and blatant restrictions of
                    the freedom to trade were not allowed and the employer had to have a legitimate
                    proprietary interest requiring protection in order for non-competition clauses
                    to be upheld. Here, I found such interest on the plaintiff’s part. The
                    marine winch industry is a relatively small and specialised one. This was
                    accepted by the second defendant himself during the trial. In the course of his
                    employment with the plaintiff, the second defendant received training in this
                    specialised field to build up his expertise in this area. It would not be too
                    far-fetched to point out that the plaintiff would have invested much time and
                    resources in this training. Thus the interest of the plaintiff requiring
                    protection by the non-competition clause was that of maintaining employees
                    well-versed and skilled in the plaintiff’s system of work such that it can
                    pursue its commercial activities successfully. If due protection of this
                    legitimate interest was not given, it would see the employees of the plaintiff,
                    upon receiving extensive specialised training by the plaintiff, leaving it soon
                    thereafter for its competitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The second defendant submitted that <em>Stratech Systems Ltd v Nyam Chiu Shin</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R)
                    579 (“<em>Stratech</em>”) at [48]-[49] stated
                    that where there was already another clause protecting confidential information
                    or trade secrets in the contract, the restraint of trade clause must cover a
                    legitimate proprietary interest beyond the protection of the confidential
                    information or trade secrets for it to be valid. He argued that as the plaintiff
                    here was already protected by a confidentiality clause, there was no legitimate
                    interest protectable by the non-competition clause in the same contract. While I
                    acknowledge the force of this argument, as I have explained earlier at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>, the plaintiff’s legitimate interest
                    protected here by the non-competition clause was not confidential information or
                    its trade secrets but that of building up and maintaining a pool of trained
                    skilled workers like the second defendant. As such, the proposition in the
                        <em>Stratech</em> case was not directly
                    applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Apart from establishing a legitimate interest,
                    the reasonableness of the scope of protection of the non-competition clause had
                    to be examined too. In this regard, the trade restrained, the geographical area
                    and the duration of the restraint would be considered. This inquiry was a
                    contextually and factually sensitive one with the circumstances to be considered
                    as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The non-competition clause here sought to
                    prevent the second defendant from working for firms directly or indirectly
                    engaged in businesses competing with the plaintiff and its associated
                    company’s business. As the plaintiff’s business was mainly that of
                    designing and manufacturing marine hydraulic and electrical installations,
                    preventing the second defendant from joining businesses in competition directly
                    or obliquely to it to protect its legitimate interests did not seem
                    unreasonable. The clause did not amount to a blanket prohibition to work for the
                    marine industry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Geographical area-wise, it has been
                    observed that the restricted area must have a reasonable nexus with the need to
                    protect the employer’s trade connections: Alexandra Kamerling and Chris
                    Goodwill, <em>Restrictive Covenants under Common and Competition
                        Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2010) at p 171. The restriction here encompassed Singapore and Malaysia. In
                    light of the business presence of the plaintiff and its associated company in
                    these two jurisdictions and the fact that this was a small and specialised
                    industry with only a select group of potential customers, the geographical
                    delimitation of the restraint was permissible. Besides, it is relevant to point
                    out that the second defendant, an Indonesian, had accepted that there were
                    marine industries of substantial sizes in Indonesia and Thailand and it was not
                    impossible for him to seek employment in those nearby countries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    Duration-wise, the restraint was for a period of 2 years post-employment. In
                    light of the specialised nature of the industry which the plaintiff was in and
                    the purpose of the non-competition clause here, this time restriction did not
                    seem unreasonable. While I noted that EMS’ and the first defendant’s
                    later employment contract with the second defendant had non-competition clauses
                    of only up to a year,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> the fact that the first
                    defendant’s initial employment contract had a 2-year non-competition
                        clause<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> gave some indication that a 2-year time
                    restriction could not be said to be wholly unreasonable in the marine industry.
                    The plaintiff also pointed out that a 2-year restrictive covenant was found
                    valid in <em>Heller Factoring (S) Ltd v Ng Tong Yang</em>
                    [1993] 1 SLR(R) 495 (“<em>Heller</em>”) where
                    the industry concerned was the factoring industry, also a specialised one. While
                    the second defendant argued that the time restriction was excessive as he was
                    only a mere mechanical design engineer working in the background like the
                    defendant in <em>Fellowes &amp; Sons v Fisher</em> [1976]
                    QB 122 who was a solicitor’s clerk, the time restriction in <em>Fellowes</em> was 5 years for a solicitor’s clerk, much
                    longer than the present 2-year period here. The court in that case nevertheless
                    saw it fit to uphold the validity of the clerk’s covenant against
                    canvassing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     More importantly, the second defendant was a
                    versatile individual employment wise and had shown a commendable aptitude
                    towards learning new skills to secure employment in other related and
                    non-related industries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> For instance, he joined EMS to learn
                    about rigs and had previously worked in his family business in Indonesia
                    designing automation. With his transferable skill sets and his ability to thrive
                    in different industries and in different countries, it was clear that the
                    non-competition clause here would not have a seriously adverse impact on his
                    livelihood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In my view therefore, the non-competition
                    clause here was valid. In the light of this, there was no need to discuss
                    possible severance of parts of the non-competition clause to preserve the
                    validity of non-offending parts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Separately, I would note the observation made
                    by Lord Greene MR in <em>Routh v Jones</em> [1947] 1 All ER
                    758 that while an employer is not entitled to stipulate for protection against
                    competition, the fact that a side effect of a legitimate covenant could
                    potentially prevent some competition did not mean that the covenant was thus
                    bad. Although the context of this case dealing with restrictive covenants was
                    that of customer connection and knowledge of customers’ peculiarities, it
                    could apply more generally to the present case as well. As such, I did not make
                    much of the second defendant’s argument that the function of the
                    plaintiff’s non-competition clause was simply to restrain
                    competition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I turn now to ascertain if the second
                    defendant breached this clause on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Factually, it was plain that the second
                    defendant breached this clause when he left the employment of the plaintiff to
                    join EMS on 1 August 2008, a company dealing with marine oil and gas
                    equipment. The plaintiff had regarded EMS as a competitor and the second
                    defendant did not deny this in cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     However it was also equally clear that the
                    breach was acquiesced by the plaintiff for about 16 months from the time the
                    second defendant started work at EMS because the plaintiff had in fact learnt
                    about the second defendant joining EMS soon after he did so but took no action
                    against him. While I recognise that acquiescence was raised in the pleadings in
                    a different way (see the Defence at para [16]), the facts in the finding above
                    were canvassed during the trial and in the closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The law on the defence of acquiescence has
                    been set out in Halsbury’s Laws of England vol 16
                        (4<sup>th</sup> Ed Reissue) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at para 924 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term acquiescence is … properly used <em>where a
                            person having a right and seeing another person about to commit, or in
                            the course of committing an act infringing that right, stands by in such
                            a manner as really to induce the person committing the act and who might

                        acquiescence may be defined as quiescence under such circumstances that
                        assent may reasonably be inferred from it and is no more than an instance of
                        the law of estoppels by words or conduct …</p>

                        Investment Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 355 at [27]. The plaintiff
                    here had knowledge of the second defendant joining EMS very soon after he left
                    the plaintiff. In fact, Loh admitted during cross-examination that he heard
                    about this when word spread in the plaintiff within a month or two after the
                    second defendant’s departure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> While there
                    was no doubt the plaintiff had a right to enforce the non-competition clause
                    then, the plaintiff, knowing that its right had been breached, chose not to act
                    and stood by for a considerable period of about 16 months thereafter, inducing
                    the second defendant to believe that it had consented to the
                breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     More importantly, I found that the
                    acquiescence must be regarded as extending to the second defendant joining the
                    first defendant on 1 December 2009 since the first breach of about 16
                    months was not acted upon by the plaintiff. While the plaintiff said during
                    cross-examination that it reserved its right to enforce the non-competition
                    clause against the second defendant,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> I was of the view
                    that any alleged reservation of rights by the plaintiff was a purely mental one,
                    not communicated at all to the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     If I am wrong in making the finding of
                    acquiescence, the breach by the second defendant would have been for a period of
                    8 months only, <em>i.e.</em>, from 1 December 2009 to
                    31 July 2010, because the non-competition clause would have expired after
                    that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reliefs sought</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relief for infringement of plaintiff’s copyright </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     An injunction would be granted against the
                    continued use of the plaintiff’s five GA drawings because of the
                    defendants’ copyright infringement and not because of the breach of their
                    obligation of confidentiality. This is so as the confidentiality clause
                    protecting the confidentiality of the five GA drawings had already expired on
                    1 August 2010 and there was no further existing obligation of
                    confidentiality to speak of presently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The plaintiff has abandoned its claim for an
                    account of profits as an alternative to damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     On the issue of damages, I was of the view
                    that this case did not warrant a separate damages inquiry for the copyright
                    infringement claim as there was no commercial loss shown to have been suffered
                    by the plaintiff and neither was there any apparent commercial benefit conferred
                    on the defendants. The second defendant averred at para [29] of his AEIC that
                    the first defendant had not manufactured or sold any winches based on the five
                    GA drawings. It thus appeared that the only real value derived from the five GA
                    drawings was the time and labour saved by the defendants in copying them instead
                    of creating original drawings. I therefore awarded the plaintiff statutory
                    damages as set out in section 119(2)(d) CA. I agreed with the plaintiff
                    concerning the purpose of CA statutory damages. The plaintiff pointed out that
                    the Parliamentary debates on the second reading of the Copyright (Amendment)
                    Bill 2004 indicated that statutory damages were introduced to aid a plaintiff
                    copyright owner when he encountered difficulty in proving actual losses from the
                        infringement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> This award would be in lieu of the
                    reliefs of damages or an account of profits. I note here that although the
                    plaintiff did not expressly elect for an award of statutory damages at the
                    outset in its statement of claim, it nevertheless did address the court on this
                    point in the course of its submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For ease of reference, the relevant statutory

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In working out the appropriate amount to award
                    as statutory damages and keeping in mind the statutory limitations provided in
                    section 119(2)(d)(i) and (ii) CA, I considered the second defendant’s
                    original contract with the first defendant which provided for a salary of
                    S$5,500, plus a bonus of S$10,000 for the first year of work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The total remuneration for the second defendant
                    for the first year of his employment with the first defendant would therefore be
                    a total of S$76,000 or S$208.20 per day on the basis of 365 days in a
                    year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     With respect to the amount of time it would
                    take for such a GA drawing to be created, the second defendant put it at 2
                        hours<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>
                    and while Loh was uncertain, he estimated it would be half a day to 2 or 3 days
                        approximately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Having regard to the background
                    preparation which may be required in producing the drawings, I found that the
                    second defendant would have taken no more than 3 days to complete each drawing
                    if he were to create original drawings similar to the five GA drawings in
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Therefore, in respect of five drawings, 15
                    days of work would be required by the second defendant. This would amount to a
                    total sum of S$3,123 or about S$625 per drawing, based on the rate of
                    remuneration of S$208.20 per day (see <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I also took into consideration the various
                    factors set out in section 119(5) CA. Firstly, as the plaintiff rightly
                    submitted, the nature and purpose of the defendants’ infringing acts were
                    commercial and were done with the intent of gearing themselves up as a potential
                    competitor of the plaintiff in the winch segment of the marine industry as
                    evidenced by the publication of the infringing drawings in its catalogue and on
                    its website for trade-related purposes. Secondly, the infringement was flagrant
                    as the second defendant’s story of finding the drawings incidentally while
                    searching through old files in the first defendant’s office could not be
                        true.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The defendants also made efforts to hide
                    the fact of their acts of copying for instance by simply changing the respective
                    names of the winches and flipping some of the profiles of the winches in the
                    plaintiff’s GA drawings from left to right in their own infringing
                        drawings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Little or no regret was
                    expressed by either defendant when they admitted to their infringing acts during
                    the course of the trial. Thirdly, it was clear that the defendants did benefit
                    from being spared the expense of time and effort in preparing and doing the GA
                    drawings when they simply copied from the plaintiff’s works. I acknowledge
                    the need to deter such infringements going forward, considering the unfair
                    nature of the appropriation of the work of others. There was also some semblance
                    of bad faith when the first defendant continued using and publishing the
                    infringing drawings in the catalogue and website despite the plaintiff
                    indicating in its letter of demand that that was an infringement of its
                    copyright. More importantly, the conduct of proceedings by the defendants was
                    less than satisfactory. For one, they had raised defences earlier in their
                    pleadings which were unsupportable on the facts of the case, such as the
                    non-expert defence and the industrial application defence. Both of these were
                    eventually abandoned when the trial commenced. Also, the defendants had pleaded
                    in their defence at paras <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>-<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> that building 3-dimensional articles from the
                    drawings would not infringe the plaintiff’s copyright. This had resulted
                    in an erroneous impression that the defendants had already manufactured winches
                    based on the plaintiff’s GA drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the light of the s 119(5) CA factors
                    considered above and the approximate value of the drawings (see <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above), I decided that an award of statutory
                    damages of S$5,000 per drawing would be appropriate in the circumstances. The
                    total statutory damages awarded to the plaintiff in respect of its copyright
                    infringement claim would therefore be a total of $25,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Additionally, I ordered both defendants to
                    deliver up and to forfeit all hard and soft copies of the 5 GA drawings to the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors or to file and serve an affidavit that those
                    drawings have been destroyed and/or deleted. This was to be done within 10 days
                    from the date of the pronouncement of my decision in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relief for breach of obligation of confidentiality </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As the 2-year time restriction stipulated in
                    the confidentiality clause in the second defendant’s employment agreement
                    has since expired, no injunction would be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The plaintiff has abandoned its claim for an
                    account of profits as an alternative to damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     No further damages would be awarded to the
                    plaintiff on this ground. Given that the breach of confidentiality claim
                    involved the same five GA drawings, the damages under this claim could be
                    subsumed in the statutory damages awarded for copyright
                infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relief for breach of non-competition clause </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     No injunction would be granted to enforce the
                    non-competition clause as the 2-year period of restriction in the clause has
                    since expired. Similarly, no injunction would be granted in the light of my
                    finding above that the plaintiff had acquiesced in the breach of the
                    non-competition clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     If I am wrong on the finding of the
                    plaintiff’s acquiescence, considering that the plaintiff has not shown any
                    damages suffered as a result of the eight-month breach, I would only award it
                    nominal damages set at S$5,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In summary, on the issue of liability, I found
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     Both defendants are liable for
                        infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright in the five GA
                        drawings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both
                        defendants are liable for breach of their confidentiality obligations
                        imposed on them concerning the five GA drawings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     The second defendant is not liable for
                        breaching the non-competition clause due to acquiescence on the part of the
                        plaintiff in not enforcing its rights under this clause upon the first
                        breach by the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     On the matter of relief, I ordered as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_a"></a>(a)     For copyright infringement, an
                        injunction was granted against continued use of the five GA drawings,
                        statutory damages of S$25,000 were awarded and the defendants were to
                        deliver up and forfeit the five GA drawings in issue or to file and serve an
                        affidavit affirming the destruction and/or deletion of the drawings within
                        10 days from the date of my decision;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_b"></a>(b)     For breach of confidentiality, no injunction was granted
                        and no damages were awarded as they could be subsumed in the statutory
                        damages awarded for the copyright infringement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_95-p2_c"></a>(c)     For breach of non-competition clause,
                        no injunction was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I turn now to address the issue of
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The plaintiff argued in this regard that a
                    clause in the employment agreement stipulated that costs would be paid by the
                    second defendant to the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. The clause (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) is set out again below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event of any breach of the abovesaid provisions, the Company shall
                        be entitled to forthwith terminate your employment without payment in lieu
                        of notice or, as the case may be, compensation, but the Company otherwise
                        reserves all its rights against you in respect of any such breach and you
                        are to indemnify the Company against all lost or damage suffered by the
                        Company as a result of any such breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I disagreed with the plaintiff’s
                    submissions that the above clause provided for indemnity costs in the context of
                    the restrictive covenants. It did not provide explicitly for costs to be paid by
                    the employee on an indemnity basis in the event of breach of the stipulated
                    covenants. The words “all los[s] or damage suffered” ought not to
                    be read, in the context in which they appear, as extending to costs as well. If
                    the plaintiff had intended to have legal costs paid by its employee on an
                    indemnity basis, it ought to have provided for such in much clearer
                    language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In the absence of a contractual provision
                    stipulating that costs would be payable on an indemnity basis, such indemnity
                    costs may still be awarded where there are special or exceptional circumstances
                    to do so, such as when a party acted unreasonably in the proceedings: <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur John and others</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    840; [1996] SGHC 73 at [30], and <em>Teo Siew Peng and another v
                        Neo Hock Pheng and others</em> [1999] 1 SLR 293; [1998] SGHC 312 at
                    [34]. While the defendants’ conduct was far from exemplary in so far as
                    some of the issues were concerned (see <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>
                    above), their conduct of the trial as a whole did not amount to the sort of
                    unreasonable behaviour that should attract the sanction of indemnity
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I therefore ordered the costs of the trial
                    to be paid by both defendants on the standard basis and for such costs to be
                    agreed or taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In view of the amount of statutory damages
                    of S$25,000 awarded, which did not exceed the District Court limit, I invited
                    submissions on whether costs should be awarded on the High Court or the
                    Subordinate Courts scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The plaintiff submitted two points in favour
                    of the High Court scale of costs. Relying on the High Court decision of
                        <em>Cheong Ghim </em><em>Fah and another
                        v Murugian </em><em>s/o Rangasamy</em> [2004] 3
                    SLR(R) 193; [2004] SGHC 125 (“<em>Cheong Ghim
                        </em><em>Fah</em>”) at [14], the plaintiff
                    submitted firstly that, pursuant to s 39(6) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap
                    321, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCA”), it had reasonable grounds at the outset
                    to take the view that it would recover damages in excess of the Subordinate
                    Courts’ jurisdiction. This was because the defendants had created the
                    misleading impression that they had manufactured and sold winches based on the
                    plaintiff’s five GA drawings. Given this impression and the fact that
                    winches were expensive equipment costing between S$500,000 and S$800,000 each,
                    the plaintiff argued that they did have a reasonable basis to believe that the
                    amount of damages awarded would be more than S$250,000. Secondly, the plaintiff
                    submitted that the present case was a complex one concerning the first case on
                    statutory damages for copyright and also the springboard doctrine which had not
                    been discussed in great detail by previous local decisions. On the other hand,
                    the defendants argued that the case was not one of great complexity. It involved
                    only preliminary GA drawings of winches and not the building of winches. While
                    winches were expensive, the drawings were not. The defendants also submitted
                    that the points of law canvassed at the trial were not novel. They therefore
                    contended that costs ought to be awarded on the Subordinate Courts
                scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I agreed with the plaintiff’s first
                    argument. The High Court in <em>Cheong Ghim </em><em>Fah</em> observed that s 39 SCA and O 59 r 27(5) of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) allow proceedings to be initiated in the
                    High Court only where there was a sufficient reason to do so, such as when there
                    were reasonable grounds to believe that the damages recoverable would exceed the
                    District Court’s jurisdiction. It noted at [14] that the assessment of
                    reasonableness ought to be seen in the light of the factual circumstances when
                    proceedings were initiated. In the light of the impression that the defendants
                    gave during most part of the litigation that they had already made
                    three-dimensional winches, I found the plaintiff did have reasonable grounds for
                    believing that the damages recoverable would be beyond the District
                    Court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As for the plaintiff’s second
                    argument, I did not think the present case was of that requisite “unusual
                    complexity” as described by the court in <em>Cheong Ghim
                        </em><em>Fah</em> at [17]. While it appeared that
                    this was the first case addressing the application of the s 119(5) CA factors in
                    ascertaining the quantum of the CA statutory damages award, I did consider
                    similar factors in applying s 119(4) CA when determining the quantum of
                    additional damages under s 119(4) CA in <em>New Line Productions,
                        Inc and another v Aglow Video Pte Ltd and others and other suits</em>
                    [2005] 3 SLR(R) 660; [2005] SGHC 118. Further, the springboard doctrine has
                    already been discussed, albeit briefly, in local decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Accordingly, I ordered that costs of the
                    proceedings be awarded to the plaintiff on the High Court scale.</p>
