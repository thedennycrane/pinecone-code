<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, who was the director of Realm
                    Capital Limited (“Realm Capital”), had applied in Originating
                    Summons (Bankruptcy) No 15 of 2015 (“OSB 15”) to set aside a
                    statutory demand dated 14 October 2014 for a sum of $2,209,863.01 (“the
                    SD”) which was served on him through his solicitors on 15 October 2014.
                    Prior to OSB 15, the defendant had commenced bankruptcy proceedings against the
                    plaintiff in Originating Summons (Bankruptcy) No 2552 of 2014 (OSB
                2552).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In OSB 15, the plaintiff applied for (a) an
                    extension of time to make the application to set aside the SD issued against
                    him; (b) the SD to be set aside; and (c) alternatively, that the SD be declared
                    manifestly irregular, invalid, null and void and of no effect. The assistant
                    registrar dismissed the plaintiff’s application in OSB 15. The plaintiff
                    appealed and the matter came before me. After hearing the parties, I dismissed
                    the appeal. As the plaintiff has filed an appeal against my decision, I now give
                    my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Extension of time to set aside the SD</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Under r 97(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, s 166, 2006 Rev Ed), the plaintiff had 14 days
                    from the date on which the SD was served to apply to court to set aside the SD.
                    The SD was served on 15 October 2015 (the plaintiff disputed that this was valid
                    service but this was irrelevant to the immediate issue at hand) which meant that
                    an application to set aside the SD had to be made by end October 2014. The
                    plaintiff filed OSB 15 on 24 February 2015. This was almost 4 months out of
                    time. However, under r 97(3), the court was empowered to grant an extension of
                    time to a debtor to make his application to set aside a statutory
                demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In <em>Rafat Ali Rizvi v Ing Bank
                        NV Hong Kong Branch</em> [2011] SGHC 114, Kan Ting Chiu J provided the
                    following four factors that the court would have to take into consideration when
                    an application for an extension of time was made by a debtor: (a) the period of
                    the delay; (b) the reasons for the delay; the grounds for setting aside the
                    statutory demand; and (d) the prejudice that might result from an extension of
                    time (at [32]). The weightage of each factor was not cast in stone but was fact
                    dependent. In that case, Kan J noted that a delay of eight days was quite long
                    and the reasons provided for the delay were not strong. Nevertheless, the
                    extension was granted since the plaintiff had presented a good case that the
                    statutory demand should be set aside for non-compliance with s 61(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) and the
                    extension would not have prejudiced the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In <em>Oversea-Chinese Banking
                        Corp Ltd v Ravichandran s/o Suppiah</em> [2015] SGHC 1, Aedit Abdullah
                    JC held that a delay of about a year did not disqualify the defendant from
                    making an attempt at setting aside the statutory demand. In that case, the
                    defendant had been acting in person for a substantial period of that
                    delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In <em>Thu Aung Zaw v Norb
                        Creative Studio</em> [2014] SGHC 67, the plaintiff’s application
                    was made more than four months out time and no separate application for an
                    extension of time was made. Despite this, Lee Seiu Kin J waived the procedural
                    irregularity of the plaintiff and permitted the application to set aside the
                    statutory demand. The court was of the opinion that there was no substantial
                    injustice or prejudice suffered by the defendant as a consequence of the
                    irregularity. The court then dispensed with the application for an extension of
                    time and proceeded to hear the application. It thus seemed to me that the
                    threshold to grant an application for an extension of time to a debtor to make
                    his application to set aside a statutory demand was not a particularly high
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In this case, there was a substantial delay of
                    about four months. The plaintiff was represented during this time but claimed
                    that he was not satisfied with the services provided by his solicitors at that
                    time. The plaintiff then discharged his solicitors and acted in person after
                    that. He further claimed that he only received the documents pertaining to his
                    bankruptcy proceedings on 17 February 2015. I did not find this to be a
                    sufficient reason to account for the delay. Counsel for the defendant pointed
                    out that the plaintiff’s solicitors had appeared at the first hearing of
                    OSB 2552 on 22 January 2015. At that hearing, the plaintiff was granted an
                    adjournment as he, through his solicitors, had expressed an intention to make a
                    settlement offer to the defendant. The defendant did not accept the offer. This
                    showed that the plaintiff was well aware of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings
                    against him following the service of the SD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       However, the defendant did not point to any
                    prejudice suffered by him as a result of the delay. Moreover, one ground relied
                    on the plaintiff to set aside the SD was that service of the SD was irregular.
                    This could have had an impact on the application for extension of time since it
                    was potentially arguable that r 97(1) of the Bankruptcy Rules proceeded on the
                    assumption that service of the SD was valid. I therefore proceeded to hear the
                    substantive merits of the plaintiff application to set aside the SD. In any
                    event, I found that the plaintiff’s application to set aside the SD was
                    without any merit. Therefore, the granting of the extension was not material to
                    my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s arguments to set aside the SD</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First argument: service of the SD was not valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had
                    failed to effect personal service of the SD as required by r 96(2) of the
                    Bankruptcy Rules. The defendant did not deny that no personal service was
                    effected on the plaintiff. The SD was served on the plaintiff’s solicitors
                    (at that time). In a letter dated 3 October 2014, the defendant’s
                    solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors asking whether they had
                    instructions to accept service of process (including service of statutory
                    demands) on the plaintiff’s behalf. The plaintiff’s solicitors
                    replied that they had instructions to accept service on behalf of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Re Rasmachayana Sulistyo
                        (alias Chang Whe Ming), ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd
                        and other appeals</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 483 (“<em>Re Rasmachayana</em>”), V K Rajah J (as he then was)
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    The requirements for service of the statutory
                            demand are circumscribed by pragmatism and not by an overtly [<em>sic</em>] rigid and technical approach. The emphasis
                            is clearly on the <em>reasonableness</em> of the
                            steps being taken to bring to the debtor's attention the existence of
                            the relevant statutory demand. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    … There is nothing in the [Bankruptcy Rules]
                            or [Bankruptcy Act] pointing to the existence of a legislative scheme
                            for an exclusive code of procedure for personal service. More
                            importantly, there is nothing in the [Bankruptcy Rules] that precludes
                            or militates against consensual arrangements for service of processes.
                            In my view, the freedom to contract should not be fettered unless there
                            is a clear contrary indication from the language used or from the
                            purport of the relevant legislative provisions and/or underpinning
                            public interest considerations. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    … [T]here are no <em>apparent</em> underpinning or overriding policy reasons why a
                            debtor cannot agree to have the various bankruptcy processes effected on
                            him in a particular or peculiar manner that is agreeable and/or
                            convenient to both him and the creditor. Financial institutions
                            frequently deal with foreign debtors and it is sometimes wholly
                            impractical and extremely costly for attempts to be made for service
                            through a foreign judicial process. However, impracticality or
                            difficulties <em>per se</em> cannot be a license to
                            obviate a mandatory statutory scheme or policy. The crux of the matter
                            really is whether parties can contractually agree on alternative
                            modalities of service.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In <em>Wong Kwei Cheong v
                        ABN-AMRO Bank NV</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 31 (“<em>Wong Kwei Cheong</em>”), S Rajendran J accepted a suggestion
                    by counsel that the bank could have complied with r 96(1) of the Bankruptcy
                    Rules by notifying the debtor’s solicitors of the statutory demand and
                    inquiring whether they would accept service on behalf of the debtor (at [14]).
                    Both <em>Re Rasmachayana</em> and <em>Wong
                        Kwei Cheong</em> showed that service through the debtor’s
                    solicitors was sufficient to comply with r 96 of the Bankruptcy Rules if there
                    was a prior arrangement that such a manner of service was agreeable to the
                    debtor. This was exactly the situation in the present case where the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors had confirmed that they had instructions to accept
                    service of process on behalf of the plaintiff. Furthermore, the plaintiff did
                    not make any allegation that his solicitors had falsely represented this
                    information when the defendant’s solicitors specifically asked the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors whether they had instructions to accept service of
                    process, including but not limited to the service of statutory demands on behalf
                    of their clients. I therefore found that there was valid service of the SD under
                    r 96 of the Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second argument: there was a genuine triable issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff also claimed that there was a
                    dispute as to the debt which gave rise to a genuine triable issue. It was on
                    this basis that the plaintiff claimed that the SD should be set
                aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Rule 98(2)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the Bankruptcy Rules provided that the court had to set aside a statutory demand
                    if the debt was disputed on grounds which appeared to the court to be
                    substantial. Paragraph 144(3) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions provided
                    additional guidance on the matter by stating that the “Court [would]
                    normally set aside the statutory demand if, in its opinion, on the evidence
                    there was a <em>genuine triable issue</em>”
                    (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Court of Appeal in <em>Mohd
                        Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                        and another appeal</em> [2014] 2 SLR 446 explained that the court was
                    not obliged to set aside a statutory demand where there was a genuine triable
                    issue but it would only normally do so, and that “the criterion of
                    ‘grounds which appear to the court to be substantial’ under r
                        98(2)(<em>b</em>) constitute[d] a higher
                    threshold” (at [29]). The Court of Appeal further explained at
                    [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t will not suffice for a debtor to raise spurious allegations
                        in order to fend off bankruptcy proceedings. The court must examine
                            <em>all the facts</em> to ascertain whether the
                        “genuine triable issue” test in para 144 of the [Supreme
                        Court] Practice Directions is satisfied. The upshot of this is that the
                        court will only set aside a statutory demand (and thereby require a creditor
                        to initiate a civil suit if he wishes to pursue the claimed debt further)
                        where the debtor is able to adduce evidence on affidavit that raises a
                        genuine triable issue. [emphasis in original]</p>

                        alia</em>, the plaintiff for an unpaid loan, which total sum was
                    $4,000,000, in exchange for the plaintiff paying $1,500,000 by 4 September 2012
                    and a further sum of $500,000 by 9 September 2012 (“the Settlement
                    Payments”). The forbearance period was extended to May 2014 through three
                    Supplemental Deeds. It was also not disputed that the plaintiff had made the
                    Settlement Payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Clause 1.1(ii) of the Deed of Settlement also
                    provided that the aggregate liabilities and obligations of, <em>inter alia</em>, the plaintiff towards the defendant and Ever Tycoon
                    after the Settlement Payments would not exceed $2,000,000. This was referred to
                    in the Deed of Settlement as the “Balance Principal”. Under cl 1.3
                    of the Deed of Settlement, the plaintiff and defendant agreed to, “in
                    good faith, seek to discuss the reinvestment or settlement of the Balance
                    Principal [and] such discussions [were] to be concluded no later than 1 March
                    2013”. The Supplemental Deeds extended this period of discussion up till
                    1 May 2014. Clause 2.4 of the third Supplemental Deed provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to Clauses 1.3 and 1.4 of
                        the Deed of Settlement (as amended by the Supplemental Deed,
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental Deed and this
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Supplemental Deed), the Parties agree
                        that in the event [the defendant] and [the plaintiff] fail to conclude any
                        reinvestment or settlement of the Balance Principal by 1 May 2014 (or such
                        later date as [the defendant] and Ever Tycoon may agree in writing), [the
                        plaintiff] and Realm Capital shall jointly and/or severally forthwith pay to
                        [the defendant] the Balance Principal of S$2,000,000, in addition to all
                        accrued interest thereof at the rate of 5% per annum on a simple, daily rest
                        basis under Clause 1.4 of the Deed of Settlement (as amended by the
                        Supplemental Deed, 2<sup>nd</sup> Supplemental Deed and this
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Supplemental Deed) from 9 September 2012
                        until the date of full payment. In this regard, [the defendant] shall be at
                        liberty to claim against [the plaintiff] and Realm Capital jointly and/or
                        severally for payment of the Balance Principal of S$2,000,000 (and accrued
                        interest thereof) in any manner and in his absolute discretion under this
                        clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The SD in this case was for the Balance
                    Principal of $2,000,000. The plaintiff argued that there was double claiming by
                    the defendant of the sum of $1,500,000 which was previously paid by the
                    plaintiff. This according to the plaintiff raised a genuine triable issue. I did
                    not agree. From the above, it was manifestly apparent that the SD was for a
                    separate sum, which was the Balance Principal. The $1,500,000 previously paid by
                    the plaintiff was for the Settlement Payments. There was clearly no double
                    claiming. It was a spurious allegation raised by the plaintiff in a desperate
                    attempt to fend off the bankruptcy proceedings against him. There was no merit
                    in this submission and I found that there was no dispute relating to the debt
                    which was substantial under r 98(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Third argument: details of the debt provided were
                insufficient</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was a requirement under r 94(4)(<em>b</em>), that a statutory demand stated the consideration for
                    the debt or if there was no consideration, the way in which the debt arose. If
                    the debt was founded on grounds other than a judgment or an order of court, the
                    SD had to give such details as would enable to debtor to identify the
                    debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff claimed that insufficient
                    details were provided because the defendant failed to annex the documents
                    relating to the debt to the SD. It was argued that in order to constitute
                    sufficient details, the Deed of Settlement under which the debt arose and other
                    Supplemental Deeds relating to the debt and other personal guarantees had to be
                    annexed to the SD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This argument was misconceived. Rule
                        94(4)(<em>b</em>) did not require that documents
                    relating to the debt be attached. All it required was for details of the debt to
                    be provided so that the debtor could identify the debt. The rationale behind
                    this requirement was clear. Failure to comply with or set aside a statutory
                    demand after 21 days of service of the statutory demand triggered a presumption
                    under s 62 of the Bankruptcy Act that the debtor was unable to pay any debt
                    within the meaning of s 61(1)(<em>c</em>). In order to
                    comply with a statutory demand so that the presumption would not be triggered, a
                    debtor had to be able to identify the debt. If not, he could not possibly be
                    expected to comply with a statutory demand. For this purpose to be achieved, the
                    documents relating to the debt did not have to be attached if sufficient details
                    were provided in order for the debtor to identify the debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the present case, the SD stated that the
                    debt arose from a loan granted by the defendant and Ever Tycoon to the plaintiff
                    and Realm Capital. The SD further provided the date of the Deed of Settlement
                    entered into by the parties (4 September 2012) and the names of the parties to
                    the Deed of Settlement (under which the current debt arose). It even provided
                    the dates of the Supplemental Deeds entered into and the date of the letter of
                    demand made by the plaintiff and Ever Tycoon Limited. It also provided the
                    amount owing and the interest accrued on the principal. It also explained how
                    the accrued interest was calculated based on the interest rate stipulated in
                    clause 1.4 of the Deed of Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As the plaintiff had appended his signature as
                    a party to the Deed of Settlement and all the three Supplemental Deeds, I
                    expected the plaintiff to retain a copy of these important documents after due
                    execution by all the parties concerned. At the hearing before me, I asked the
                    plaintiff, who was in person, whether he had a copy of these documents. He
                    candidly admitted that he did have them. Accordingly, there would be no question
                    that he would have fully understood what the outstanding sum referred to in the
                    SD was all about and how it arose, since he would have been able to read the SD
                    in conjunction with the Deed of Settlement and the three Supplement Deeds that
                    were in his possession at all times. In light of this, sufficient details were
                    clearly given to enable the plaintiff to identify the debt. I therefore found
                    that the SD was in compliance with r 94(4)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the Bankruptcy Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In conclusion, I found that (a) there was
                    valid service of the SD under r 96 of the Bankruptcy Rules; (b) there was no
                    genuine triable issue; and (c) sufficient details of the debt were provided in
                    the SD to enable the plaintiff to identify the debt under r 94(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Bankruptcy Rules. As none of the
                    plaintiff’s arguments had any substantive merits, I dismissed his appeal
                    against the decision of the assistant registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After hearing the parties on costs, I ordered
                    that the plaintiff pay the defendant costs (inclusive of disbursements) fixed at
                    $2,500.</p>
