        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the appellant, RecordTV Pte
                    Ltd (“RecordTV”), against the decision of a High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”), who dismissed its claim against the respondents,
                    MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd, MediaCorp TV12 Singapore Pte Ltd, MediaCorp News
                    Pte Ltd and MediaCorp Studios Pte Ltd (collectively referred to as
                    “MediaCorp”), for making groundless threats to bring legal
                    proceedings for copyright infringement. The Judge also held, <em>vis-à-vis</em> MediaCorp’s counterclaim against RecordTV for
                    copyright infringement, that RecordTV was liable in its use of an Internet-based
                    digital video recorder (“iDVR”) to record shows broadcast by
                    MediaCorp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This appeal raises an important policy issue as
                    to how the courts should interpret copyright legislation in the light of
                    technological advances which have clear legitimate and beneficial uses for the
                    public, but which may be circumscribed or stymied by expansive claims of
                    existing copyright owners. Bearing in mind that the law strives to encourage
                    both creativity and innovation for the common good, in a case such as the
                    present one, how should the courts strike a just and fair balance between the
                    interests of all affected stakeholders, <em>viz</em>,
                    consumers, content providers as well as technology and service vendors? If the
                    law is not clear as to whether the use of improved technology which is
                    beneficial to society constitutes a breach of copyright, should the courts
                    interpret legislative provisions to favour the private rights of the copyright
                    owner or the public’s wider interests? This is the problem that we face
                    and have to resolve in the present case. In the normal course of events, when
                    enacting a statute, the Legislature balances the rights and interests of all
                    affected stakeholders after considering the social costs and the economic
                    implications. Where the statute is not clear, however, the courts have to
                    perform this difficult task. In the present case, the Judge struck the balance
                    in favour of MediaCorp, the copyright owner, by giving an expansive
                    interpretation to the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act (Cap 63,
                    2006 Rev Ed). His detailed reasons can be found in <em>RecordTV Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd and others</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 152 (“the Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       RecordTV was the owner of an Internet-based
                    service that allowed its registered users (referred to hereafter as either
                    “Registered Users” or a “Registered User”, as the
                    context requires) to request the recording of MediaCorp’s free-to-air
                    broadcasts in Singapore. The broadcasts were recorded on RecordTV’s iDVR,
                    which functioned just like a traditional digital video recorder
                    (“DVR”), <em>viz</em>, a Registered User
                    could select a programme to record, play back and/or delete. The main difference
                    between RecordTV’s iDVR and a traditional DVR was that the former was a
                    remote-storage DVR. This meant that the recording was made at RecordTV’s
                    premises, with the Registered Users operating the iDVR system remotely from home
                    or elsewhere via a web browser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       MediaCorp is a state-owned group of commercial
                    media companies in Singapore. It is the nation’s largest media broadcaster
                    and provider, and broadcasts a variety of free-to-air television programmes in
                    Singapore. For present purposes, MediaCorp is also the copyright owner of the
                    various free-to-air broadcasts and films particularised below (referred to
                    hereafter as either the “MediaCorp shows” or a “MediaCorp
                    show”, as the context requires), whose copyright RecordTV is alleged to
                    have infringed:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RecordTV’s iDVR service – a time-shifting
                service</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       RecordTV’s iDVR service operated as
                    follows. Members of the public had to first register with RecordTV (<em>ie</em>, they had to become Registered Users) before they
                    could use its iDVR free-of-charge. Access to the iDVR was restricted to those
                    Registered Users who were legally entitled to view and record the MediaCorp
                    shows, all of which (as just mentioned) were broadcast on a free-to-air basis
                    (see cl 3A of RecordTV’s terms of use (“the Terms of
                        Use”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> which is discussed
                    in greater detail at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> below). These
                    Registered Users were, in the main, Registered Users based in Singapore who held
                    valid television licences. In this regard, it should be noted that all members
                    of the public in Singapore who hold valid television licences are in effect
                    licensed by MediaCorp to view the MediaCorp shows as the Media Development
                    Authority (“MDA”) has granted a licence to MediaCorp to provide,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, free-to-air broadcasts in
                    Singapore, and this MDA-granted licence requires MediaCorp to provide shows to
                    persons in Singapore who hold valid television licences without requiring the
                    payment of any subscription fees in return. By virtue of s 114 of the
                    Copyright Act, persons in Singapore who hold valid television licences can also
                    make copies of the MediaCorp shows for their own “private and
                    domestic” use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Reverting to RecordTV’s iDVR service, upon
                    a successful registration with RecordTV and a subsequent log-in using a unique
                    username and password, a Registered User was able to access a database which
                    listed the shows available for recording using RecordTV’s iDVR, namely,
                    the MediaCorp shows scheduled for broadcast over the coming week on
                    Channel 5, Channel 8 or Channel NewsAsia (this database was compiled
                    by RecordTV using information from the public websites of the respective
                    channels). The Registered User would select from this database the MediaCorp
                    shows which he wanted to have recorded and enter the selected shows into a
                    playlist. After making his selection, the Registered User would issue a request
                    for RecordTV’s iDVR to record the desired shows. This request would be
                    updated in the iDVR’s internal database. A control programme in
                    RecordTV’s recording computers, which were located away from the
                    Registered User’s computer, would continuously monitor the iDVR’s
                    internal database to check whether a request had been made. If the control
                    programme detected that a Registered User had made a request for a particular
                    MediaCorp show to be recorded, it would instruct the iDVR to record the said
                    show.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       RecordTV operated several television tuners (one
                    per television channel) from which its iDVR captured and recorded those
                    MediaCorp shows which Registered Users had requested to be recorded. Depending
                    on the mode of storage in which the iDVR operated (which could be the
                    “Single Instance Storage” (“SIS”) mode, the
                    “Mixed” mode or the “Multiple Copy” mode (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> below)), either one copy or multiple
                    copies of the recording of a MediaCorp show would be stored in RecordTV’s
                    recording computers. After the recording had been made, the Registered User who
                    had requested for the recording would be able to play it back on his
                    computer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is important to note that each recording of a
                    MediaCorp show could only be retrieved by the Registered User who had requested
                    that that particular show be recorded. This recording would be
                    “streamed” to the Registered User, rather than
                    “downloaded” onto his computer (as to the difference between
                    “streaming” and “downloading”, see the Judgment at
                    [97]–[98]; see also <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> below). The
                    Registered User would then be able to view the recording until either RecordTV
                    or the Registered User himself removed that recording from the latter’s
                    playlist. It was the practice of RecordTV to delete all recordings of the
                    MediaCorp shows from its recording computers 15 days after the date of recording
                    (which would also be the date of broadcast of the respective shows). In effect,
                    RecordTV provided a time-shifting service to the Registered Users by means of
                    its iDVR, such that a Registered User could view, for a period of up to 15 days
                    after the date of broadcast, a MediaCorp show recorded at his
                request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       RecordTV’s iDVR had three different phases
                    of operation during its lifespan. When it was first launched in July 2007, it
                    operated in the SIS mode. This mode of file storage involved the storage in
                    RecordTV’s recording computers of one copy of the time-shifted recording
                    of a MediaCorp show, regardless of the number of recording requests made for
                    that show. By July 2008, RecordTV’s iDVR was operating in the
                    “Mixed” mode for Channels 5 and 8, and in the
                    “Multiple Copy” mode for Channel NewsAsia. The
                    “Mixed” mode was a hybrid mode of storage whereby multiple copies
                    of the recording of a MediaCorp show were created based on the number of
                    Registered Users who had requested the recording of that show. If, however,
                    system resources were insufficient, then only one copy of the recording would be
                    made. As for the “Multiple Copy” mode, it involved the making and
                    storage of multiple copies of the recording of the same MediaCorp show, such
                    that that show could be played back from different files. Finally, sometime
                    around August to September 2008, RecordTV’s iDVR was reconfigured to
                    operate solely in the “Multiple Copy” mode for all channels. The
                    one similarity among all three phases was that RecordTV would not make a
                    recording of a MediaCorp show if it did not receive a recording request for that
                    show. It should be noted that the third phase of operation of RecordTV’s
                    iDVR (<em>ie</em>, the phase during which only the
                    “Multiple Copy” mode of storage was used) was implemented only
                    after RecordTV had commenced its action against MediaCorp.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Litigation between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The dispute between RecordTV and MediaCorp
                    crystallised when the latter issued cease-and-desist letters to the former
                    objecting to the former’s introduction in July 2007 of its time-shifting
                    service by means of its iDVR. MediaCorp alleged that the use of the iDVR
                    infringed its copyright in the MediaCorp shows. In response, RecordTV commenced
                    an action against MediaCorp for, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    making groundless threats to bring legal proceedings for copyright infringement
                    (see s 200(1) of the Copyright Act). MediaCorp in turn filed a counterclaim
                    seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, injunctive relief for
                    copyright infringement. At the conclusion of a long trial, the Judge reserved
                    judgment. He eventually dismissed RecordTV’s claim and allowed
                    MediaCorp’s counterclaim against RecordTV for copyright infringement.
                    Dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision, RecordTV appealed to this
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our approach in this appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the present appeal, we are only concerned
                    with MediaCorp’s copyright in the MediaCorp shows in terms of the right
                    to: (a) make copies of (<em>ie</em>, reproduce);
                    (b) communicate to the public; and/or (c) authorise the copying and/or
                    the communication to the public of those shows. The Judge found that RecordTV,
                    in providing its iDVR service to Registered Users who held valid television
                    licences such that they could access the MediaCorp shows on a time-shifted
                    basis, had not infringed MediaCorp’s right to reproduce those shows.
                    However, he found that RecordTV had communicated the MediaCorp shows to the
                    public and had also authorised them to copy the same, and was therefore liable
                    for copyright infringement. He further held that RecordTV could not rely on any
                    of the safe harbour or fair dealing provisions under, respectively, Pt IXA
                    and s 109 of the Copyright Act to escape liability for copyright
                    infringement. In view of his ruling that MediaCorp’s counterclaim against
                    RecordTV for copyright infringement was made out, the Judge dismissed
                    RecordTV’s claim against MediaCorp for making groundless threats to bring
                    infringement proceedings. In this appeal, we shall adopt the same approach as
                    the Judge and likewise assess the merits of RecordTV’s claim by reference
                    to our ruling on MediaCorp’s counterclaim.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues to be decided in MediaCorp’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the light of the provisions of the
                    Copyright Act reproduced above, three main issues arise for consideration before
                    us <em>vis-à-vis</em> MediaCorp’s counterclaim,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, whether RecordTV copied the
                        MediaCorp shows (“the First Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, whether RecordTV communicated
                        the MediaCorp shows to the public (“the Second Issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     third,
                        whether RecordTV authorised the Registered Users to do in Singapore any act
                        comprised in MediaCorp’s copyright in the MediaCorp shows (“the
                        Third Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     To summarise our rulings on the above issues
                    in advance of our analysis, we find, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    First Issue, that RecordTV did not copy the MediaCorp shows; instead, it was the
                    Registered Users requesting the recording of those shows using RecordTV’s
                    iDVR who did so. In respect of the Second Issue, we find that RecordTV did not
                    communicate the MediaCorp shows to the public because the Registered Users who
                    requested the recording of a particular MediaCorp show did not constitute
                    “the public” for the purposes of ss 83 and 84 of the
                    Copyright Act, and, in any event, the communication to them was not made by
                    RecordTV. Finally, we find on the Third Issue that RecordTV did not authorise
                    the Registered Users to do in Singapore any act comprised in MediaCorp’s
                    copyright in the MediaCorp shows. We shall elaborate on our reasons for making
                    each of these findings after analysing the Judge’s decision on the
                    aforesaid issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Issue: Did RecordTV copy the MediaCorp shows?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In respect of the First Issue (<em>viz</em>, whether RecordTV copied the MediaCorp shows), the
                    Judge found that RecordTV did not copy the MediaCorp shows within the meaning of
                    the phrase “make a copy” in the Copyright Act, and that it was the
                    Registered Users instead who copied the shows by their own actions in requesting
                    the recording of those shows using RecordTV’s iDVR. We agree with and
                    affirm the Judge’s finding that it was the Registered Users, and not
                    RecordTV, who copied the MediaCorp shows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In reaching the above-mentioned conclusion,
                    the Judge relied on the interpretational (and policy) approach of the US Court
                    of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>The Cartoon Network LP,
                        LLLP v CSC Holdings, Inc</em> 536 F 3d 121 (2nd Cir, 2008)
                        (“<em>Cartoon Network</em>”). At [22] of
                    the Judgment, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Cartoon Network, a three-judge panel of the US Court of
                        Appeals for the Second Circuit held that [the defendant]’s proposed
                        remote-storage digital video recording service (“RS-DVR”; this
                        being the category under which [RecordTV]’s iDVR is classified, as
                        opposed to set-top storage (“STS-DVR”)) did not directly
                        infringe the reproduction rights of those holding copyrights in the recorded
                        materials. In overturning the decision of the district judge below, the [US]
                        Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that (at 131–132):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… There are only two instances of volitional conduct in this
                            case: [the defendant]’s conduct in designing, housing, and
                            maintaining a system that exists only to produce a copy, and a
                            customer’s conduct in ordering that system to produce a copy of a
                            specific program. In the case of a VCR [video cassette recorder], it
                            seems clear – and we know of no case holding otherwise –
                            that the operator of the VCR, the person who actually presses the button
                            to make the recording, supplies the necessary element of volition, not
                            the person who manufactures, maintains, or, if distinct from the
                            operator, owns the machine. <em>We do not believe that an
                                RS-DVR customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a VCR user to
                                impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for
                                copies that are made automatically upon that customer’s
                                command</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>… In determining who actually
                                ‘makes’ a copy, a significant difference exists between
                                making a request to a human employee, who then volitionally operates
                                the copying system to make the copy, and issuing a command directly
                                to a system, which automatically obeys commands and engages in no
                                volitional conduct</em>. … Here, by selling access to a
                            system that automatically produces copies on command, [the defendant]
                            more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a
                            photocopier on his premises, and it seems incorrect to say, without
                            more, that such a proprietor ‘makes’ any copies when his
                            machines are actually operated by his customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… we do not think it sufficiently proximate to the copying to
                            displace the customer as the person who ‘makes’ the copies
                            when determining liability under the Copyright Act [17 USC (US)].
                            [The defendant], we note, also has subscribers who use home VCRs or DVRs
                            (like TiVo), and has significant control over the content recorded by
                            these customers. But this control is limited to the channels of
                            programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves.
                                <em>[The defendant] has no control over what programs
                                are made available on individual channels or when those programs
                                will air, if at all</em>. In this respect, [the defendant]
                            possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the
                            VOD [video-on-demand] context, where it actively selects and makes
                            available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing. For
                            these reasons, we are not inclined to say that [the defendant], rather
                            than the user, ‘does’ the copying produced by the RS-DVR
                            system. As a result, <em>we find that the district court
                                erred in concluding that [the defendant], rather than its RS-DVR
                                customers, makes the copies carried out by the RS-DVR
                                system</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In a nutshell, the court’s finding in
                        <em>Cartoon Network</em> that it was the customers of
                    the defendant (“Cablevision”), and not Cablevision itself, who
                    made the copies was premised on the concept of “volitional acts”.
                    There were two volitional acts in <em>Cartoon Network</em>.
                    The first was that of Cablevision in designing, housing and maintaining a
                    remote-storage digital video recorder (“RS-DVR”) system that
                    existed only to produce copies of specific programmes. The second volitional act
                    was that of Cablevision’s customers, who operated the RS-DVR system. The
                    US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that it was the customers who
                    made the copies because the process in dispute was no different from that
                    involved when a person used a video cassette recorder (“VCR”) to
                    copy a copyright-protected work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At [23] of the Judgment, the Judge summarised
                    the three factors considered by the court in <em>Cartoon
                        Network</em> in concluding that the bulk of the relevant volitional
                    conduct, “an important element of direct liability” (see <em>Cartoon Network</em> at 131), lay with the end-users
                        (<em>ie</em>, Cablevision’s customers) in that
                    case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    by analogy [with] the end-user of the ancient VCR,
                            the end-user of an RS-DVR is the main volitional agent in requesting for
                            certain programmes to be recorded;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    in relation to the end-user of an RS-DVR, who is
                            able to choose specific programmes to record, Cablevision is only able
                            to choose the channels of programming to be made available to a
                            customer; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    in determining who actually “makes”
                            a copy, a significant difference exists between making a request to a
                            human employee, who then volitionally operates the copying system to
                            make the copy, and issuing a command directly to a system, which
                            automatically obeys commands and engages in no volitional
                            conduct.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In relation to factor (c) of the above
                    quotation, the Judge departed from the view adopted by the court in <em>Cartoon Network</em>. He held that <em>no</em> difference existed between “making a request to a
                    human employee, who then volitionally operate[d] the copying system to make the
                    copy, and issuing a command directly to a system, which automatically obey[ed]
                    commands and engage[d] in no volitional conduct” (see sub-para (c)
                    of [23] of the Judgment). He also ruled in RecordTV’s favour on
                    factor (b) of the above quotation, and, <em>vis-à-vis</em> factor (a) thereof, he was particularly persuaded
                    by the analogy with “the end-user of the ancient VCR” (see
                    sub-para (a) of [23] of the Judgment). At [33] of the Judgment, he
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he end product we are concerned with here is a time-shifted
                        recording. If the end-user is the maker of this time-shifted recording for
                        the purposes of the VCR, it must remain that the end-user is the maker of
                        the recording in the context of the DVR, remote or local. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before this court, MediaCorp argued that the
                    analogy which the Judge drew with “the ancient VCR” (see
                    sub-para (a) of [23] of the Judgment) was flawed. We reject this argument
                    and affirm, on two grounds, the Judge’s conclusion that it was the
                    Registered Users requesting the recording of a particular MediaCorp show who
                    copied that MediaCorp show. First, we agree with the Judge that the iDVR is
                    simply a digital version of the traditional DVR/VCR. Its functionality is
                    essentially the same as that of the latter. Both are similar in the following
                    ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     it is the user who chooses which
                        show to record;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     the request to record a show is made to a recording device (the traditional
                        DVR/VCR) or recording system (the iDVR); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     it is the recording device/system which records
                        the selected show.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     No doubt, certain operational differences can
                    be discerned between the iDVR and the traditional DVR/VCR, <em>eg</em>: (a) the traditional DVR/VCR is located at the
                    user’s home, whereas the iDVR is located at the iDVR provider’s
                    premises; and (b) the vendor of the traditional DVR/VCR is unable to
                    control the use of the DVR/VCR as a recording machine once it has been sold to
                    the user, whereas the iDVR provider may stop the recording service as and when
                    it wishes. However, in our view, these differences are immaterial as they are no
                    more than variations of the same basic model of time-shifting. The fundamental
                    objective of time-shifting is to allow a show to be recorded on a storage medium
                    so that it may be viewed or listened to at the consumer’s convenience
                    after it is broadcast. This is a perfectly legitimate activity so long as it
                    does not constitute copying copyright-protected material or communicating such
                    material to the public contrary to copyright laws. We should add that in the
                    present case, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, the
                    Registered Users had to be legally entitled to view and record the MediaCorp
                    shows before they could avail themselves of RecordTV’s iDVR service to
                    record those shows; all that RecordTV did was merely to provide them with the
                    advantages and convenience of a time-shifting service, which MediaCorp itself
                    did not provide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Our second reason for affirming the
                    Judge’s decision on the First Issue (namely, that RecordTV did not copy
                    the MediaCorp shows) is that RecordTV’s iDVR not only serves the same
                    purpose as the traditional DVR/VCR (<em>viz</em>, to allow
                    time-shifting), but is also a significant technological improvement over the
                    latter with tangible benefits to users, in that RecordTV’s iDVR is more
                    convenient and user-friendly than the traditional DVR/VCR. Registered Users who
                    may legitimately view and record the MediaCorp shows no longer need to know the
                    start and end times of each MediaCorp show which they wish to record and the
                    channel on which that show will be aired because RecordTV’s iDVR has
                    already been programmed with the relevant information. These Registered Users
                    need only select from the iDVR’s electronic programme guide the MediaCorp
                    show which they wish to have recorded. Furthermore, they can even instruct
                    RecordTV’s iDVR to record all episodes of a particular MediaCorp show,
                    regardless of when and/or on which channel the various episodes are to be
                    broadcast.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Issue: Did RecordTV communicate the MediaCorp shows to the
                public?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We turn now to the Second Issue, <em>viz</em>, whether RecordTV communicated the MediaCorp shows
                    to the public. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above,
                    the Judge ruled in MediaCorp’s favour on this issue. With respect, we do
                    not agree with his ruling. In our view, RecordTV did not communicate the
                    MediaCorp shows to the public within the meaning of ss 83(<em>c</em>) and 84(1)(<em>d</em>) of the
                    Copyright Act for two reasons: first, we are of the view that there have not
                    been any communications to “the public”; and, second, we do not
                    think that RecordTV was the party which made the communications in question in
                    the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Communications to “the public”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     With regard to our first reason for departing
                    from the Judge’s decision on the Second Issue, the expression “the
                    public” is not defined in the Copyright Act, but, ordinarily, that word
                    connotes all members of the community or a section of the public. A substantial
                    number of persons can sometimes be “the public” in this sense. As
                    the learned authors of Kevin Garnett, Gillian Davies &amp; Gwilym Harbottle,
                        <em>Copinger and Skone James on Copyright</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2005) wrote at para 7-118:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the Act [ie, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
                        (c 48) (UK)] refers to the work being made available to “the
                        public”, in the usual way this does not mean that the restricted act
                        is only committed when the public at large can obtain access to it. Where
                        the work is only available to subscribers to an internet service, the
                        subscribers will qualify as “the public” for this purpose.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the present case, the Registered Users who
                    held valid television licences had an existing relationship with MediaCorp as
                    they were licensed by the latter to watch the MediaCorp shows (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). To the extent that there was a
                    contractual relationship between MediaCorp and those Registered Users arising
                    from the former licensing the latter to view the MediaCorp shows, those
                    Registered Users are arguably not members of “the public” for the
                    purposes of ss 83(<em>c</em>) and 84(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Copyright Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In any case, in view of the <em>modus operandi</em> of RecordTV’s iDVR service, we find that
                    any communications made by RecordTV to Registered Users who had requested the
                    recording of a particular MediaCorp show were made privately and individually.
                    We see no reason why the aggregate of the private and individual communications
                    made to each of the aforesaid Registered Users should transform the nature of
                    such communications into “public” communications. Although any
                    member of the public could register with RecordTV to become a Registered User,
                    he had no immediate access to all (or any) of the MediaCorp shows already
                    recorded by RecordTV. This was because RecordTV’s iDVR service was not a
                    video-on-demand service whereby RecordTV shared a library of recorded works with
                    Registered Users. Rather, a Registered User was only allowed to access and view
                    time-shifted recordings of the specific MediaCorp shows which he had requested
                    to be recorded. Thus, each Registered User had to make a request for a
                    particular MediaCorp show to be recorded for him, and only he could access the
                    show recorded at his request. According to the court-appointed expert, Assoc
                    Prof Roger Zimmermann:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Information about TV shows that are recorded on behalf of a [Registered]
                        [U]ser’s request is stored in [a] database table. Each record in the
                        [database] table is associated with one [Registered] [U]ser. When a TV show
                        is recorded into a file, the filename is also specific to the [Registered]
                        [U]ser in that it includes the user identification in its name. When a
                        [Registered] [U]ser logs into the RecordTV web site, the system will only
                        present the recorded shows of this user under [his] … [p]laylist and
                        therefore access is implicitly [granted] only to those shows. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Indeed, the Judge himself noted at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> of the Judgment that a particular time-shifted
                    recording of a MediaCorp show was made available for viewing to “the
                    member of the public <em>who requested the recording</em>
                    on the ‘My Playlist’ portion of [RecordTV’s] [w]ebsite”
                    [emphasis added]. Hence, the <em>only</em> recipient of
                    that time-shifted recording would be the Registered User who had requested the
                    making of that recording and who later operated RecordTV’s iDVR to play
                    back that recording to himself, and no other Registered User. In other words,
                    each transmission of a MediaCorp show recorded using RecordTV’s iDVR was
                    made to a single Registered User pursuant to his request. A Registered User did
                    not have access to all (or any) of the MediaCorp shows which had already been
                    recorded unless those shows were the subject of his prior <em>personal</em> recording requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Accordingly, the relevant question that ought
                    to have been posed was not whether RecordTV’s iDVR service was available
                    to “the public” as comprising any group of Registered Users (even
                    assuming (<em>cf</em> our view at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) that Registered Users who are legally entitled to
                    watch and record the MediaCorp shows can be regarded as “the
                    public” for this purpose), which was the question that the Judge appeared
                    to have asked himself when he said at [77] of the Judgment that “[i]t
                    should not matter that [RecordTV’s] service [was] available only to
                    [R]egistered … [U]sers, when <em>any member of the
                        public</em> with an Internet connection [could] register for
                    free” [emphasis in original]. Rather, the question should have been
                    whether a particular MediaCorp show had been transmitted to the public. Since
                    Registered Users could only view those MediaCorp shows which they had requested
                    to be recorded, those shows were communicated to the relevant Registered Users
                    privately and individually. The aggregate of private communications to each
                    Registered User is not, in this instance, a communication to the
                public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     MediaCorp argued that RecordTV’s iDVR
                    service allowed even a person who was not a Registered User (in essence, a
                    hacker) to view recorded MediaCorp shows so long as he knew the URLs (universal
                    resource locators) of the respective recorded shows. In this regard,
                    MediaCorp’s expert testified that no user names were appended to the
                    filenames of the files containing recorded MediaCorp shows. Rather, those
                    filenames were based on a numbering system which was not difficult to guess. A
                    person who guessed the filenames correctly would be able to bypass the
                    restrictions which RecordTV had put in place and thereby access recordings made
                    for other Registered Users.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We cannot accept this argument. In our view,
                    the average person would not, in all likelihood, know how RecordTV’s
                    naming convention for the files containing recorded MediaCorp shows worked. Such
                    knowledge would be, to use the Judge’s words at [98] of the Judgment,
                    “beyond the ken of all but the most determined and technically
                    gifted”. The susceptibility of RecordTV’s iDVR system to hackers
                    would only mean that where a hacker managed to successfully guess or work out
                    the filename of a file containing a recorded MediaCorp show, it would be the
                    hacker himself who made the show accessible to himself, rather than RecordTV
                    making the same accessible to him. We do not think RecordTV should be answerable
                    for every abuse of its iDVR service as it has an essentially legitimate purpose.
                    The nature of RecordTV’s iDVR service is such that it can be, and is
                    likely to have been, used significantly for legitimate, non-infringing purposes.
                    This is plainly not a case where the technology employed by RecordTV is
                        <em>bound to infringe</em> MediaCorp’s copyright
                    in the MediaCorp shows. Hackers can hardly qualify as “the public”
                    for the purposes of ss 83(<em>c</em>) and
                        84(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Copyright Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The communicator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We now turn to our second reason for
                    disagreeing with the Judge’s finding that RecordTV had communicated the
                    MediaCorp shows to the public – namely, we do not think RecordTV was the
                    communicator (<em>ie</em>, the party making the
                    communications) in the present case. We are of the view that the Judge’s
                    finding was based on an overly technical reading of s 16(6) of the
                    Copyright Act, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of this Act, a communication other than a broadcast is
                        taken to have been made by the person responsible for determining the
                        content of the communication at the time the communication is made.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In order to identify the communicator,
                    s 16(6) of the Copyright Act requires a determination of: (a) the time
                    of the communication (“limb (a) of s 16(6)”);
                    (b) the content of the communication at the time of communication
                    (“limb (b) of s 16(6)”); and (c) the identity of
                    the person responsible for determining that content (“limb (c) of
                    s 16(6)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Considering limb (a) of s 16(6)
                        (<em>viz</em>, the time of the communication) first,
                    the earliest time at which the recorded MediaCorp shows could be regarded as
                    being communicated would be the time when RecordTV’s iDVR placed
                    recordings of those shows on RecordTV’s Internet server and made them
                    accessible to those Registered Users who had requested the recording of those
                    shows. This follows from the definition of “communicate” in
                    s 7(1) of the Copyright Act, which includes the “making available
                    of” a work:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“communicate” means to transmit by electronic
                        means … a work or other subject-matter, … and

<p class="Judg-1">The definition of “communicate” in s 7(1) of the
                    Copyright Act is in substance the same as that in Art 8 of the World
                    Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty adopted in Geneva on
                    20 December 1996 (“the WIPO Copyright Treaty”). Indeed, the
                    latter definition of “communicate” (<em>ie</em>, the definition in Art 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty)
                    was implemented in our legislation via s 7(1) of the Copyright Act.
                    Article 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty provides for a right of
                    communication to the public which also includes, within that general right, the
                    right of “making available” to the public copyright-protected
                    works. That Article states, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]uthors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the
                        exclusive right of authorizing any communication to the public of their
                        works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the
                        public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access
                        these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Ordinarily, the word
                    “communicate” entails the communicator actively initiating an
                    instance of communication. However, by designating, as a form of communication,
                    the “making available” of a work in such a way that any person may
                    access the work from a place and time so chosen by him, s 7(1) of the
                    Copyright Act and Art 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty also regard
                    transmissions initiated by recipients (as opposed to communicators) as a form of
                    communication (see Susanna H S Leong &amp; Yuanyuan Chen, “The
                    Right of Communication in Singapore” (2010) 22 SAcLJ 602 at
                    pp 606–607). Under this latter mode of communication, a work is said
                    to be “made available” as soon as access to the work in question
                    is provided. <em>Hence, on the basis of s 7(1) of the
                        Copyright Act and Art 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, it would seem
                        that the recorded MediaCorp shows were communicated once they were made
                        available for viewing by the Registered Users who had requested the
                        recording of those shows</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Turning next to limb (b) of s 16(6)
                        (<em>viz</em>, “the content of the communication
                    at the time the communication is made”), we find that the relevant
                    content in the present case consisted of <em>specific MediaCorp
                        shows</em> that had been recorded pursuant to the specific requests of
                    a particular Registered User (these shows would subsequently be placed on
                    RecordTV’s Internet server and would appear on the playlist of that
                    Registered User’s account). The relevant “content of the
                    communication” was not RecordTV’s entire library or catalogue of
                    recorded MediaCorp shows, as a Registered User was allowed to watch only those
                    shows which he had requested to be recorded, and no other. If a Registered User
                    had not requested that a particular MediaCorp show be recorded, that show would
                    not be communicated to him. Indeed, if no request was made by any Registered
                    User for a particular MediaCorp show to be recorded, no copy of that show would
                    ever be made and, consequently, there would be no communication of that show to
                    any Registered User.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the light of our analysis as to how
                    limb (a) of s 16(6) and limb (b) of s 16(6) apply in the
                    present case, our ruling on how limb (c) of s 16(6) applies follows
                    naturally, namely: since the only MediaCorp shows that were
                    “communicated” were those shows that appeared on each Registered
                    User’s playlist, and since the exact make-up of each playlist depended on
                    the specific shows which the Registered User in question had requested to be
                    recorded, “the person responsible for determining the content of the
                    communication at the time the communication [was] made” would be that
                    Registered User himself. RecordTV would not have been the communicator of the
                    MediaCorp shows for the purposes of s 16(6) of the Copyright Act.
                    Accordingly, we do not accept MediaCorp’s argument on this point and
                    disagree with the Judge, who held that it was RecordTV which determined the
                    content of the communication at the time of the communication because:
                    (a) RecordTV pre-selected the channels whose programmes Registered Users
                    could request to be recorded; and (b) RecordTV’s iDVR system
                    determined the start and stop times of each recording, such that the Registered
                    User did no more than merely put in a request for a particular MediaCorp show to
                    be recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In holding RecordTV to be the communicator of
                    the MediaCorp shows for the purposes of s 16(6) of the Copyright Act, the
                    Judge was influenced by the consideration that if he held that it was the
                    Registered User who had control over the content of the communication because he
                    had control over which MediaCorp shows to record, “the maker of
                    unauthorised copies [would] <em>always</em> be the one to
                    communicate the same to the public” [emphasis in original] (see the
                    Judgment at [81]). The Judge’s full analysis of this point is set out in
                    the Judgment as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    Turning now to the
                            issue of who made the communication to the public, … [RecordTV]
                            claims that it is not the party that “communicates” the
                            work to the public within the meaning of s 16(6) of the Copyright
                            Act. Section 16(6) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">For the purposes of this Act, a communication other than a broadcast
                            is taken to have been made by the person responsible for determining the
                            content of the communication at the time the communication is
                            made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, since it is the end-user [ie, the Registered User who makes a
                        recording request] who has control over what programmes to record, it is
                        also the end-user who has control over the “content of the
                        communication at the time the communication is made”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    According to this
                            line of reasoning, the maker of unauthorised copies will always be the
                            one to communicate the same to the public (depending of course on
                            permitting facts). I am not convinced by this argument. To my mind,
                            there is an important distinction between the “making” and
                            [the] “transmission” of copyrighted material. This
                            distinction was noted by the US Solicitor General in her Amicus Curiae
                            Brief for … Cartoon Network … at p 20:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    The analogy between [Cablevision’s]
                                RS-DVR service and a set-top DVR is weakest with respect to the
                                public-performance issue because the operation of the former, unlike
                                the latter, would clearly involve a ‘transmission.’ ...
                                (To ‘transmit’ a performance or display is to
                                communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are
                                received beyond the place from which they are sent.) ... <em>Thus, even if the subscriber would ‘make’
                                    the copies used in the RS-DVR system, [Cablevision] might still
                                    violate the Copyright Act [17 USC (US)] if [it]
                                    ‘transmitted’ those copies ‘to the
                                    public’</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82    The key question is this: where exactly do the
                            end-user’s volition and control cease to operate? If we can say
                            that the end-user has made the infringing copy and transmitted the
                            infringing copy, there is little to prevent us from concluding that the
                            end-user is, in fact, an RS-DVR in disguise. For where, in that
                            analysis, would there be room for the implication of any properly
                            culpable technology? If the RecordTV system neither copies nor transmits
                            any material, how can it be said to have infringed any
                        copyright?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83    The line, therefore, has to be drawn somewhere, and
                            I think it sensible that it be drawn once the end-user has properly
                            exercised his volition in making a choice. In other words, while I
                            accept and have accepted that the end-user is the one who has control
                            over what programmes to record, the subsequent transmission of that
                            content would be effected by a process governed entirely by
                            [RecordTV].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84    Accordingly, I would read the words of s 16(6)
                            technically. The section is concerned, after all, with a technical
                            process. At the time the relevant communication is made, the end-user
                            has already communicated [his] preference to [RecordTV] (this
                            necessarily has to take place before any recording or transmission).
                            [RecordTV] therefore is the one responsible for determining the content
                            of the communication upon playback. One can easily envisage a situation
                            whereby, after the end-user makes his selection, playback is somehow
                            garbled due to a technical fault. It would be a stretch of the
                            imagination to say that the end-user was the one who
                            “determined” the content of the unintelligent static that
                            was recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    In the light of the above, I find [RecordTV] liable
                            for infringing [MediaCorp’s] copyright in communicating the
                            MediaCorp [shows] to the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We disagree with the Judge’s analysis
                    (as reproduced above) for three reasons. First, we are not here dealing with the
                    making of unauthorised copies of MediaCorp shows and the communication of the
                    same to the public. In the present case, all the copies of recorded MediaCorp
                    shows consisted of free-to-air broadcasts recorded for, transmitted to and
                    viewed by Registered Users who represented that they had the legal right to view
                    and record the MediaCorp shows (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above). The only thing that RecordTV did was to provide those Registered Users
                    with a facility to view the MediaCorp shows, which they were free to view at the
                    original broadcast time, at a later time. In using RecordTV’s iDVR to
                    time-shift in this manner, the Registered Users were doing no more than what
                    they could legally do when they used a traditional DVR/VCR to record the
                    MediaCorp shows (which were free-to-air broadcasts received via television
                    antennae) for their own subsequent viewing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Second, the argument made by the US
                    Solicitor-General in her <em>amicus curiae</em> brief for
                        <em>Cartoon Network</em> (referred to by the Judge at
                    [81] of the Judgment) is not relevant in the present context, not because there
                    is no distinction between the “making” and the
                    “transmitting” of a copyright-protected work (there is a
                    distinction, of course), but because the issue here is whether RecordTV
                    communicated the MediaCorp shows (by electronic means) <em>to the
                        public</em> (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above). The
                    Judge was unnecessarily vexed by the consideration that if RecordTV’s iDVR
                    system was not somehow held culpable for communicating the MediaCorp shows,
                    there would be “[no] room for the implication of any properly culpable
                    technology [under the Copyright Act]” (see the Judgment at [82]). With
                    respect, this consideration puts the cart before the horse as it assumes that
                    RecordTV’s iDVR system is illegal to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Third, it appears to us that the Judge’s
                    view that the volition of a Registered User ended once he made a request to
                    RecordTV’s iDVR system to make a recording (see the Judgment at
                    [82]–[83]) was unjustifiably influenced by situations involving recording
                    or transmission malfunctions. The Judge cited the example where a playback of a
                    recording was garbled due to a technical fault to illustrate his point that the
                    Registered User could not be said to have determined “the content of the
                    unintelligent static that was recorded” (see the Judgment at [84]). This
                    appears to us to be an extreme analogy and is not particularly helpful in
                    analysing the present issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In our view, where RecordTV’s iDVR
                    system operated normally as intended by RecordTV and the Registered Users, the
                    Registered User’s predetermined choices of the MediaCorp shows to be
                    recorded governed the content of the communication from the time that content
                    was made available all the way till the moment that content was received by that
                    same Registered User during playback. In situations involving recording or
                    transmission malfunction, we are of the opinion that the Registered User did
                    intend the same predetermined content to be communicated to him, but his
                    intention was frustrated by the malfunction. In such situations, the Registered
                    User could not be said to have “‘determined’ the content of
                    the unintelligent static that was recorded” (see the Judgment at [84])
                    because he could not have intended such static to be recorded. However, it also
                    cannot be said that RecordTV intended to transmit a garbled signal. After all,
                    the aim of RecordTV’s iDVR system was to allow the Registered Users to
                    watch at their convenience those MediaCorp shows which they had requested to be
                    recorded. Naturally, RecordTV’s intention in the ordinary course of events
                    would be to deliver to the Registered Users what they had requested for. The
                    fact that RecordTV’s iDVR system malfunctioned was not relevant to what a
                    Registered User had determined to be the content of his request. The same
                    reasoning can be applied to MediaCorp’s example of how a Registered User
                    who wanted to watch “Amazing Asia”
                    <em>only</em> might have to watch the end of the show
                    preceding “Amazing Asia” if RecordTV’s iDVR system did not
                    behave as it was intended to – MediaCorp contended that in such a
                    situation, the recording of the show preceding “Amazing Asia”
                    would have been made by RecordTV’s iDVR, and not by the Registered
                        User.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In our view, the better analysis
                    of this scenario is that it is a case of RecordTV’s iDVR failing to
                    deliver to the Registered User what he had requested for. Accordingly,
                    “the person responsible for determining the content of the communication
                    at the time the communication [was] made” (<em>per
                        s </em>16(6) of the Copyright Act) in the present case was the
                    Registered User who requested that a particular MediaCorp show be recorded, and
                    not RecordTV.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Third Issue: Did RecordTV authorise the doing in Singapore of any
                act comprised in MediaCorp’s copyright?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thus far, we have ruled that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>vis-à-vis</em> the First Issue, RecordTV did not copy the
                        MediaCorp shows; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Second Issue, RecordTV
                        did not communicate the MediaCorp shows to the public as:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the persons to whom the
                            MediaCorp shows were communicated, being limited to those Registered
                            Users who had requested the recording of the shows in question, did not
                            constitute “the public”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_42-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       RecordTV was not “the person
                            responsible for determining the content of the communication at the time
                            the communication [was] made” within the meaning of s 16(6)
                            of the Copyright Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We now turn to the Third
                    Issue, namely, whether RecordTV authorised “the doing in Singapore of
                    … any act comprised in the copyright [in the MediaCorp shows]”
                    (see s 103(1) of the Copyright Act). In the present case, the relevant
                    “act comprised in the copyright” would be the copying and/or the
                    communication to the public of the MediaCorp shows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The concept of authorisation liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The concept of authorisation liability in
                    s 103(1) extends the rights of copyright owners to cover acts of persons
                    which are related, in some way, to an infringement of copyright. In <em>Ong Seow Pheng and others v Lotus Development Corp and
                        another</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 113 (“<em>Ong Seow Pheng</em>”), this court held (at [27]) that the word
                    “authorise” meant to grant or purport to grant, whether expressly
                    or impliedly, to a third person the right to do the act complained of,
                    regardless of whether the intention was that the grantee should do the act on
                    his own account or only on account of the grantor. The court also said (which we
                    reaffirm) that authorisation could only emanate from someone having or
                    purporting to have authority to grant the right to do the act complained of; an
                    act was not authorised by a person who merely enabled, possibly assisted or even
                    encouraged another to do that act, but who did not actually have or who did not
                    purport to have any authority which he could grant to justify the doing of that
                    act (see <em>Ong Seow Pheng</em> at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Furthermore, in order for the authorisation of
                    the doing of an act to be a tort, the act authorised must be an act restricted
                    by the copyright. As Hoffmann LJ said at 660 of <em>ABKCO
                        Music &amp; Records Inc v Music Collection International Limited and
                        Another</em> [1995] RPC 657 (“<em>ABKCO</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true … that the doing of an act restricted by the copyright
                        and its authorisation are separate torts: see Ash v. Hutchinson and Co.
                        (Publishers) Ltd. [1936] Ch. 489. But there is an overlap in the ingredients
                        of the two torts in that “authorising” is a tort only if the
                        act authorised is an act restricted by the copyright. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>ABKCO</em>, Hoffmann LJ was referring
                    to s 16(2) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c 48) (UK)
                    (“the CDPA”), which states that “[c]opyright in a work is
                    infringed by a person who without the licence of the copyright owner does, or
                    authorises another to do, <em>any of the acts restricted by the
                        copyright</em>” [emphasis added]. Section 16(2) of the
                    CDPA is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 103(1) of the
                    Copyright Act, which likewise makes reference to the infringement of copyright
                    via the doing in Singapore, or the authorisation of the doing in Singapore, of
                        “<em>any act comprised in the
                    copyright</em>” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our reasons for ruling in favour of RecordTV on the Third
                Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the present case, as mentioned earlier
                    (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), only those Registered Users who were authorised by
                    MediaCorp to view the MediaCorp shows and record them for their own private
                    viewing (<em>ie</em>, only those Registered Users based in
                    Singapore who held valid television licences) were entitled to use
                    RecordTV’s iDVR to record the MediaCorp shows. All that RecordTV did was
                    to provide those Registered Users with a facility to time-shift their viewing of
                    the MediaCorp shows. RecordTV could not have granted any right to the Registered
                    Users to copy the MediaCorp shows and/or communicate them to the public as it
                    did not itself have the right to copy and/or communicate to the public those
                    shows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In our view, the burden is on the copyright
                    owner (<em>ie</em>, MediaCorp in the present instance) to
                    prove that RecordTV had authorised the Registered Users to infringe
                    MediaCorp’s copyright in the MediaCorp shows. In this regard, the Judge
                    was wrong in deciding that RecordTV had the burden of adducing evidence to show
                    that “the [Registered] [U]sers, without exception, were all entitled to
                    rely upon s 114 [<em>ie</em>, the defence of private
                    and domestic use]” (see the Judgment at [45]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Judge also held that RecordTV had
                    purported to authorise the copying of the MediaCorp shows because it had openly
                    stated, via a statement in the “Frequently Asked Questions”
                    section of its website, that it had “consulted with the Infocomm
                    Development Authority (IDA) and [MDA] and [had] accordingly obtained all
                    necessary licen[c]es from the Government of Singapore”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Judge interpreted this
                    statement as RecordTV representing that “it had the <em>actual</em> authority to provide its service to [the Registered]
                    [U]sers” [emphasis in original] (see the Judgment at [42]), and held that
                    “[t]o that end, [RecordTV] had purported to authorise the copies of the
                    MediaCorp [shows] that were subsequently made at the behest of [the Registered
                    Users]” (see likewise [42] of the Judgment). MediaCorp, unsurprisingly,
                    supported the Judge’s finding, and further contended that “the fact
                    that the [aforesaid] authority appear[ed] to come from the Government and not
                    [RecordTV] ma[de] [RecordTV’s] position <em>worse</em>, not better”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis in original].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We find the Judge’s and
                    MediaCorp’s position to be mistaken for two reasons. First, the reference
                    to RecordTV having obtained all the necessary licences from the Infocomm
                    Development Authority of Singapore (“IDA”) and MDA did not and
                    could not mean that RecordTV had obtained the requisite authority from MediaCorp
                    to authorise the copying and/or the communication to the public of the MediaCorp
                    shows. It was <em>MediaCorp’s</em> approval, not
                    IDA’s and/or MDA’s, which mattered, since copyright in the MediaCorp
                    shows vested in MediaCorp, and not IDA and/or MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Second, the statement by RecordTV that it had
                    obtained “all necessary licen[c]es”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> upon consultation with IDA and
                    MDA could not possibly mean that it had obtained the requisite authority from
                    MediaCorp to authorise the copying and/or the communication to the public of the
                    MediaCorp shows. In fact, RecordTV had warned the Registered Users that the
                    copying of certain shows might require permission and that it had no authority
                    to grant the same. This was made clear in cl 3A of the Terms of Use, where
                    RecordTV specifically stated that the Registered Users could use its iDVR
                    service to record only those shows/programmes which they would otherwise be able
                    to watch and record legally:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">RecordTV hereby grants you permission to use the Website [ie,
                        RecordTV’s website] as set forth in [these] Terms of Service, provided
                        that: … (ii) you shall not record any shows/programs on the
                        RecordTV.com website that you would otherwise not be able to legally see and
                        record on … another recording device, such as a personal video
                        recorder, digital video recorder, video cassette recorder etc. …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 3A of the Terms of Use shows that the right which RecordTV
                    granted to the Registered Users was limited to the right to use the iDVR for
                    non-infringing purposes. This clause would have come to the attention of all the
                    Registered Users as they had to view and accept the Terms of Use before access
                    to RecordTV’s iDVR was granted. Accordingly, we conclude that no
                    Registered User would reasonably deduce from the relevant portions of
                    RecordTV’s website, <em>viz</em>, the
                    “Frequently Asked Questions” section and the Terms of Use, that
                    RecordTV possessed or purported to possess authority to grant them the required
                    permission to copy and/or communicate to the public the MediaCorp
                shows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Further, we should add that there was also no
                    evidence that RecordTV granted or purported to grant the Registered Users the
                    right to copy and/or communicate to the public the MediaCorp shows. Upon
                    considering the four factors listed below (collectively, “the
                    authorisation liability factors”), which (in our view) the courts ought
                    to take into account in determining whether authorisation to do an act comprised
                    in the copyright has been granted illegitimately, we conclude that RecordTV did
                    not authorise the Registered Users to do any act comprised in MediaCorp’s
                    copyright in the MediaCorp shows. The authorisation liability factors are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the alleged authoriser had
                        control over the means by which copyright infringement was committed and,
                        hence, a power to prevent such infringement (“the first authorisation
                        liability factor”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     the nature of the relationship (if any) between the
                        alleged authoriser and the actual infringer (“the second
                        authorisation liability factor”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the alleged authoriser took reasonable
                        steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement (“the third
                        authorisation liability factor”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether the alleged authoriser had actual or
                        constructive knowledge of the occurrence of copyright infringement and/or
                        the likelihood of such infringement occurring (“the fourth
                        authorisation liability factor”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We should
                    emphasise that the courts evaluate the authorisation liability factors in their
                    totality in the context of the factual matrix of each case. Thus, proving one or
                    even several of these factors in either the alleged authoriser’s or the
                    copyright owner’s favour will not invariably be decisive on the question
                    of authorisation liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    first authorisation liability factor (namely, whether the alleged authoriser had
                    control over the means by which copyright infringement was committed and, hence,
                    a power to prevent such infringement), in <em>Ong Seow
                        Pheng</em>, the Court of Appeal found (at [33]–[35]) that even
                    though the first defendant might have facilitated or even incited the copying of
                    the plaintiffs’ computer manuals and programmes by (<em>inter alia</em>) a self-admitted dealer in pirated computer products,
                    this did not amount to “authorisation” of such copying as once the
                    defendants sold and delivered the infringing copies of the computer manuals and
                    programmes to the dealer, they had no control over what the dealer would do with
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The English and the Australian courts likewise
                    take into account the first authorisation liability factor in determining
                    whether the alleged authoriser ought to be held liable for illegitimately
                    authorising others to do acts restricted by the copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the Australian High Court case of <em>The University of New South Wales v Moorhouse and
                        another</em> (1975) 133 CLR 1 (“<em>Moorhouse</em>”), a graduate of the defendant university
                    (“the University”) used a photocopying machine in the
                    University’s library to make infringing copies of a book written by the
                    first plaintiff and published by the second plaintiff (the latter had the
                    exclusive right to print and sell that book in Australia). The plaintiffs sued
                    the University for copyright infringement, alleging (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) that it had authorised the copying of the aforesaid book
                    without their permission. Gibbs J expressly stated (at 12) that “[a]
                    person [could not] be said to authorize an infringement of copyright unless he
                    ha[d] some power to prevent it”. Following amendments to
                    Australia’s Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) in 2000, which amendments purportedly
                    codified the principles of authorisation already developed under Australian
                    common law, s 101(1A)(a) of the amended Act (“the Australian
                    Copyright Act”) now explicitly obliges the Australian courts to consider,
                    in relation to authorisation liability, “the extent (if any) of the
                    [alleged authoriser]’s power to prevent the doing of the act
                    concerned”. This obligation has been recognised more recently by
                    Cowdroy J in <em>Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited
                        (No 3)</em> [2010] FCA 24 (“<em>iiNet</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Turning to English law, the English cases of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, <em>CBS Inc and
                        Another v Ames Records &amp; Tapes Ltd</em> [1982] Ch 91,
                        <em>CBS Songs Ltd and Others v Amstrad Consumer Electronics
                        Plc and Another</em> [1988] AC 1013 (“<em>Amstrad</em>”) and, more recently, <em>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and others v Newzbin
                        Limited</em> [2010] EWHC 608 (Ch) (“<em>Newzbin</em>”) indicate that the English courts
                    similarly take into consideration the first authorisation liability factor when
                    deliberating on authorisation liability. For instance, in <em>Amstrad</em>, which concerned the manufacture, advertisement and sale
                    of twin-deck tape-recording machines that allowed users to copy the contents of
                    one tape directly onto another, Lord Templeman held that the first
                    defendant (“Amstrad”) had not authorised breaches of copyright
                    through its advertisement and sale of these tape-recording machines as,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, it had “no control over the
                    use of [its machines] once they [were] sold” (see <em>Amstrad</em> at 1054). The House of Lords held that without this
                    power to control how its tape-recording machines were used after they were sold,
                    Amstrad could not be held liable for authorising copyright infringement by
                    purchasers of those machines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Where the second authorisation liability
                    factor (<em>ie</em>, the nature of the relationship, if
                    any, between the alleged authoriser and the actual infringer) is concerned, the
                    courts will consider in particular whether there was a direct and continuing
                    relationship between the alleged authoriser and the actual infringer. The fact
                    that there exists a commercial aspect to this relationship (for example, the
                    alleged authoriser profits from the actual infringer’s infringing
                    activities) does not, however, have any definitive bearing on the issue of
                    authorisation liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As for the third authorisation liability
                    factor (<em>viz</em>, whether the alleged authoriser took
                    reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement), we find the
                    Australian cases instructive in this regard. In <em>Moorhouse</em>, the High Court of Australia ruled that the steps
                    taken by the University to prevent copyright infringement were not sufficient to
                    amount to “reasonable or effective precautions against an infringement of
                    copyright by the use of the [University’s] photocopying machines”
                    (at 17 <em>per</em> Gibbs J), and therefore held that
                    the University had failed to adopt “measures reasonably sufficient for
                    the purpose of preventing infringements taking place” (see <em>Moorhouse</em> at 17). In particular, Gibbs J considered
                    the failure of the University to place “adequate notice … on the
                    [photocopying] machines for the purpose of informing users that the machines
                    were not to be used in a manner that would constitute an infringement of
                    copyright” (see <em>Moorhouse</em> at 17) to be
                    “the fatal weakness in the case for the University” (see <em>Moorhouse</em> at 17).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     More recently, in <em>Cooper v
                        Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd</em> (2006) 237 ALR 714
                        (“<em>Cooper</em>”), an Australian case
                    concerning a website owned and operated by one Stephen Cooper
                    (“Cooper”) which allowed users to download infringing music
                    directly from other websites by clicking on hyperlinks provided on
                    Cooper’s website, Branson J considered s 101(1A)(c) of the
                    Australian Copyright Act, which required the court to take into account
                    “whether the [alleged authoriser] took any other reasonable steps to
                    prevent or avoid the doing of the [infringing] act, including whether the
                    [alleged authoriser] complied with any relevant industry codes of
                    practice”. Not only did Branson J find that Cooper had failed to
                    take reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement via the use of
                    his website, he also found that Cooper had in fact deliberately designed his
                    website to facilitate its use for copyright infringement, and that the
                    latter’s inclusion of various disclaimers was merely for cosmetic
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Similarly, the English courts consider whether
                    the alleged authoriser had taken reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright
                    infringement, even though English copyright legislation does not mandate such a
                    consideration. In <em>Newzbin</em>, Kitchin J said
                    that even though he was not bound to consider this factor, he was of the view
                    that <em>Cooper</em> and <em>iiNet</em> were consistent with the principles which he believed he
                    had to apply (see <em>Newzbin</em> at
                    [91]–[95]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the fourth authorisation liability
                    factor (<em>ie</em>, whether the alleged authoriser had
                    knowledge, actual or constructive, of the occurrence of copyright infringement
                    and/or the likelihood of such infringement occurring), we should emphasise that
                    the mere existence of such knowledge does not necessitate a finding that the
                    alleged authoriser is therefore liable. In the Australian case of <em>Nationwide News Pty Ltd and Others v Copyright Agency
                        Ltd</em> (1996) 136 ALR 273, for instance, Sackville J
                    (with whom Jenkinson and Burchett JJ agreed) astutely observed (at 295)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] person does not authorise an infringement merely because he
                        or she knows that another person might infringe the copyright and takes no
                        step to prevent the infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     We now apply each of the authorisation
                    liability factors to the facts of this case. With regard to the first
                    authorisation liability factor, it may be said that RecordTV did have the power
                    to prevent potential infringement of MediaCorp’s copyright in the
                    MediaCorp shows by shutting down its iDVR service altogether. However, it was
                    not necessary for RecordTV to take this drastic step as it had already expressly
                    stated in cl 3A of the Terms of Use that the Registered Users could use its
                    iDVR to record only those shows which they could otherwise legally view and
                    record. In using RecordTV’s iDVR to time-shift, the Registered Users were
                    doing no more than what they, as holders of valid television licences, could do
                    when they used a traditional DVR/VCR to record the MediaCorp shows (all of which
                    were free-to-air broadcasts) for viewing at a more convenient time. Not unlike a
                    VCR or a set-top DVR, RecordTV’s iDVR responds directly and
                    “automatically” to a Registered User’s commands without any
                    human intervention or decision-making by RecordTV’s
                employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In respect of the second authorisation
                    liability factor, RecordTV was at best a conduit enabling the Registered Users
                    to time-shift their viewing of the MediaCorp shows. It could be said that there
                    was a commercial relationship between RecordTV and the Registered Users, but, on
                    the evidence, RecordTV did not profit commercially from that relationship,
                    although the Registered Users did benefit socially. In any case, even if
                    RecordTV profited from providing its iDVR service, that was not wrong. There was
                    nothing to stop MediaCorp from providing an even better time-shifting
                    service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    third authorisation liability factor, we are of the view that RecordTV took
                    adequate steps to prevent infringement of MediaCorp’s copyright in the
                    MediaCorp shows for three reasons. First, RecordTV restricted the use of its
                    iDVR to personal, private and domestic use. This was made clear by cl 3A of
                    the Terms of Use, which (apart from stipulating that RecordTV’s iDVR could
                    be used to record only those shows that the Registered Users could otherwise
                    watch and record legally) stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">RecordTV hereby grants you permission to use the Website [ie,
                        RecordTV’s website] as set forth in [these] Terms of Service, provided
                        that: (i) your use of the Website as permitted is solely for your
                        personal, private and domestic use …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, RecordTV designed its iDVR service such that the recorded
                    MediaCorp shows were “streamed” to the Registered Users, rather
                    than “downloaded” onto their computers (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). This went some way towards preventing
                    illegal distribution of time-shifted recordings as the use of
                    “streaming” ensured that a recording of a MediaCorp show was not
                    saved in the Registered User’s computer, thereby restricting the
                    Registered User’s ability to extract, modify and exploit the recording for
                    further downstream transmission. As the Judge explained in the Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97    [RecordTV]’s system uses streaming as the
                            technique to disseminate the television programme data from the server.
                            With streaming, data is transferred from the server to the [Registered]
                            [U]ser, but upon arrival the data is displayed as soon as possible. Once
                            the data has been shown on the computer display, it is discarded. As a
                            result of this, no local copy of the recorded programme is kept or
                            created at the [Registered] [U]ser’s computer and patrons of
                            [RecordTV’s] [w]ebsite therefore have little or no ability to
                            store, edit or manipulate the recorded television programmes.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98    The average lay person is, therefore, unable to
                            extract recorded programmes … for further downstream
                            transmission. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Third, as we have already mentioned, RecordTV expressly stated in
                    cl 3A of the Terms of Use that its iDVR service could be used to record
                    only those shows which a Registered User could otherwise legally view and
                    record. In effect, this meant that only those Registered Users living in
                    Singapore who held valid television licences could use RecordTV’s iDVR to
                    record the MediaCorp shows (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Registered Users who were located out of jurisdiction were not permitted to use
                    RecordTV’s iDVR to record the MediaCorp shows as they could not legally
                    view and record those shows. Of course, Singapore-based Registered Users who did
                    not hold valid television licences could in practice use RecordTV’s iDVR
                    to record the MediaCorp shows, but such activity would fall foul of cl 3A
                    of the Terms of Use and thus would not be authorised by RecordTV where
                    authorisation liability is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     With regard to the fourth authorisation
                    liability factor (<em>viz</em>, whether RecordTV had
                    knowledge, actual or constructive, of the occurrence of copyright infringement
                    and/or the likelihood of such infringement occurring), the answer is, in our
                    view, clear. On this particular point, RecordTV had case law in its favour in
                    the form of the decision in <em>Cartoon Network</em>. Given
                    that RecordTV had expressly stated in cl 3A of the Terms of Use that the
                    Registered Users could use its iDVR service to record only those MediaCorp shows
                    which they could otherwise legally view and record, and given all the other
                    precautions which RecordTV had taken to prevent copyright infringement, it would
                    not be right to attribute knowledge of improper usage of the iDVR service to
                    RecordTV in the absence of express proof of such knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Accordingly, for the reasons set out at
                        <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>–<a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above, we find, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    Third Issue, that RecordTV is not liable under s 103(1) of the Copyright
                    Act for authorising the doing in Singapore of any act comprised in
                    MediaCorp’s copyright in the MediaCorp shows. In our view, where the
                    Copyright Act is unclear as to how much copyright protection ought to be granted
                    to a copyright owner, the courts should not be quick to construe a statutory
                    provision so liberally as to deter or restrict technological innovations by
                    preventing them from being applied in a manner which would benefit the public
                    without harming the rights of the copyright owner. In the present case, one
                    possible concern from MediaCorp’s point of view could be that
                    RecordTV’s iDVR system might be hacked into by persons who do not hold
                    valid television licences, thereby resulting in a loss of revenue for MediaCorp.
                    Of course, the possibility of hacking exists, but no evidence of the likelihood
                    of this possibility materialising was adduced before the court. In the
                    circumstances, RecordTV cannot be held responsible for this possibility. In our
                    view, the possibility of hacking is not a proper countervailing objection to the
                    use of RecordTV’s innovative recording system. After all, an ordinary
                    DVR/VCR can be abused in a much more serious manner than RecordTV’s iDVR
                        (<em>eg</em>, the former can be used to make hundreds
                    of pirated copies of a MediaCorp show for sale).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The provisions on safe harbour and fair dealing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As RecordTV is not liable to MediaCorp for
                    infringing the latter’s exclusive right to copy and/or communicate to the
                    public the MediaCorp shows and is also not liable for authorising the Registered
                    Users to do “any act comprised in [MediaCorp’s] copyright”
                    (see s 103(1) of the Copyright Act), it is not necessary for us to
                    determine whether RecordTV can rely on any of the safe harbour or fair dealing
                    provisions under Pt IXA and s 109 respectively of the Copyright Act.
                    Accordingly, we now turn to RecordTV’s claim against MediaCorp under
                    s 200(1) for making groundless threats to bring legal proceedings for
                    copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RecordTV’s claim against MediaCorp under s 200(1) of the
                Copyright Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Section 200(1) of the Copyright Act
                    provides that where a person threatens another person with a copyright

                        (<em>inter alia</em>) a declaration that the threat is
                    unjustifiable, unless the former satisfies the court that the alleged infringing
                    acts “constituted, or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of
                    copyright”. The full text of s 200(1) reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Having regard to our findings that RecordTV has not infringed
                    MediaCorp’s exclusive right to copy and/or communicate to the public the
                    MediaCorp shows and also has not authorised the Registered Users to do any of
                    these acts (which are acts comprised in MediaCorp’s copyright in the
                    MediaCorp shows), it must follow that MediaCorp has made groundless threats
                    against RecordTV for the purposes of s 200(1) of the Copyright
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the result, we find that MediaCorp’s
                    threats to bring an action for copyright infringement against RecordTV are
                    unjustifiable. Accordingly, the present appeal against the Judge’s
                    decision is allowed with costs here and below as well as the usual consequential
                    orders. RecordTV is entitled to damages against MediaCorp (which shall be
                    assessed by an assistant registrar), and an injunction restraining MediaCorp
                    from making further threats against it.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the present appeal requires us to balance the
                    competing interests of several stakeholders (<em>viz</em>,
                    consumers, content providers as well as technology and service vendors) in a
                    manner which would result in the most benefits to and impose the least costs on
                    society as a whole. It tests the boundaries of Singapore’s copyright laws
                    in protecting the exclusive rights of copyright owners to copy and/or
                    communicate to the public, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    cinematograph films, television broadcasts and sound broadcasts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Although copyright law is intended to promote
                    creativity and innovation by granting exclusive rights to copyright owners to
                    exploit their rights for a specific period of time, there is also a public
                    interest in not allowing copyright law to hinder creativity and innovation.
                    Rights conferred on copyright owners are statutory rights. In our view, where
                    the statute is not clear as to the ambit of an existing copyright owner’s
                    rights and the courts are asked to expand those rights so as to respond to novel
                    technologies impinging on the copyright owner’s interests, the courts must
                    strive to strike the right balance between the copyright owner’s private
                    rights and the public interest in the use of new technology. Thus, unless the
                    statutory words clearly reflect the legislative policy on the extent of the
                    rights to be conferred on the copyright owner, the courts should not be quick to
                    interpret the statutory words expansively if doing so may stifle technological
                    advances which are in the public’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In this connection, MediaCorp’s counsel
                    suggested that if RecordTV were not restrained from providing its iDVR service,
                    it could one day monetise its service once it had acquired the requisite
                    critical mass to sell advertisements. The suggestion is, therefore, that
                    RecordTV would then be able to profit from its iDVR service at the expense of
                    MediaCorp. This suggestion would be equally applicable to the use of traditional
                    VCRs, DVRs and variations of those devices, such as Cablevision’s RS-DVR
                    in <em>Cartoon Network</em>. In <em>Cartoon
                        Network</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that
                    the public interest in Cablevision’s innovative device prevailed over the
                    private interests of the copyright owners concerned. We are of the view that the
                    same position should be adopted in the present case because, through its iDVR
                    service, RecordTV provided a more convenient and/or more useful time-shifting
                    facility than the time-shifting services that are currently available. The fact
                    remains that so long as MediaCorp is prepared to broadcast the MediaCorp shows
                    on a free-to-air basis to members of the public (including Registered Users) who
                    hold valid television licences and who are thus legally entitled to view and
                    record the same for their own private and domestic use, it has already factored
                    in its alleged “loss” of revenue with respect to its copyright in
                    those shows. That RecordTV, by virtue of its improved time-shifting facility, is
                    able to exploit this relationship between MediaCorp and the aforesaid members of
                    the public does not make RecordTV’s actions unlawful or tortious under the
                    Copyright Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     To summarise our observations: in the present
                    case, RecordTV’s iDVR service represents a significant technological
                    improvement over existing recording methods and facilitates the more convenient
                    enjoyment of television viewing rights by those Registered Users living in
                    Singapore who hold valid television licences. RecordTV’s iDVR is simply a
                    technological advance that is not addressed by the Copyright Act in the context
                    of the copyright owner’s exclusive right to copy (<em>ie</em>, reproduce), communicate to the public and authorise the
                    copying and/or the communication to the public of copyright-protected material.
                    Since RecordTV was doing no more than making it more convenient for the
                    aforesaid Registered Users to enjoy the MediaCorp shows (which was something
                    that these Registered Users were entitled to do as MediaCorp had licensed them
                    to view those shows), we are of the view that the public interest is better
                    served by encouraging rather than stifling the use of RecordTV’s novel
                    technology, especially given that MediaCorp has apparently not suffered any loss
                    from RecordTV’s provision of an additional and better time-shifting
                    service to Registered Users who are licensed to view the MediaCorp
                shows.</p>
