<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff (the main contractor in a building
                    project) sought an injunction to restrain the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant (the employer in the building project) from calling on a Performance
                    Bond for the amount of S$360,084.62.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This Performance Bond was issued by the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having heard arguments by both parties, I
                    decided that the interim injunction granted earlier by Andrew Ang J should
                    stand, pending arbitration between the plaintiff and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. I now set out my

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff, as main contractor, entered into
                    a contract with the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, as developer, on
                    28 February 2008 (“<b>the

                    of Contract (as amended by the Additions to Conditions of Contract), the
                    plaintiff submitted Performance Bond No. SD08B04687 (“<b>the Performance Bond</b>”) to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant for the amount of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The architect under the Contract was M/s Ronny
                    Chin &amp; Associates of 147B Selegie Road, Singapore 188313 (“<b>the Architect</b>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The quantity surveyor was M/s 1MH &amp;

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 4 March 2011, the Architect issued the
                    Completion Certificate which certified that works under the Contract were
                    completed on 27 August 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Goh Tong Chuan (“<b>Goh</b>”), the Managing Director of the plaintiff,
                    stated in his affidavit that the plaintiff completed the works on 19 May
                    2010 even though the plaintiff was entitled to an extension of time till
                    27 October 2010 to complete the works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The director of the Architect, Chin Hong Onn,
                    also known as Ronny Chin (“<b>Chin</b>”),
                    stated in his affidavit that the original date for completion under the Contract
                    was 1 January 2010. The extended Completion date was 4 April 2010
                    after the Architect certified that the plaintiff was entitled to 93 days
                    extension of time by way of the Delay Certificate. As stated earlier (see
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>), the works under the Contract were
                    certified completed as at 27 August 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 30 March 2011, the Architect sent the
                    Completion Certificate to the parties by fax. The following day, the Architect
                    informed the parties by letter of the Completion Date of 27 August
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 24 May 2011, the plaintiff submitted
                    its request for an extension of time of 298 days. The granting of this extension
                    would bring the plaintiff’s work in line with the Completion Date of
                    27 August 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 22 June 2011, the Architect
                    recommended that an extension of time of 24 days be granted to the plaintiff and
                    this brought the total extension of time to 93 days.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In an email dated 24 June 2011, the
                    Architect sent the plaintiff a Delay Certificate dated 4 March 2011 which
                    confirmed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff was granted 93 days
                        extension of time,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     the revised completion date was to be 4 April 2010 based on the
                        93 days extension granted,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff was in delay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Goh, in his affidavit, stressed the point that
                    the Delay Certificate was issued only on 4 March 2011, some 6 months after
                    the certified completion of 27 August 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

                    37(1) of the Conditions of Contract, the plaintiff commenced arbitration
                    proceedings against the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant under the
                    Singapore Institute of Architects (“SIA”) Arbitration Rules by way
                    of a Request for Arbitration served on the 1<sup>st</sup>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     A determination by the Arbitrator that

                        Progress Claim No. 30 (Revision 4) and the said sum of S$1,197,669.68
                        is rightfully due and payable to the Plaintiff under the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 20 July 2011, the plaintiff sent the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s solicitors a list of
                    proposed arbitrators. Goh’s affidavit stated that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant completely disregarded the Request
                    for Arbitration and the system for dispute resolution and instead made an
                    unconscionable demand on the Performance Bond without any prior notice to the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    replied in its written submissions that this assertion was mischievous and
                    misleading, that the SIA Rules provided that a response was optional and that
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant did not need to file any
                        response.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 27 July 2011, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant made a demand for the amount of
                    S$360,084.62 under the Performance Bond shortly after being served with the
                    Request for Arbitration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 2 August 2011, the plaintiff obtained
                    an interim injunction restraining the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    from calling on the Performance Bond.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the light of Clause 2 of the Performance
                    Bond and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s demand, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant informed the plaintiff that unless
                    an injunction was obtained, payment would be made as demanded by 29 July
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Plaintiff’s progress claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 16 May 2011, the plaintiff submitted
                    Progress Claim No. 30 (Revision 4) pursuant to clause 31(2) (a) of the
                    Conditions of Contract for the amount of S$1,197,669.68, in respect of (i)
                    variation works carried out by the plaintiff after completion of the Contract
                    works under Architect’s Instructions No. 38-56, and (ii) variation
                    works carried out by the Plaintiff under several Variation Orders issued by the
                    Architect. In Goh’s affidavit, it stated that the 1st defendant and the
                    Architect did not dispute Progress Claim No. 30 (Revision 4) but they also
                    did not provide any payment response. On 14 June 2011, Progress Claim
                    No. 30 (Revision 4) was resubmitted by the plaintiff to the Architect and
                    the 1st defendant. According to Goh, this amount remains due and outstanding
                    from the 1st defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of Pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff submitted that the injunction

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,

                    that there was no conceivable loss on the part of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant that entitled it to make a demand

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     By a Delay Certificate dated
                        4 March 2011, the Architect certified that the plaintiff was granted a
                        total of 93 days extension of time under the Contract. The Completion Date
                        was then extended to 4 April 2010.</p>

                        completed on 27 August 2010. The plaintiff was therefore 145 days in
                            delay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to the provision on liquidated
                        damages for delay under the Contract, the 1<sup>st</sup>

                        S$870,000.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 22 July 2011, the quantity surveyor for the Contract advised the
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant that based on the draft final
                        accounts as of 8 July 2011, the value of works carried out by the
                        plaintiff that remained uncertified was S$29,782.90.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant also withheld S$480,132.48 as
                        retention money. Accordingly, the balance sum due to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant was (S$870,000.00- S$29,782.90
                        - S$480,132.48) = S$360,048.62</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     Accordingly, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        defendant’s case was that it was entitled to call on the Performance
                        Bond on 27 July 2011 for the sum of S$360,084.62, being a partial call
                        on the Bond’s full value of S$484,400.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was entitled to be paid
                        liquidated damages as compensation for its loss;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Architect’s replies to the
                        extension of time requests were based on the considered views of the
                        consultants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Allegations of conspiracy or interference regarding the Architect’s
                        certifications on the extensions of time were baseless;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     The extended completion date was
                        27 August 2010 and could not have been 19 May
                    2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        plaintiff’s delay in clearing Powergrid testing was not material in
                        considering whether the Performance Bond could be called
                    on;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_f"></a>(f)     There were
                        valid reasons for the time lapse in the issuance of the Completion
                        Certificate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Contract provided the date when the Delay Certificate was to be
                        issued;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_h"></a>(h)     The
                        plaintiff could not have implemented “catch up” measures after
                        receiving the Delay Certificate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_i"></a>(i)     Disputes over the plaintiff’s progress claims were
                        to be arbitrated and was not material in considering whether the Performance
                        Bond could be called on;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_j"></a>(j)     The Performance Bond could be called on even though
                        claims between parties were to be referred to
                    arbitration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_k"></a>(k)     There
                        was no need for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to respond to
                        the Request for Arbitration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_l"></a>(l)     There was no agreement between the
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the plaintiff to not call
                        on the Performance Bond if its validity was extended;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_m"></a>(m)     The 1<sup>st</sup>
                        defendant was entitled to the full sum claimed under the Performance
                        Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The main issue in the case was whether the
                    plaintiff had shown that there was unconscionable conduct on the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s part which would warrant a
                    restraint on the call on the Performance Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As can be seen from the facts, the parties
                    also raised a myriad of other matters during the hearing. Such matters included,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, disputes over extensions of time,
                    who was to blame for the delay in clearing Powergrid testing<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and
                    disputes over which party was liable to pay the other and how much each had to
                    pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In my opinion, these concerned run of the mill
                    construction disputes which were properly the subject of the arbitration. I held
                    that these issues were not for the determination of this court in an application
                    of this nature. Accordingly, I decided the case on the one issue which was
                    sufficient to dispose of the matter before me and I turn to address that
                    now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there unconscionable conduct on the part of the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant which required the call on the
                Performance Bond to be restrained by injunction?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The law as to when the court may restrain a
                    call on a performance bond was set out in the case of <em>JBE
                        Properties Pte Ltd v Gammon Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 47,
                    where the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is now well established that, under our law, apart
                            from fraud (which is the traditional ground for restraining a call on a
                            performance bond), unconscionability is a separate and independent
                            ground for the court to grant an interim injunction restraining a
                            beneficiary from making a call on a performance bond</em> (see,
                        inter alia, <em>Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd v AG</em>
                        [1995] 2 SLR(R) 262 at [53] and <em>GHL Pte Ltd v
                            Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                        3 SLR(R) 44 at [16] and
                            [20]; see also the GD at
                            [6]-[7]). This is wider than the English position, which
                        requires fraud to be clearly proved before a call on a performance bond can
                        be restrained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the recent case of <em>Astrata (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Tridex Technologies Pte Ltd</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 449, Philip Pillai J surveyed the leading cases on the law
                    on applications to restrain calls on performance bonds. The judge distilled the
                    following principles from the cases (at [73]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether there is unconscionability
                        depends on the facts of each case. There is no pre-determined
                        categorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     In determining whether a call on a bond is unconscionable, the entire
                        picture must be looked at, taking into account all the relevant
                        factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        concept of unconscionability involves unfairness, as distinct from
                        dishonesty or fraud, or conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in
                        good faith that a court of conscience would either restrain the party or
                        refuse to assist the party.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     While in every instance of unconscionability there would
                        be an element of unfairness, the reverse is not necessarily true. Unfairness
                            <em>per se</em> does not constitute
                        unconscionability.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)     In intervening in a call on an on-demand bond/guarantee, the court is
                        concerned with abusive calls on the bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a>(f)     Mere breaches of contract by the party in
                        question would not by themselves be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_g"></a>(g)     It is important that the courts guard
                        against unnecessarily interfering with contractual arrangements freely
                        entered into by the parties. The parties must abide by the deal they have
                        struck.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Ronny Chin, the director of the Architect,
                    took pains in his affidavit to state that “the Architect was not
                    influenced by or interfered with in its decisions on EOT, the Delay Certificate
                    and the Completion Certificate”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    “Architect’s decisions on time were all based on the
                    recommendations of the consultants in the Project”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     These statements arose because the Architect
                    had sent letters to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant seeking
                    “concurrence” on the Architect’s recommendation of
                    extensions of time. In his affidavit, Ronny Chin stated that it was his personal
                    style to use a softer approach rather than dictate his decision to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant and stated that upon hindsight,
                    this might not have been an appropriate phrase to use.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>Here it was evident
                    that the Architect was attempting to stave off allegations that the
                    Architect’s certificates were not issued in a <em>bona
                        fide</em> manner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, there was still no acceptable
                    explanation presented as to why the completion date appeared to have been
                    changed from 19 July 2010 to 4 April 2010. This, in essence, was a
                    backdating of the completion date. Counsel for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant, in the hearing before me, admitted
                    that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had no real answer on why the
                    date was changed. The materiality of the change in date was evident; the change
                    of date from 19 July to 4 April resulted in the plaintiff incurring
                    $700,000 worth of liquidated damages. This amount of liquidated damages formed
                    the substantial basis of a call on the Performance Bond. This exhibited a strong
                        <em>prima facie</em> case of unconscionability and I
                    was concerned that this was an abusive call on the bond. As I stated above (in
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>-<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), the cross allegations of breaches of contract fell to be
                    dealt with in the arbitration proceedings and so I did not consider them in
                    coming to the conclusion that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant acted
                    unconscionably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I also kept in mind the oft repeated warning
                    that the courts should guard against unnecessarily interfering with contractual
                    arrangements freely entered into by the parties: <em>Eltraco
                        International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 198, <em>Anwar </em><em>Siraj and anor v Teo Hee Lai Building Construction Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2003] 1 SLR(R) 394 at [16].
                    Having considered this, I was of the view that the parties did not enter into a
                    contract where the completion date could be, without good reason, unexpectedly
                    pushed back by the Architect after having been previously confirmed by
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Despite the other allusions to collusion
                    between the Architect and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, it was
                    the unexplained reference to 19 July as the practical completion date by
                    the Architect in the email and the subsequent use of 4 April as the
                    completion date that was decisive in my decision that the conduct of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant evidenced
                unconscionability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I therefore ordered the interim injunction to
                    stand. Costs fixed at $18,000 plus reasonable disbursements were awarded to the
                    plaintiff, such costs to be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant.</p>
