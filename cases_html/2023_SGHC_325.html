Straits Law asked for clarification on, among others, the nature of the payments; the reason they were made from a joint account of Roger, Eugene and Rachel and not KED’s bank account; the breakdown of the moneys that were derived from the wholly-owned subsidiaries of KED; and for supporting bank and financial statements. On 15 January 2018, Chan &amp; Goh LLP (“Chan &amp; Goh”) replied on behalf of Roger, Eugene and Rachel to state that the $15.5m paid to Cedric or Tony were distributions of the Family Funds and not dividends paid out from KED (“15/1/18 CG Letter”).

This was recounted by Victor in his “Untold Story”, a document he prepared in 2018 after the SA was signed, and which he shared with Tony, David, Roger and Cedric. In court, Victor admitted that he had added the words “payout to family members”, thereby indicating that “Santa Claus” (whom he acknowledged referred to Roger) was supposed to distribute the payout to family members.

This included paying for expenses relating to the Chng Companies, disbursing $900,000 to Margaret, and even paying allowances to Roger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I further find that when Michael passed on, Roger being the eldest son of the eldest Brother, stepped into his shoes. It is undisputed that Roger was managing the Family Funds in the Family Accounts even whilst Michael was alive and, after Michael’s passing, he continued to pay allowances regularly and almost every month to Victor (or Eugene) until August 2019.

This was despite being in possession of a document provided in discovery by Roger (the “Family Allowances”) before the preparation of his AEIC. Victor admitted to the accuracy of the Family Allowances in so far as they related to payments made to him. When queried, he reluctantly admitted they were also paid out from the profits and were essentially distributions, but claimed it was unnecessary to reveal these payments. Indeed, the Family Allowances (which Victor does not dispute) show Victor (and Michael) obtained far greater amounts than Tony or David. In particular, Victor received approximately $26m, while David received around $15.9m (which David accepts).

Then, on 10 January 2018, Lee asked Roger and Victor to review the draft letter and clarify if the Distributions to Tony and Cedric were goodwill gifts, payments made pursuant to a verbal agreement among the Brothers, or loans.

This document also does not support Victor’s case and was more consistent with David’s assertion that the arrangement was a “loose family understanding”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Purported Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The burden lies on Victor to prove his claim. Having considered the evidence, I find the Purported Agreement, as pleaded by Victor, did not exist. That being said, I accept the testimony of Roger (who admitted to the Hanoi Meeting) that the Brothers and Mdm Lim had discussed a potential payout of $1m to several members of the Chng clan and agreed on that issue. Tony stated that Michael had informed them that there would be a Distribution of $1m to each Brother and Mdm Lim. Hence, as Roger stated, a $1m Distribution was made on Michael’s instructions.

Regarding the requirement of certainty of intention, the relevant intention is that of the settlor of the trust. In determining if the settlor has evinced such an intention, the court will look at evidence not only of the settlor’s words and conduct, but also of the surrounding circumstances and the interpretation of any agreements that might have been entered into between the relevant parties: <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1097 at [53] and [58]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In this regard, even assuming that the settlors (of the alleged express trust in respect of the profits or Family Funds) were all the Brothers (as Roger conceded in court that the Family Funds belonged to the Brothers),

</div> there was no certainty of intention by all of them. Tony was unaware of any agreement or intention for all the profits or Family Funds to be distributed equally among the Brothers or that any terms akin to the Second Term to Fifth Term of the Purported Agreement were ever discussed. David claimed there was merely a loose family understanding. The subject matter of the trust was also unclear. Victor prevaricated between the profits from all the Chng Companies and the profits from only FHH. Pertinently, at the time the purported expression of trust was made in 2006, some of the Chng Companies did not exist and Victor stated there was no discussion pertaining to any company that might be incorporated in the future. Additionally, that the profits or Family Funds were utilized for other purposes and the Brothers never received equal shares of the moneys (and of which they knew) militate against the existence of an express trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 A common intention constructive trust arises where there is a common intention among the parties as to how their beneficial interests are to be held. The common intention between the parties may either be express or inferred, and there must be sufficient and compelling evidence of this common intention (see <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 at [83]). As I have found the Purported Agreement did not exist, and particularly there was no common intention among the Brothers for the profits or the Family Funds to be distributed equally to the Brothers (see also Tony’s testimony in this regard at [61] above), this claim thus fails. I am also unable to infer a common intention that the profits or Family Funds were held equally for the Brothers. The Brothers did not hold equal shares in all the Chng Companies (see [47] to [51]) and they received unequal distributions throughout the years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Next, a presumed resulting trust arises when there is a transfer of property for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [35]). I find Victor’s claim based on a presumed resulting trust also fails. If Victor alleges that the relevant trust property comprises the profits or Family Funds, <span class="font-italic">his</span> entitlement under a presumed resulting trust must flow from property which <span class="font-italic">belonged to him</span> that was transferred to the pool of the profits or Family Funds for no consideration. Victor has adduced no evidence to show to what extent the profits or Family Funds comprised property which <span class="font-italic">he</span> owned, such that a presumed resulting trust <span class="font-italic">over</span><span class="font-italic"> 25% </span>of the profits or Family Funds arose in his favour. I reiterate that the objective evidence showed that, at all material times, each Brother neither owned shares across <span class="font-italic">all </span>the Chng Companies, nor did they hold the shares <span class="font-italic">equally</span>. The profits and Family Funds were also expended to benefit persons other than the Brothers or their immediate families, and the distributions and allowances made to the Brothers were not equal. There is thus no discernible proportion of ownership of the profits or Family Funds that is attributable to each Brother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In relation to the analysis above, I add briefly that Victor’s reliance on any agreement (before the Hanoi Meeting) for his claims do not assist him. Although Victor claims that “from the very start”, there was an “informal or unspoken understanding” to share equally in the profits from the family business, in court he admitted that there was never such an understanding before 2006 or before the Hanoi Meeting.

Victor knew all these. For instance, cash from FHH (a key asset of the family business) was carried back from Hanoi to Singapore. The Fund Summaries showed Family Funds parked under accounts for “Fortuna City”, “FHH” and “KHM”. Further, in the 28/12/17 SL Letter (see [13] above), Cedric had pointed out that the $15.5m paid to him and Tony as “dividends” were not accounted for in KED’s audited financial statements. Mr Wee Phui Gam (“Wee”), the Brothers’ auditor for over 30 years and the auditor for various Chng Companies (save for the overseas entities), stated that dividends were never declared by the companies that he audited save for one instance.

Unlike the RA, the SA was drafted with inputs from two sets of lawyers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Chan &amp; Goh acting for Roger, Eugene and KED; and Straits Law acting for Tony and Cedric) and after a mediation before a lawyer at the Singapore Mediation Centre. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As for the RA, I accept Vincent’s testimony that whilst it would have been ideal to draft a proper restructuring agreement, there were constraints at the material time.

Eugene and David even claimed (through their lawyers, RS Wijaya) that the SA was void and that they would refuse to comply with it.

Thus, the document to give effect to this had to be drafted in a simple manner so that all relevant parties could understand, accept and agree to it with sufficient haste. Hence the RA comprised a one-page diagram (the Chart) to reflect how the 10 Companies would be divided up and the Waiver Letter, to achieve a clean break.

The transfer of KED completely to David and Eugene would require Cedric to give up his shares in KED, and this in turn required Roger to discharge the $49m payment to Cedric and Tony under the SA whilst also relinquishing his shares in KED to David and Eugene.

The $49m would have come from the Family Funds, as Cedric’s 25% share in KED would be transferred to Eugene and David and they did not have to personally pay any consideration for this transfer. Eugene (and Victor) knew at the material time that Roger had already paid Cedric the first $1m (pursuant to the SA) from the Family Funds (see [42] above), and Eugene and David did not care how Roger would fund the remainder $48m, although Roger would not receive any KED shares in return.

I give no weight to this letter, which was written more than 20 months after the RA was executed and a belated attempt by Victor to lay claim to further moneys from Roger pertaining to the Chng Companies even though he and David had parted ways with Michael’s side of the family. Victor’s belated attempt is clear from the timing of the events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 On 21 October 2019, David and Victor wrote to Roger to seek an account of the MGF Moneys and other moneys or the Family Funds that had been handled by Roger, and an explanation on various payments or fund transfers pertaining to FCPL. Roger informed them shortly after, on 1 November 2019 (see [21] above), that all matters relating to the Chng Companies had been settled by 18 February 2019, in view of the SA and RA, and there was thus no basis to dwell on past issues of these companies anymore (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Roger’s Assertion</span>”). At that time, Victor did not see it fit to rebut Roger’s Assertion. Instead, he merely sent a short email on 11 December 2019 to state that he would revert to Roger in February 2020 in view of the impending festive season and his long travel plans with David.

This would have included the MGF Moneys, which originated from the Family Funds via a transfer from the SC18 Account to MGF and which MGF should have repaid to the SC18 Account (see [20] above).

But the fact remains that the RA resulted in Victor and David obtaining a sizeable share of the Chng Companies with two main assets, namely FHS and the Hanoi Club. FHS was subsequently sold in April 2022 for nearly $86m, and Victor and David each received about $43m.
