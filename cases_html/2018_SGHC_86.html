In the OS, two sisters namely BLG and BLH (“the applicants”) applied to the State Courts for a declaration pursuant to s 20 of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MCA application”) that their sister BLK (“the third respondent”) was unable to make decisions for herself relating to her property and affairs, and to appoint the applicants as deputies to act in relation to the third respondent’s property and affairs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The MCA application was opposed by the third respondent well as by BLI (“the first respondent”) who is the third respondent’s younger daughter and by BLJ (“the second respondent”) who is the husband of the first respondent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Both parties were dissatisfied with the SAR’s taxation of the Amended Bill of Costs. Consequently, the applicants filed Summons No 3183 of 2017 for review of Sections 1 and 2 costs while the first two respondents filed Summons No 3184 of 2017 for review of Section 3 costs. Before both taxation reviews could take place, the applicants filed Summons No 5386 of 2017 (“the applicants’ summons”) on 22 November 2017 praying for the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That the [first and second respondents] do produce to the Honourable Court and the [applicants] a document (or documents, if such a single document is not available) setting out a breakdown of the total number of hours spent by each of their lawyers arising from or in connection with the following proceedings, or from which such breakdown of the total number of hours may be derived and/or calculated</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">in relation to the proceedings set out in [6(a) to (g)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The applicants’ summons was heard and dismissed by this court on 27 November 2017.

He informed the court that it was necessary and relevant for the taxation review(s) of the Amended Bill of Costs. In support of his arguments, Mr Eng cited O 59 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”) for the non-exhaustive factors the court must take into account in the multifactorial approach to be taken in taxation. He also relied on the Court of Appeal’s decisions in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Lim Eng Hock Peter</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1052 (“<span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1079 (“<span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> International</span>”) as well as the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Medical Council v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Mey Lee Susan</span> [2015] SGHC 129 (“<span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 To a further question from the court, Mr Eng clarified that he did not require to see the solicitors’ bill(s) of the first two respondents; he only wanted a breakdown of the hours their solicitors said they spent on the proceedings. Mr Eng complained that while the applicants had complied with the requisite Supreme Court Practice Directions (“the PD”) and filed a costs schedule before the Court of Appeal hearing, the first and second respondents had failed to do so in regard to the proceedings listed at [6] (save for CA 27/2014).  Consequently, the court did not have a comparative schedule of costs to assist in the taxation and/or review of the Amended Bill of Costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Counsel for the first two respondents (“Mr Poon”) in opposing the applicants’ summons pointed out that apart from the first two respondents’ solicitor-and-client bills, there were two other objective comparators the applicants had recourse to, namely Appendix G of O 59 and the costs schedule that the applicants’ solicitors had themselves filed for CA 27/2014.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Mr Poon pointed out that at the taxation below, the applicants initially gave no breakdown of the hours spent by the applicants’ solicitors or the tasks for the charges billed to enable the court to ascertain how the figure in the Amended Bill of Costs could have increased almost six-fold from the figure in their costs schedule. He submitted that the applicants’ summons was a strategy to distract from the key question at stake – why was there such a vast discrepancy between the figure the applicants informed the Court of Appeal was their costs ($606,000) and the figure finally presented in the Amended Bill of Costs ($3,530,226.65)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Mr Poon informed the court that the applicants had made the same request to the SAR pursuant to O 59 r 13(d) of the Rules of Court. The SAR declined to order the first two respondents’ solicitors to produce their solicitors-and-client bills.

</div> The SAR further declined the request of counsel for the applicants that the court draw an adverse inference against the first two respondents’ solicitors for refusing to produce their solicitor-and-client charges. As the applicants have not appealed against the SAR’s decision in this regard, Mr Poon cited O 59 r 35(1) of the Rules of Court (and the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lassiter Ann Masters v To Keng Lam</span><span class="font-italic"> (alias Toh Jeanette)</span> [2004] 2 SLR (R) 392) to support his contention that the applicants cannot now file the applicants’ summons to circumvent their omission to appeal.

I can do no better at this stage than to quote certain passages from the very case cited by the applicants namely <span class="font-italic">Li</span><span class="font-italic">kpin International</span>. There, the Court of Appeal exhorted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 As stated in paragraph 99B(1) of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (1 January 2013 release) (“PD”), solicitors making submissions on party-and-party costs or preparing their costs schedules may have regard to the costs guidelines set out in Appendix G of the PD (the “Costs Guidelines”). The Costs Guidelines serve only as a general guide and the precise amount to be awarded remains at the discretion of the court making the costs award.  Nonetheless, they are there for a purpose: to guide the court in making costs awards and therefore to guide counsel so that they may prepare costs schedules that are <span class="font-italic">genuine estimates</span> of their party-and-party costs and <span class="font-italic">defensible at the outset </span><span class="font-italic">without regard to the outcome of the appeal. </span>This requires counsel to, among other things, fairly assess their client’s case, the legal and factual complexity of the live issues, and the nature and complexity of the arguments that have to be canvassed and/or responded to and then in this light to consider the guidance provided in the Costs Guidelines. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 It has to be said that we think that the present appeal is a relatively simple matter; it is a case that essentially concerns the legal sustainability of an intended claim on the basis of certain asserted facts. In fact, we did not even require Mr Yim to rise in response to Mr Tan’s arguments. The entire substantive appeal was disposed of within an hour. We note also that the costs below were fixed by the Judge in the sum of $20,000. We therefore find ourselves in agreement with Mr Tan’s submission that having regard to the Costs Guidelines, even an award of $45,000 for costs would be generous.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 However, we also consider that the court may and often should take into account and assign the appropriate weight to the submissions of each of the parties on costs as part of the multi-factorial analysis that undergirds the exercise of its discretion in assessing and awarding costs. This, of course, is subject to its overriding duty to ensure that any costs order is not <span class="font-italic">unduly prejudicial</span> to the paying party. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 Given that the Appellant’s own claim for costs would have been on the high side (at $60,000) had it prevailed, we consider this to be a factor that should be taken into account in deciding the costs payable by it now that it has failed. We therefore fix costs at $50,000 all-in (inclusive of reasonable disbursements) and make the usual consequential orders.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 We wish to take this opportunity to remind counsel to take account of the guidance we have provided at [15] above. Counsel who submit costs schedules that are excessive and indefensible and reflect disregard for this guidance might find themselves open to sanctions including (without limitation) being made to bear the costs of any argument on costs personally. We have endeavoured to provide clarity and enhance consistency and predictability of costs awards through the publication of the Costs Guidelines and the imposition of the requirement for costs schedules to be submitted. It is now for counsel to help make these initiatives work as they should for the benefit of the litigating public.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in the original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In awarding costs of $50,000 to the successful party, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that even costs of $45,000 would have been generous. However, because the losing party put a figure of $60,000 into its costs schedule, the Court of Appeal gave a higher award of costs. Here, the shoe is on the other foot. The applicants’ costs schedule was reasonably moderate. But they now want to depart drastically from those figures.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The court is mindful that the costs dealt with by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Li</span><span class="font-italic">kpin International</span> was on a standard or party-and-party basis. The issue of indemnity costs, however, was the subject of appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei</span> following the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision to award such costs in <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei</span> [2010] 45 SLR 331 to the successful plaintiff in his defamation suit against the two defendants. The appellate court’s decision was given in 2011 before the costs scheduling provisions came into effect. It was there held that besides the considerations listed in para 1(2) of Appendix 1 to O 59, the principle of proportionality must also apply regardless of whether taxation is on a standard or indemnity basis. The Court of Appeal said at [56]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We think that costs that are plainly disproportionate to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the value of the claim cannot be said to have been reasonably incurred. Thus, in assessing whether costs incurred are reasonable, it needs to be shown that the costs incurred were not just reasonable and necessary for the disposal of the matter, but also, in the entire context of that matter, proportionately incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It seemed to this court (as to the court below) that the Amended Bill of Costs was out of all proportion to the work done by the applicants’ solicitors. This will be elaborated upon below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 At this juncture it would be appropriate to look at the guidelines in Appendix G of para 99B on Costs Guidelines. In Appendix G the following estimates were the party-and-party costs for:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contested Applications</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs ($)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(i)    less than 45 mins</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(ii)   45 mins or more</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(iii) Complex or lengthy application fixed for special hearing date (duration of 3 hours)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1,000 – 3,000</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2,000 – 6,000</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4,000 – 15,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Appeals before Judge in chambers</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">• 10,000 per day</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">• 15,000 per day (with Digital Transcription Service (“DTS”))</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Contentious originating summons before High Court </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">• With cross-examination: 15,000 per day</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">• With cross-examination (with DTS): 20,000 per day</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Appeals before Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Complex trials/OS: 60,000 – 100,000</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The above figures are to be contrasted with the applicants’ figures in the Amended Bill of Costs at [17]:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Summons 19006 – contesting the third respondent’s application to withdraw monies from her bank accounts </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$95,475.00 as against the guideline of $4,000 -$15,000.

Similarly, even if one applies the conventional uplift of one-third on party-and-party costs for indemnity costs (per the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei</span> at [83]), which uplift the applicants adopted in the court below), the excess is still high.

What was in issue before the court he said was the “magnitude of the discrepancy” between the applicants’ costs schedule and the Amended Bill of Costs. This court agrees.

</div> Tellingly, there was no affidavit before the court to explain what the “mistake” in the applicants’ costs schedule was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Before this court, Mr Eng was also unable to explain to any degree of conviction why his firm had departed so drastically from the costs schedule it had submitted to the appellate court before the hearing of CA 27/2014, albeit on a standard basis. Instead, he contended that a costs schedule was not the be all and end all in taxation. In answer to this submission, I refer again to the advice given to counsel by the Court of Appeal (at [15]) in <span class="font-italic">Li</span><span class="font-italic">kpin International</span> (<span class="font-italic">supra</span> [18]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Costs Guidelines] are there for a purpose: to guide the court in making costs awards and therefore to guide counsel so that they may prepare costs schedules that are <span class="font-italic">genuine estimates</span> of their party-and-party costs and <span class="font-italic">defensible at the outset </span><span class="font-italic">without regard to the outcome of the appeal. </span>This requires counsel to, among other things, fairly assess their client’s case, the legal and factual complexity of the live issues, and the nature and complexity of the arguments that have to be canvassed and/or responded to and then in this light to consider the guidance provided in the Costs Guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Surely some care must and should have been taken by the applicants’ solicitors in preparing their costs schedule. It cannot be that no consideration was given at all to the figures they put into the costs schedule or that no regard was paid to the guidelines set out in para 99B (see[16] above). It has to be borne in mind that the applicants well knew that their costs schedule would have an impact on them should they lose the appeal and be liable for costs to the respondents.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 None of the factors proffered to the court below on behalf of the applicants could excuse their drastic departure from their costs schedule. Indeed, for them to submit that the court should accept their excuses (not reasons) in [23] and allow the applicants to depart from their costs schedule would make a mockery of paras 99A and 99B of the PD and render them otiose. Equally, it meant that there is no distinction being made between the jurisdictional limits of the State Courts <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the High Court if there is no difference in costs structure between cases brought in the two courts (which counsel for the applicants sought to argue before the SAR). That cannot be right. Taking into account that the OS was commenced in the State Courts, a discount should have been applied to the Costs Guidance range of costs of $15,000–$20,000 (see Appendix G set out at [21] above) for contentious originating summons proceedings in the High Court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, the SAR (see [45] of his grounds of decision) gave the benefit of the doubt to the applicants pursuant to O 59 r 27(3) and did not apply any discount at all. Instead, the SAR accepted Mr Poon’s suggestion that a daily tariff of $20,000 for medical negligence trials was appropriate, taking into account that the hearing had a strong focus on expert medical evidence. In addition, the SAR gave an uplift of $3,000 to the daily tariff (at [51] of his decision) Using a multiplier of 30 for the number of trial days and the percentage tariffs to be applied for each hearing day set out in Part III(A)(i) of the Costs Guidelines for trials, he arrived at a figure of $485,000 (rounded up from $483,000) for the 30 days’ trial. The sum represented an uplift of 32.87% on the applicants’ figure of $365,000 in their costs schedule. This took into account the indemnity basis for the taxation. The allowed sum should be contrasted with the figure of $1,363,488.25 in the Amended Bill of Costs which is clearly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I had pointed out to Mr Eng at the hearing that if counsel for the applicants persisted in asking the same question 21 times of the third respondent within half an hour (as this court noted at [134] in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span>) the unnecessarily prolonged cross-examination would have been done at the expense of the first two respondents who now have to bear the charges.  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jian Wei</span> (at [69]) had cautioned against placing too emphasis on time-costing.  The fact that the applicants’ lead counsel may have spent 8 hours cross-examining the third respondent should not automatically translate into an 8 hour time charge.  Besides proportionality, the reasonableness principle applies to costs taxed on an indemnity basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Paragraph 99B(3) as set out at [16] above specifically states that solicitor-and-client costs do not come within the purview of the costs scheduling in the PD. That being the case, how can the applicants say that the bills rendered by the first and second respondents’ solicitors “may be relevant” (pursuant to O 24 r 1 and O 59 r 13(d) of the Rules of Court) for taxation/review of the Amended Bill of Costs?  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Finally, it would be setting a dangerous precedent to allow one firm of solicitors to see the solicitor-and-client charges/bills of another firm for obvious reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Consequently, for the reasons given by the court below in not ordering the first two respondents to produce their solicitors’ bills and by this court, I dismissed the Applicants’ summons.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Edmund Eng, Jamal Siddique Peer and Cheryl Chong (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the applicants;<br/>Kelvin Poon Kin Mun and Alyssa Leong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first and second respondents;<br/>Lee Hwee Yenn Amanda (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the third respondent.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
