<p align="justify">Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The original dispute was in

respect of the assets of the estate of Ong Seng King. The outstanding matter is the

inquiry to determine the estate in question and the second defendant’s share of the

estate. The inquiry was scheduled to commence on 21 October 2002 but in the meantime, the

parties filed eight summonses-in-chambers. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing all but one summonses-in-chamber:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) The first three applications for interim payments were dismissed

because until the inquiry is done, there was no basis to speculate as to how much money is

left in the estate. Moreover, it is a circuitous exercise to ask whether there is money in

the estate when the whole purpose of the inquiry is precisely to determine that very

point. Any claim must be made after the inquiry is concluded (see  2).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) In view of the refusal to allow interim payment, the fourth

application to stop any interim payment became redundant, save for the question of costs

which was reserved to the Registrar (see  3 and 7).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) The fifth application to discharge a Mareva injunction imposed

earlier by this court against the first defendant was dismissed as, on the little

evidence, there might be some not insubstantial sums of money in the estate in which the

first defendant had control over. A preservation order should be maintained, subject only

to any variation or other orders that the Registrar conducting the inquiry may make (see

 4).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4) The seventh application to set aside the Third Party Notice taken

out by the second defendant against the first defendant was allowed. The notice was

technically flawed in that it did not satisfy the requirements under O 16 of the Rules of

Court. Moreover, the inquiry could not be expanded to cover related but obviously

independent action that the second defendant might have against the first defendant.

Nothing can be more calamitous, legally and procedurally, than to encourage a writ action

within the narrow scope of an inquiry (see  5).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5) The eighth application taken out by the first defendant for an

order that the accountants for the main opposing camps exchange reports and for the

inquiry to be conducted by an arbitrator was dismissed as it had come too late. It would

only have the effect of delaying the hearing (see  6).</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        The original dispute in

respect of the assets of the estate of Ong Seng King, had been heard and judgment handed

down on 16 July 1996 by Justice Chao Hick Tin. The outstanding matter is the inquiry

ordered by Justice Chao, principally, to determine the assets of the estate in question

and the second defendant's share of the estate. The plaintiff's interest in the assets of

the estate hinges on the half share of the second defendant's entitlement of the estate

that was granted to her in the July 1996 judgment. The inquiry has been scheduled to

commence on 21 October 2002. In the meantime, parties filed eight summonses-in-chambers

before me. I dismissed all but one, and now give my grounds in one compendious judgment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        The first three

applications were for interim payments. Two were made by the second defendant (one as

trustee and administrator of the estate) and the third was by his former wife, the

plaintiff. The second defendant's application as a beneficiary was made on virtually the

same basis as that of the plaintiff. Both have set out the grounds as to why they need the

money. In the case of the plaintiff, the court had previously ordered interim payments

amounting to at least $3,000,000. She now wants another $1,200,000, mainly to enable her

to engage a senior counsel to assist her at the inquiry. She also wanted a sum of 5,000

a month to cover her living expenses. I accept that the assistance of senior counsel will

be helpful to the inquiry, apart from the assumed benefit to the plaintiff herself, and

also that she might well require funds, but that is not a sufficient ground in itself to

make an order for a further interim payment. The two applicants here submitted that

according to Price Waterhouse Coopers' Interim Report of 21 March 2000 there is a sum of

$12,477,556 due to the second defendant (of which the plaintiff would be entitled to

half). This report is being challenged by the first defendant. I note that some interim

payments have already been made to the plaintiff, but circumstances are different at this

moment. Until the inquiry is done I have no basis to speculate as to how much money is

left in the estate. Secondly, as the inquiry is due to commence soon, it is, therefore, a

circuitous exercise to ask whether there is money in the estate when the whole purpose of

the inquiry is, precisely, to determine that very point. So far as the second defendant's

application to be paid in his capacity as trustee of the estate, I am of the view that in

principle, he may be right, but under the present circumstances, he must make his claim

after the inquiry is concluded. The three applications for interim payments were therefore

disallowed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        The fourth application was

a joint application by the third and fourth defendants (the brothers of the second

defendant, and all three are sons of the first defendant) to stop any payment that might

be made to the plaintiff and second defendant. In view of my refusal to allow interim

payments, this application is redundant save for the question of costs, which I shall

revert shortly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The fifth application was

an application by the first defendant to discharge a <i>Mareva</i> injunction imposed by

this court on 22 February 2002 pursuant to an application by the second defendant. The

sixth application was by the third and fourth defendants to vary the<i> Mareva</i>

injunction granted by this court on 29 April 2002 also pursuant to an application by the

second defendant. The second injunction was granted to ensure that the first defendant

does not move assets belonging to the estate that may have been transferred from her

control to the third and fourth defendants, and thereby rendering the injunction against

her under the 22 February order ineffective. The history of this case, and I mean the

entire case from the first shot fired in the original Originating Summons up to the

present applications before me, the relationship of two main parties in opposition, namely

the plaintiff and the first defendant (the second defendant appears to have switched

alliance), have been acrimonious, and mutual suspicion continues to govern their every

conduct, each with the other. On the little evidence (by way of affidavits) before me, I

can only conclude that there may be some not insubstantial (but undefined) sums of money

(or assets with value) in the estate and in which the first defendant has control over. If

that is correct, then given the present situation, I am of the view that a preservation

order should be maintained, subject only to any variation or other orders that the

Registrar conducting the inquiry (and the parties may be reminded that the inquiry is less

than 30 days away), may make. For these reasons, the applications to discharge or vary the

<i>Mareva</i> injunctions were dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The seventh application

was an application to set aside the Third Party Notice taken out by the second defendant

against the first defendant. Technically, the Third Party Notice is flawed in that it does

not satisfy the requirements under O 16 of the Rules of Court, and no directions have been

taken out by the second defendant so far that may identify the precise nature and purpose

of that application. Nonetheless, it must not be forgotten that the scheduled inquiry as

ordered, and the terms of the inquiry, cannot be expanded to cover related but obviously

independent action that the second defendant might have against the first defendant or any

other party. The inquiry is specifically to ascertain the size and value of the estate,

and the share that the second defendant may be entitled. The inquiry is not the forum for

any action concerning a breach of trust, a wrongful failure to administer the estate, or

the wrongful use of estate funds. What is left under the present Originating Summons, as I

have recited <i>ad nauseam </i>is to inquire into the assets of the estate. My point is

reinforced by the expression of intent by Mr. Arul to join the fourth defendant as the

second Third Party. Nothing can be more calamitous, legally and procedurally, than to

encourage a writ action within the narrow scope of an inquiry. The application to set

aside the Third Party Notice was therefore allowed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        The eighth application was

taken out by the first defendant for an order that Arthur Anderson and Price Waterhouse

Coopers (the accountancy experts for the main opposing camps respectively) exchange their

reports and for the inquiry to be conducted by an arbitrator. The first part of this

application is superficially attractive, but it seems to me to have come too late. An

exchange of reports at this stage, given the history of this case, is likely to spawn

further applications such as may stymie the inquiry. The parties must stand by its

respective reports and, if any further directions are required, to be issued by the

Registrar conducting the inquiry. The second part of this application also appears

attractive. I am of the view, however, that a direction for the inquiry to be conducted by

an arbitrator at this stage will similarly delay the hearing; so that call has also come a

little late, but nonetheless, the parties may still, by consent, proceed to arbitration on

their own accord even though realistically, the prospect of that is dismally dim. </p>
