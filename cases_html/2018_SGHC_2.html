</div> I shall return to the FAS below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The WICA framework: Rationale, key definitions and procedures</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rationale</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 This can be dealt with briefly as the general points are well-known and summarised in <span class="font-italic">Kee Yau Chong v S</span><span class="font-italic"> H Interdeco Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 189. A few points will suffice. The long title of the statute states that the WICA is “[a]n Act relating to the payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their employment.” The WICA has a long history. It has been amended numerous times and dates back to the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Act 25 of 1975) and beyond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the second reading of the Work Injury Compensation (Amendment) Bill 2011 (Bill 18 of 2011) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (21 November 2011) vol 88), acting Minister of Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin explained the Government’s thinking behind the WICA and the 2011 amendments thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he Work Injury Compensation Act … is a piece of social legislation that aims to provide low-cost and expeditious resolution of work-related injury claims … In 2010, a total of $76.5 million in compensation was awarded for permanent incapacity and death. On top of that, an estimated $20 million was paid out by employers and insurers for medical leave wages and medical expenses for both minor and serious injuries ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The changes proposed in the Bill are based on two key principles. The first is to strike a fair balance between compensation for the injured worker and obligations placed on the employer or insurer. The second is to ensure that the WICA framework remains expeditious and workers are able to receive compensation promptly. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Balancing the interests of the injured worker and the employer or insurer is critical because WICA is a no-fault regime, similar to other WICA regimes overseas. This means that injured workers will receive compensation as long as the accident occurred out of and in the course of work, regardless of which party was at fault. Therefore, the obligations placed on the employers and insurers in areas such as compensation and liability must necessarily be limited. Injured workers who feel they deserve higher compensation, do have the option to file a civil claim, if they can prove negligence of the party they are claiming against.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I pause to stress that whilst the WICA speaks of “compensation to employees” and advances the goal of “[b]alancing the interests of the injured worker and the employer or insurer”, the WICA regime also speaks to the interests of dependants of a deceased worker who as a result of the accident and death of the worker find that they have lost their source of income and financial support.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As will be discussed in more detail below, dependency claims are separate and distinct from claims on behalf of the estate of the deceased worker. The point I make at the outset is that the statement by the acting Minister of Manpower that one objective of the 2011 amendments was “to ensure that the WICA framework remains expeditious and workers are able to receive compensation promptly” applies equally to dependency claims. Indeed, the Explanatory Statement to the Workmen’s Compensation Bill 1975 (Bill 5 of 1975)<span class="font-italic"> </span>stated that one objective behind the repeal and re-enactment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act was to “provide for more effective enforcement and administration and for swifter remedies”. The Explanatory Statement also noted that the changes made by the 1975 Bill included an amendment to the definition of “dependant” “so that a person who falls within one of the specified categories of relatives will not have to prove actual dependency in order to obtain compensation where a workman has been involved in a fatal accident.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The WICA does not replace or remove any common law right of action. Instead, the goal of the WICA is to set up a statutory scheme linked with insurance to provide quick means for compensation. In broad terms, two main goals (leaving aside for the moment any interplay between the goals) are to provide quick basic no-fault compensation for:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) employees injured by accidents during or arising in employment, where the compensation is for the employee (and his estate if relevant); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) dependants for loss of dependency.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Key definitions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Section 2 of the WICA defines “dependant”, in respect of a deceased employee, as meaning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the wife, husband, parent, grandparent, step-father, step-mother, child, grandchild, step-child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, step-brother and step-sister irrespective of whether that person is actually dependent on the employee’s earnings or not and for the purpose of this definition —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the child of a deceased employee shall be deemed to include the illegitimate child of that employee and any child whose adoption by him has been registered under the Adoption of Children Act (Cap. 4); and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the parent of a deceased employee shall be deemed to include the father and the mother of an illegitimate child and the person who has registered the adoption of any child under the Adoption of Children Act …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Section 2(3) provides that “[a]ny reference to an employee who has been injured shall, unless the context otherwise requires, where the employee is dead, include a reference to his legal personal representative or to his dependants or any of them.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is noted that there is no requirement for a dependant to prove “actual dependency”. Further, it bears underscoring that the definition of “dependant” is not the same as the definition of “next of kin” in terms of the persons entitled to claim against the estate of a deceased person on intestacy. For example, an illegitimate child is not entitled to a claim against the estate on intestacy (see Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed), ss 6 and 7; <span class="font-italic">AAG v Estate of AAH, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 769 at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Liability for compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Part II of the WICA deals with compensation for injury.

Notice to the employer is not however required where a fatal accident has occurred.

One issue was whether damages could be given for the loss of earnings across all the years of life which the victim would have had if he had not met with the accident. It was in this context that observations were made on a lost-years claim by a living plaintiff, a deceased plaintiff’s estate, and a dependency claim (see [194], [201], [248], [260] and [261]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">AOD </span>noted at [181] and [185] that the common law rule that no action could be brought for loss suffered through the killing of another was changed by Parliament through s 10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”). After the victim dies, the cause of action survives for the benefit of the deceased’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Lord Scarman in <span class="font-italic">Pickett</span><span class="font-italic"> (Administratrix of the Estate of Ralph Henry Pickett Deceased) v British Rail Engineering Ltd</span> [1978] 3 WLR 955 at 981E recognised that the question as to who are the parties that have suffered loss and ought to be compensated is not an easy one to answer. The deceased victim (as represented by his estate) has of course suffered loss. At the same time, the dependants of the deceased victim have also suffered loss: the financial support of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">AOD</span>, the court observed at [179]–[182] that three distinct types of claims have developed in English and Singapore law:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a <span class="font-italic">living plaintiff’s claim</span> for loss of income during the lost years;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an <span class="font-italic">estate claim</span> under s 10 of the CLA for a deceased plaintiff’s loss of income during the lost years; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a <span class="font-italic">claim by the dependants</span> for the loss of the value of their dependency under s 20 of the CLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">AOD</span> was in fact concerned with the first type of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Turning to a claim for loss of dependency following death, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">AOD</span> at [184] noted Woo Bih Li J’s observation in  <span class="font-italic">Lassiter Ann Masters (suing as the widow and dependant of Lassiter Henry Adolphus, deceased) v </span><span class="font-italic">To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 8 at [12]–[29] that Singapore’s law on fatal accidents and claims for loss of income was originally based on the common law principle that a personal action dies with the person. Because of the injustice that dependants were thought to suffer from losing their sole breadwinner in an accident caused by a defendant’s negligence, the United Kingdom (“the UK”) passed the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 (c 93) (UK) which enabled prescribed classes of dependants to bring an action for loss of dependency against a tortfeasor who caused the death of their relatives (now see s 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (c 30) (UK)). The equivalent provision in Singapore is s 20 of the CLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The question naturally arose as to the relationship between the estate claim (s 10 of the CLA) and the dependency claim (s 20 of the CLA). As discussed in <span class="font-italic">AOD</span> at [189], the courts were soon concerned with the potential unfairness to a defendant arising from the possibility of double recovery by the estate and by the dependants under statute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the possibility that an estate claim and a dependant’s claim could both succeed simultaneously, resulting in the defendant having to pay damages twice for the same loss caused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54  The UK Parliament eventually intervened by passing the Administration of Justice Act 1982 (c 53) (UK). The Act amended the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (c 41) (UK) (“the 1934 LRA”) by adding that an estate <span class="font-italic">does not</span> inherit actions for “damages for loss of income in respect of any period after that person’s death”. This essentially precluded an estate from bringing a lost-years claim after the plaintiff’s death. Singapore followed suit in 1987; the same amendment (<span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span>) can be found at s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The key point is that there is now no potential overlap anymore between the estate claim and dependency claim in respect of the deceased’s lost earnings post-death. Even though the dependency claim under s 20 of the CLA is usually mounted by the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased, the dependency claim is on behalf of and for the benefit of the dependants. Whilst s 10(5) of the CLA states that the rights conferred for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any rights conferred on the dependants of deceased persons by s 20, an estate claim cannot be brought for loss of income after death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This is the backdrop against which the WICA and claims by dependants must be viewed. Indeed, it bears repeating that the beneficiaries of an estate claim (next of kin) are not necessarily the same persons as the dependants who are entitled in respect of a dependency claim. For example, while an illegitimate child is not entitled to claim on intestacy, he is treated as a dependant under the WICA even though he is not a beneficiary of the estate of the deceased (see [22] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dependency claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Section 20 of the CLA deals with the right of action for wrongful acts causing death.

A Committee of Persons (“COP”) was appointed to represent the victim and to manage his affairs. A suit for negligence was commenced in the Subordinate Courts (now the State Courts). A consent interlocutory judgment on liability was entered. During the assessment of damages hearing, an open offer of settlement at $500,000 was made. A counter-offer was made by the victim through the COP to settle at $850,000. The victim subsequently passed away before damages was assessed. The deceased’s mother obtained an order of court so as to be made a party to the proceedings as the legal representative of the deceased. Thereafter, the offer to settle at $500,000 was purportedly accepted. A dispute then arose as to whether the respondent was entitled to accept the offer to settle at $500,000, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, because letters of administration had not been obtained at the time the offer was accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Chao Hick Tin JA, delivering the grounds of decision of the Court of Appeal, started with the observation at [14] that following the death of the victim, the action was being pursued as the estate’s claim for damages under a cause of action that survived death under s 10 of the CLA. The court was not concerned with a dependency claim under s 20 of the CLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Court of Appeal noted at [16] that if the victim had already died and the action had been commenced by a person without letters of administration, the action would clearly have been a nullity. The position would have been different if the victim had left a will with a named executor, since executorship takes effect from death. There would have been no need for probate before the executor could apply to be substituted in place of the deceased in the action (at [21]).  After reviewing prior case law, the Court of Appeal remarked at [31] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In cases of intestacy, the court jealously guards the assets – including causes of action – of the deceased’s estate through the procedure by which letters of administration are granted. If this is the position where the writ has not yet been filed, there seems no good reason why this protection should be lifted where the writ has already been commenced but the plaintiff dies intestate before it has been finally determined. The underlying public interest – the preservation of the assets of the estate – is the same and the estate’s worth may be frittered away as much through the process of litigation as by the commencement of an action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69  The Court of Appeal found at [19] that the respondent was not properly authorised to act for the estate since it was clear that she had not been granted letters of administration. It followed that all subsequent acts taken on behalf of deceased’s estate were nullities, including, in particular, her purported acceptance of the offer to settle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The short response to the applicants’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Maran</span>’s case, however, is that the Court of Appeal was not concerned with a claim by dependants under the WICA. <span class="font-italic">Maran</span>’s case involved a claim brought by the injured victim for and on his own behalf. At the time when the negligence suit was brought, he was alive albeit in a vegetative state. Nevertheless, the negligence suit had properly been instituted by the COP appointed to act on his behalf. The problem was that on his death, the negligence action for damages was pursued as the estate’s claim under a cause of action that survived death (see s 10(1) of the CLA). It was not a dependency claim mounted under s 20 of the CLA by a dependant of a deceased person.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicability of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Starkstrom</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The second case relied on by the applicants is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom</span>. In this case, Tan Yun Yeow (“TYY”) was employed by the appellant. Following a workplace accident, he suffered serious injuries and became mentally incapacitated as a result. His brother, Rodney Tan (“Rodney”), was eventually appointed as his deputy under the MCA. Prior to his appointment as a deputy, Rodney purported to make a claim on behalf of his brother TYY under the WICA. On appeal, the primary question raised was whether Rodney had the capacity, prior to being appointed as a deputy under the MCA, to make an election on behalf of the Injured Employee to seek relief under the WICA (at [3]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Sundaresh Menon CJ, delivering the grounds of decision of the Court of Appeal, started with the useful observation at [1] that “[t]he WICA establishes a statutory compensation scheme that is available to employees who suffer injuries in the course of employment” and that the scheme “generally offers a lower cost alternative to pursuing a common law claim for damages arising from workplace negligence.”  The heads of damages that may be recovered were however “constrained by the terms of the WICA”, and “[a]n employee who elects to pursue his claim under the WICA will also forgo his rights at common law.” It followed that the filing of the disputed claim had important potential consequences for the injured employee TYY.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom</span>, the Commissioner had initially accepted the disputed claim, and issued a Notice of Assessment to both the appellant and Rodney. Having received the Notice of Assessment, Rodney changed his mind and maintained that he wished and was entitled to pursue TYY’s claims at common law. The Commissioner did not agree with this initially, but changed her position upon receiving advice from the Attorney-General’s Chambers. She informed the appellant that the disputed claim was invalid on the basis that Rodney did not have the authority at the material time to make a valid election on behalf of TYY to pursue his remedies under the WICA instead of under the common law (at [2]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Thereafter, the appellant commenced judicial review proceedings. In the meantime, common law proceedings were commenced by Rodney as deputy of the TYY against the appellant and other parties. The appellant applied to strike out the writ and the statement of claim on the basis of s 33(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA, which states that an action for damages is not maintainable if the employee “has a claim for compensation for that injury under the provisions of this Act and does not withdraw his claim within a period of 28 days after the service of the notice of assessment of compensation in respect of that claim” (at [14]–[15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75  Before the High Court, the only issue canvassed was whether a mentally incapacitated employee's next of kin who had not been appointed a deputy under the MCA could nonetheless elect on behalf of that employee to pursue his remedies under the WICA. This would determine whether the disputed claim was valid and that in turn could affect TYY’s common law claim for damages given the effect of s 33(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Court of Appeal started at [22] with the well-established principle that one has no power to make decisions or to act on behalf of a mentally incapacitated person unless properly authorised to do so. In general, being the next of kin or a close relation of a mentally incapacitated person does not, without more, confer legal capacity to act on behalf of the latter; such authorisation must be conferred by law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The decision to claim compensation under the WICA entailed an election between seeking compensation under the WICA as opposed to relief under the common law. The Court of Appeal at [24] underscored the point that the decision was important given the differences between the two avenues for seeking relief in terms of what must be proved by the claimant as well as what may be claimed. The Court of Appeal pointed to the fact that whilst the WICA may offer a more certain, faster and cheaper route to recovery, it will also usually result in compensation that is less than what would follow upon a successful claim at common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Court of Appeal at [27] rejected the appellant’s submission that the WICA establishes its own framework which enables a third party to bring a claim on behalf of an injured employee, even where he has not been appointed as a deputy under the MCA. The appellant had argued that the WICA had permissive rules in this regard, and specifically, that the only requirements were that the representative (a) was acting to claim compensation for the benefit of the injured employee; and (b) had no interest adverse to the injured employee (at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Whilst the Court of Appeal agreed at [27] that the WICA contemplated that a third party may make a claim under its provisions on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee (see, for example, ss 12A and 24), the key question was <span class="font-italic">who</span> may make that claim on behalf of an incapacitated employee. The Court of Appeal found that the WICA itself was silent as to which third parties may act on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee and that this was fatal to the appellant’s case. In particular, the Court of Appeal stressed that “if the WICA was intended to establish a regime aside from the MCA enabling a third party other than a deputy to make an election under the WICA on behalf of a mentally incapacitated person, we would expect to find <span class="font-italic">explicit language</span> to that effect” [emphasis in original]. It made no difference if the process for appointing a deputy under the MCA was costly and time-consuming (at [31]). The Court of Appeal held at [31] that the objective of enabling an expeditious and low-cost resolution of work injury claims had “nothing to do with the wholly separate question of who may act on behalf of a mentally incapacitated employee.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80  I pause to comment that the issue of legal capacity is fundamental to the common law system and the bringing of legal proceedings. <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>concerned an individual who suffered serious injuries in a workplace accident which rendered him mentally incapacitated. A mentally incapacitated individual enjoys rights under and according to law. Numerous decisions will have to be made in respect of his rights as determined under or granted by law. Hard choices may have to be made, some of which may have an impact on family, friends and third parties. For example, leaving aside the question of law on the existence and scope of a right for an individual to refuse medical treatment, decisions will have to be made as to whether a comatose victim wants aggressive medical intervention or experimental treatment. Who has the right to make the decision on behalf of the comatose individual?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>concerned the right of the mentally incapacitated victim to bring proceedings for damages against the tortfeasor who caused his injuries. The right to bring such proceedings as allowed under the law “belonged” to the victim and no one else. There was no question of bringing a claim on behalf of the estate: the injured victim was still alive. There was no question of a dependency claim. If the decision was properly made to commence a negligence suit in the courts and the plaintiff-victim subsequently passed away, the cause of action would survive and continue for the benefit of the estate under s 10 of the CLA.<span class="font-italic"> Maran</span>’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>case is authority for the proposition that in such circumstances, the legal representation of the estate must be resolved before the action continues. If there is a will, the named executor is able to apply to be substituted as the plaintiff for and on behalf of the estate. If there is no will, letters of administration will have to be obtained before the application for substitution is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the decision whether to claim compensation under the WICA or bring proceedings for damages for negligence was one which could only have been made by someone with legal authority to make the decision. Rodney, whilst the brother of the mentally incapacitated employee, had not been appointed as a deputy under the MCA. I note that s 23(1) of the MCA empowers the deputy to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, have the conduct of legal proceedings in his name or on his behalf.<span class="font-italic"> Starkstrom </span>makes clear at [31] that just because the WICA is social legislation does not mean that the express provisions and requirements of the MCA on representation of a mentally incapacitated person are overridden or qualified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The present case, however, is different from <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom. </span>The deceased died shortly after the workplace accident. This is not a case of representation of a mentally incapacitated employee. Under s 10 of the CLA, all causes of action vested in him survive for the benefit of his estate. Any damages recovered under the cause of action are for the benefit of the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Given that there is no will or letters of administration, s 37(1) of the Probate and Administration Act vests the deceased’s real and personal estate (including any cause of action which accrued whilst the deceased was alive and which survives his death) in the Public Trustee. It follows that any decision on whether to bring legal proceedings (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in negligence) for and on behalf of the estate under s 10 of the CLA can only be made by the Public Trustee unless and until administrators are appointed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The position of a dependency claim under s 20 of the CLA is more complicated. The dependency claim is distinct from the estate claim and is brought on behalf of the dependants. As noted, the claim under s 20 is ordinarily mounted by the representative of the estate. In the present case, no administrators have been appointed. Under s 20(4) of the CLA, if there is no executor or administrator of the deceased, or if no action is brought within six months after the death by and in the name of an executor or administrator of the deceased, “the action may be brought by and in the name of all or any of the persons for whose benefit an executor or administrator could have brought it” (see [58] above). The deceased passed away on 14 August 2014. The FAS by the respondents (dependants) under the WICA was only made on 22 June 2015, well after the six-month period referred to in s 20(4) had expired. The decision by the dependants in respect of the WICA was made at a time when they could have decided to bring proceedings at common law for damages pursuant to s 20.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For these reasons, I am of the view that <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom </span>does not assist the applicants. Whilst it is true the Court of Appeal highlighted the material differences between the right to claim compensation under common law and the WICA, and the importance of ensuring that the person making an election had been properly cloaked with the authority to do so, this was in the context of an election by a living but mentally incapacitated employee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicability of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Hilton</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I note that in <span class="font-italic">Hilton v Sutton Steam Laundry </span>[1946] KB 65 (“<span class="font-italic">Hilton</span>”) (referred to in <span class="font-italic">Maran </span>at [26]), the plaintiff’s husband died in an accident. She issued a writ against the defendant as administratrix of her husband’s estate, claiming damages for negligence and breach of statutory duty under the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 (c 93) (UK) and the Fatal Accidents Act 1864 (c 95) (UK) (“the Fatal Accidents Acts”) and the 1934 LRA. The statement of claim stated that she was bringing the action “as administratrix of the deceased’s estate for the benefit of such estate” under the 1934 LRA and “for the benefit of herself the sole dependant of the deceased” under the Fatal Accidents Acts (at 66). At the time, letters of administration had not been taken out by the plaintiff.  A grant of administration was only obtained after the statement of claim was issued. The English Court of Appeal held at 70–73 that the writ was a nullity and not validated by the subsequent grant of the letters of administration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The present case is also different from <span class="font-italic">Hilton</span>. Under the Fatal Accidents Acts, the dependency claim could only be brought by the executors or administrators of the estate. That being so, the proceedings commenced by the plaintiff were fundamentally flawed from the start. In the case at hand, the claim by the dependants is not under s 20 of the CLA but under the WICA. Furthermore, the dependants in fact could have chosen to bring an action under s 20 of the CLA in their own names since no executor/administrator had been appointed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other arguments made by the applicants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Assistant Commissioner, in coming to his decision that the respondents had the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to make the WICA claim, referred at [14]–[21] to ss 6 and 9 of the WICA as supporting the conclusion he had reached.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 6(1) provides that compensation under the WICA “shall be payable to or for the benefit of the employee or, where death results from the injury, to the deceased employee’s estate or to or for the benefit of his dependants as provided by this Act.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 9 deals with distribution of compensation (see [43], [45] and [46] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The applicants submit that these provisions are of no assistance as they do not touch on the question as to who has the legal capacity to make a claim under the WICA. The provisions address the question of receipt and distribution of compensation and the right of the Commissioner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Whilst the right to make a claim and the right of the Commissioner to receive and distribute compensation are distinct, I note that s 22(1) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commissioner may receive and pay to dependants, etc., money due from employer to employee who is dead or lacks mental capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) Notwithstanding anything in any written law relating to the administration or distribution of estates of deceased persons for the time being in force in Singapore, where it appears to the Commissioner that compensation or interest is payable to an employee under this Act and the employee has died before such payment is made, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner to receive and pay the compensation or interest, without production of a grant of representation, to any one or more of the dependants of the deceased employee or to the estate of the deceased employee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 One view is that because s 22(1) expressly envisages a scenario whereby the Commissioner receives and pays compensation in circumstances where neither the dependants nor anyone else has obtained a grant of representation over the estate of the deceased, it must follow that Parliament intended for the dependants to have the right to make a claim under the WICA even if no representation to the estate has been obtained. The alternative view is that all s 22(1) is stating is that the Commissioner can make payment to a dependant even if he does not produce the actual grant of representation. Whilst I accept that s 22(1) on its own may not be sufficient to address the question of legal capacity to make claims under the WICA, this does not affect the overall decision that I have come to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The respondents also rely on s 27(1)(<span class="font-italic">bb</span>) of the WICA which states that where a person is dead, the Commissioner can grant leave to the dependants or the estate of the deceased whether or not the estate has obtained a grant of representation, to appear, make applications and perform acts required under the WICA. The applicants, on the other hand, submit that s 27 is only concerned with proceedings under Part III of the WICA which deals matters arising <span class="font-italic">after</span> a valid claim for compensation has been made under s 11. Whilst I recognise the force behind the submission, I am of the view that this also does not affect the overall decision that I have come to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, the applicants also make the point that the FAS was only signed by the 4th respondent (the wife of the deceased).

</div> The other three respondents (the deceased’s children), whilst named as dependants together with the 4th respondent, did not sign the FAS. Regulation 4(2) of the WICR provides that the report to the Commissioner shall be made in writing in such form and manner as the Commissioner may determine. It appears that the FAS was in the form provided by MOM. The 4th respondent was clearly making the Statement as the wife of the deceased. Part 5 of the FAS required the particulars of the dependants.

</div> The FAS was accepted by the MOM. Whilst the applicants submit that it is not known how the 4th respondent derived authority to sign the FAS for the other respondents and indeed whether she was signing on their behalf, I note this does not appear to be a point that was taken during the first tranche or before the Assistant Commissioner when the issue of <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> was raised. In any case, even if one or more of the other respondents did not or do not consent to the 4th respondent’s making of the FAS, this is a matter for them to raise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The overall position on the WICA and the standing of dependants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It is clear that the dependants of a deceased victim possess an independent right to bring an action at common law pursuant to s 20 of the CLA for damages. The action must be brought within three years of the death and is separate from the right of the estate to bring or continue proceedings commenced before the death of the victim. The estate claim, as noted at [55] above, does not extend to claims for lost earnings (post-death). If a dependency claim is brought under s 20, the damages awarded are proportioned according to the losses of the dependants resulting from the deceased’s death (s 22).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96  On the other hand, a dependency claim under the WICA must be brought within one year of the death of the employee (s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). A dependant is someone falling within the definition under s 2(1) (for example, wife and children) irrespective of whether that person is actually dependent on the employee’s earnings or not. Once the compensation amount is determined in accordance in the manner set out in the Third Schedule (s 7), the Commissioner has broad powers of distribution under s 9. This includes authorising payment to one or more dependants of the deceased employee and in such proportion as the Commissioner thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It follows that there are material differences between a dependency claim under s 20 of the CLA and under the WICA. In particular, the amount of payment is likely to be significantly different. A considered decision has to be made by the dependants as to which avenue they choose to proceed under. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the present case, it is evident that the dependants have decided to proceed under the WICA. This is their entitlement. They could have elected to pursue a claim under s 20 of the CLA and start proceedings in court. Whilst dependency claims under s 20 are usually brought on behalf of the dependants by the representatives of the estate, the dependants are able to bring the action in their own name if there is no executor or administrator of the deceased or if no action is brought within six months after the death by and in the name of an executor or administrator of the deceased. This is precisely the case at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99  The <span class="font-italic">Starkstrom</span> and<span class="font-italic"> Maran </span>decisions can be distinguished for the reasons discussed above. I would add that there is no risk of the dependency claim under the WICA shutting out a claim by the estate for damages under s 10. Section 33(2) of the WICA on the limitation of an employee’s right of action to claim damages in court against his employer for injury by accident only applies if he (the employee) has a claim for compensation for that injury under the WICA which he has not withdrawn within the prescribed period. There is no provision that the right of the estate to bring proceedings for damages under s 10 is taken away simply because a dependant has made a dependency claim under the WICA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I note also the decision whether to make a dependency claim under the WICA must be made within a year of the death of the employee (s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). Further, in the event that an individual receives payment for a dependency claim from the Commissioner as a result of a false claim, the Commissioner is empowered to order repayment under s 9(8). For all of these reasons, and notwithstanding the points raised by the applicants on the distinction between <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> and making claims as opposed to provisions on appearance in proceedings and distribution and payment, the applicants have failed in this application to overturn the decision of the Assistant Commissioner below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The appeal is dismissed with costs to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I thank counsel for their learned and helpful submissions.
