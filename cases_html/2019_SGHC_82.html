Under a KODA, the investor purchases a pre-determined number of shares (“underlying shares”) during the term of the KODA, typically between 6 to 12 months. The purchase price of the shares (“strike price”) is fixed at a discount and therefore below the market price of these shares at the time the customer enters into the KODA. The investor agrees to purchase a pre-determined number of shares on each business day at the strike price during the term of the KODA. The investor is therefore obliged to pay for and take delivery of these purchased shares on a regular basis. The termination of the KODA depends on the “knock-out price”, which is a pre-determined price agreed on by the investor:

As it transpired, the investments in structured products, the portfolio of the account and drawdowns on the credit facility led to substantial credit exposure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Sometime around September to October 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked off a global financial crisis by which stock markets worldwide were hit. One of the several ramifications of the crisis was that the AUD rapidly depreciated against the JPY. The sudden and significant depreciation of the AUD against the JPY resulted in Mr Koh sustaining substantial losses as his investments were heavily concentrated in the AUD, while the loans were substantially in the JPY. The corresponding decrease in collateral values resulted in a substantial collateral shortfall in the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 24 October 2008 at about 10am, Mr Koh received a close out notice from the Bank informing him that he had until 2pm to provide a top-up of US$5.7m. Mr Koh claimed that this close out notice gave an unreasonably short length of time for him to furnish additional collateral and that he would have been able to do so had he been given a reasonable amount of time. Further, the entire close out fiasco might have been avoided if he had known that the account was in a collateral shortfall earlier.

The Bank proceeded to close out all of the account’s open investment positions, including the KODAs and DCIs that were then in place, and liquidated all the assets in the account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It was also not really disputed that the KODAs and DCIs and the drawdowns on the credit facility contributed to the collateral shortfall in the account. This shortfall, in turn, led to the eventual close out of the account and the losses that are now the subject of the present action. The ultimate question that falls to be decided is whose responsibility it is to bear the losses arising from the close out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As a result of the close out, Mr Koh suffered losses of US$26m. Mr Koh sought to reclaim his losses by pursuing actions against the Bank for breaches of the Bank’s duties of care in contract and tort, claiming that the Bank failed in its duties by advising him to invest in products that were unsuitable for his purposes and by mismanaging his account. The Bank’s response was that that it owed Mr Koh no duty of care; furthermore, Mr Koh was not a risk-adverse and naive investor. The Bank contended that he had been fully apprised of the risks involved, and had made his own investment decisions that resulted in his losses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiffs’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Mr Koh claimed in both contract and tort. In his closing submissions, emphasis was placed on the claim in tort as opposed to contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In essence, Mr Koh’s case was that the Bank owed him a duty of care, whether in contract or tort, to take reasonable care when giving advice and provide information that met with his investment objective of wealth preservation; in particular, to provide advice on products that suited his purposes. Further, the Bank also owed him a duty of care to advise him in respect of the account; in particular, to carry out periodic reviews of the account, to monitor and manage the investments in the account, and to monitor and inform him of the credit exposure of the account and ensure that the credit limit was not breached.

He had sought riskier investments with the hopes of achieving higher yields and had chosen to engage in leveraged trading. The decision to purchase KODAs and DCIs was part of his investment strategy to capitalise on the falling market in the 2008 financial downturn. In the end, Mr Koh had only his own folly to blame. The Bank never undertook advisory or wealth management obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Mr Koh and had properly provided the necessary information for him to make an informed decision on the purchase of KODAs and DCIs. In this connection, the Bank contended that it owed Mr Koh no duty of care, whether in contract or tort; not least because the account was a non-discretionary account and the contractual terms governing the relationship between the Bank and Smiling Sun and/or Mr Koh excluded any advisory duty.

Indeed, the rule against reflective loss precluded Mr Koh, as Smiling Sun’s shareholder, from bringing a claim against the Bank.

Even if the Bank did owe Mr Koh such responsibilities, the Bank would not have been in breach of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Whether the Bank owed Mr Koh a duty of care depends on the responsibilities it assumed in its dealings with Mr Koh. The starting point of this inquiry would be the contractual relationship between the parties. If the conclusion in respect of the contractual claim was that the Bank undertook no obligation to advise and manage the account, Mr Koh would face an uphill battle in respect of his claim in tort. Further, unless it could be shown that the Bank had acted in a manner which deviated from its contractually defined role, there would be little basis to find that there was a duty of care owed by the Bank to Mr Koh at common law (see <span class="font-italic">Deust</span><span class="font-italic">che Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 886 (“<span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen</span>”) at [51]). Hence, the contractual claim will be considered first and then that in tort. It is essential to distinguish between claims in contract and tort even when these overlap on the facts, as rules relating to various aspects such as remoteness and the measure of damages will differ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Mr Koh, in his submissions, divided the duty of care into several sub-duties: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  a duty of care to advise; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a duty to ensure that the risks of the KODAs and DCIs were explained to the client; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a duty to monitor the account; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) a duty to provide a reasonable period for the provision of additional collateral top-up. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">For clarity, some of these “sub-duties” merely described the responsibilities the Bank was said to have undertaken and do not give rise to distinct “duties” of care. The ultimate inquiry is whether the Bank owed a duty of care to Mr Koh. These responsibilities go towards the scope of such duty or the question of breach (see also <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria </span><span class="font-italic">Creditanstalt AG</span> [2011] 4 SLR 559 (“<span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]–[19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There were many allegations made in the course of the proceedings and Mr Koh’s case did evolve to some extent. I have not found it necessary to address all of the allegations made. My decision was based on what was necessary to resolve the dispute between the parties and hence these grounds of decision will not discuss matters which were tangential. Furthermore, many of the contentions overlapped. The arguments are addressed holistically (in groups) rather than separately. In the end, many of the plaintiffs’ allegations, when weighed against objective documentary evidence, fell away. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contractual claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Mr Koh sought to impose a list of obligations on the Bank in relation to the management of the account (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the recommendation of suitable investments, periodic review of the account, monitoring of the credit limit of the account, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Whether or not a contractual obligation existed depended entirely on the express or implied terms of the agreement between the parties.

In my judgment, there was no basis for such a term to be implied in the contractual relationship of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The court’s approach towards the implication of terms in fact follows a three-step process outlined in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”) at [101]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain whether there is a gap in the contract and if so, how it arose. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court then considers whether it is necessary and not just reasonable, in the business or commercial sense, to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy (“the business efficacy test”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one to which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of formation of the contract (“the officious bystander test”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">No term can be implied that contradicts the express terms; such a term would fail the officious bystander test (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [98]-–[100]). It follows that it would be highly unlikely for the court to discern a gap in the contract if the term sought to be implied is contrary to the tenor of the express terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The relevant contractual document to examine was the credit facility application form (which was countersigned by Mr Koh) (“the form”) which governed the collateral requirements of the account. Under cl 8 of the form, the Bank reserved the right to determine the length of time to be given where a collateral top-up was sought:

The parties had clearly contemplated the period of time to be given to a borrower to furnish additional collateral.

This was not specifically raised by Mr Koh.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The fulcrum was whether there was sufficient legal proximity between the parties. As noted above, there was no contractual obligation for the Bank to provide advice and wealth management. Given this finding, for legal proximity to be sufficiently established, there would have to be particularly cogent evidence that showed that the Bank had assumed additional responsibilities that went beyond the contract through its representations and conduct. To this end, I found that there was no such evidence. Indeed, as a matter of the evidence, it would be highly incongruous for the same parties to go to great lengths to record a non-discretionary contractual arrangement, while at the same time agreeing to a general undertaking to provide investment and wealth management advice that was not so recorded (see also <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Representations made about the incorporation of Smiling Sun</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Mr Koh’s position was that the Bank had voluntarily assumed a higher level of responsibility in relation to Mr Koh and the account. He pointed out that the Bank knew that he was a risk-adverse investor who had the investment objective of wealth preservation. Further, the Bank also knew that he was uninterested in managing the investments in the account. Armed with such knowledge, the Bank, through its representatives, represented that it would advise him in structuring his portfolio and would manage the account on his behalf. Pursuant to its representations, the Bank took active steps in the conduct of the account. It was in this way that the Bank had voluntarily assumed responsibility over the account.

According to Mr Koh, while he rebuffed Ms Kan’s initial attempts at having him invest with the Bank, he was eventually persuaded to do so because Ms Kan had suggested to him that the Bank could create a safe haven for his wealth, and told him that the Bank had dedicated teams to assist him in the management of his investments. She also proposed that a trust company be set up so that the Bank could manage the account on his behalf. Mr Koh relied heavily on the Due Diligence Information Form Ms Kan filled up on 18 September 2003 to show such representation:

He learnt that he should preserve wealth and build wealth offshore as he aspires to retire in Australia or Canada. He is also keen to have access to funds to facilitate his (continuous) support for the poor and the Buddhist community in Tibet and India. As he is divorced and his closest relation is his aged mother (92 years old), he needs to establish a safe haven in the event he is [incapable] of taking care of himself. Ultimately, he would set up a trust for himself and his nieces and adopted children.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Other main reason is that as an established stockbroker, he has opportunities to purchase some blocks of Malaysian shares which he may from time to time, purchase and hold.

And as stated above, it would be highly unusual for the parties to open a non-discretionary account if the Bank had represented that it would manage the account on Mr Koh’s behalf. There is every reason to reduce such an undertaking into contractual terms given that portfolio management is an added service and that it is the customer’s option to open a non-discretionary account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In contrast, the Bank’s evidence was better corroborated. As was recorded in Due Diligence Information Form, it would appear that Mr Koh sought to establish an account with the Bank for the purpose of “consolidating his other offshore accounts with BNP Singapore and Citibank Hongkong to [the Bank] as he found the existing 2 bankers too transactional and product pushing”.

</div> Specifically, in relation to his view on currencies, Mr Koh accepted that he would have had no difficulty making decisions on the basis of his own views even if the Bank suggested otherwise.

</div> Mr Koh’s management of the account was also borne out in the bank’s records. For instance, it can be seen from the call transcripts that Mr Koh himself would refer the Bank’s representatives to his own research. Indeed, in a conversation on 27 May 2008 between Mr Koh and Ms Lew, the former referred the latter to a research report issued by Goldman Sachs.

It had acted consistently with its contractual arrangement with Mr Koh. On the other hand, Mr Koh was active in managing the account. However, for completeness, I shall address some of the points raised by Mr Koh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Mr Koh at trial explained his actions on the basis that he had purchased products on behalf of friends and thus obtained outside research from them.

In the end, the general tenor of Mr Koh’s evidence was that he would first receive a proposal from the Bank, enter into “consultation” with the Bank on the proposal, and then make the decision to enter into a transaction.

</div>
</div> In my view, there is a line between the giving of advice on the one hand, and the solicitation or the provision of information or opinion on the other. Without more, statements from a financial institution in the nature of the latter category are unlikely to attract the legal responsibilities attendant upon the provision of advice. Advice includes more than an exchange of information about a product. It requires the financial institution to take the further step of committing and communicating a considered position to a client with the intention that the analysis provided will be relied on by the client to make an investment decision. From the call transcripts, it was evident that the parties’ conversations were led by Mr Koh. The content of the conversations were simply discussions on possible investment strategies and exchanges of information and opinions (see [76] below). They were not advisory in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Mr Koh also submitted that the Bank did not cede control of Smiling Sun to him at any point in time prior to 2014, this was unsustainable. The Limited Power of Attorney for Asset Manager clearly provided that Mr Koh had the ultimate authority to make investment decisions on behalf of Smiling Sun. Thus, the Bank’s role was limited to executing Mr Koh’s instructions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unilateral conduct of the Bank</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Koh also suggested that the Bank had assumed wider responsibilities in relation to the account, as the Bank had acted unilaterally on several occasions, more notably in respect of increasing the account’s credit limit. I found this contention to be unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The credit limit of the account was increased on several occasions. Mr Koh alleged that (a) some of these increases were done without his knowledge; and (b) the credit limit should never have been breached in the first place as he had instructed the Bank to ensure that the credit limit would not exceed a certain range. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The point that the Bank had acted unilaterally could be readily be disposed of. In so far as the increases in the credit limit from US$5m to US$20m and from US$20m to US$30m were concerned, Mr Koh was furnished with and did counter-sign the confirmation letters for the increases.

</div> As regards the increase from US$2m to US$5m, the short point is this – Mr Koh asserted in his affidavit that he only discovered the increase from US$2m to US$5m after disclosure of documents from the Bank in 2016. He, however, averred that Ms Koh had advised him to increase the credit limit to US$5m in early 2008 and admitted on the stand that he knew of the new credit limit in 2008.

</div> This inconsistency could not be overlooked. Perhaps the most telling piece of evidence was the telephone conversation between Mr Koh, Ms Kan and Ms Koh on 17 October 2008. This conversation was significant because it came shortly after Mr Koh wrote to the Bank and appeared to complain about the increases in the credit facility that were allegedly done without his knowledge:

Not only the KODA positions, but the loans that you were doing, against the DCIs that you were matching. And as you know, we have spoken several times and also with the IC people that, you know currency-wise, we are very sceptical at one point, and we said, “Look, Aussie would be something”, and I remember telling you, Aussie would be something that is, you know, very risky and is the volatility is very great, don’t go all into it.

He clarified that the complaint was about why the US$20m credit limit was crossed. Ms Koh then told him that the products purchased and the drawdowns had led to the breach of the credit limit, and that she had advised him against certain actions which he had gone ahead to carry out.

</div> On the contrary, there was evidence to suggest that Mr Koh had been monitoring the credit limit of the account himself. The evidence disclosed by Mr Koh showed that he had asked for and obtained a total of at least 52 <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> statements of investments and statements of accounts in addition to the regular month-end statements issued by the Bank.

</div>
</div> More importantly, as can be seen from the telephone conversation quoted above (at [61]), the credit limit of the facility had been breached because Mr Koh had disregarded the Bank’s warnings and had gone ahead to make his own investment decisions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Directive D-03380</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Mr Koh further relied heavily on Directive D-03380, a document internally circulated by the Bank which set out the directives on the conduct of relationship managers <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> clients (in particular, the treatment of KODAs and DCIs), among other things. Based on this document, it was suggested that the Bank had assumed a duty of care towards him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Mr Koh’s reliance on Directive-03380 was misplaced. This was an internal document. At the highest, the document might have created obligations between the Bank and its employees. However, in so far as Mr Koh was concerned, the document merely represented best practices. Such a document could not supplant the clear contractual arrangement forged by the parties. I therefore did not find Directive D-03380 to have assisted Mr Koh’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Given how the parties structured their relationship, I did not consider there to be any policy considerations in favour of the imposition of the duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusions on the existence of the duty of care</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The legal responsibilities that attach to a financial institution depend on the specific obligations undertaken by the institution in each particular case. There is no question that financial instruments may involve complex structures and that clients quite naturally expect financial institutions to provide them with the information necessary to make a proper investment decision. However, it must also be remembered that financial institutions are ultimately sellers of their own investment products and operate with a degree of self-interest. Investors must expect a degree of fluff, puff and seller’s optimism, and exercise a degree of caution. Unless a financial institution undertakes to provide additional services such as the giving of advice or management of an account, the responsibility of investing resides in the client. It is incumbent on the client to clarify what he or she does not fully appreciate, as the investment decision is ultimately his or her own. In short, <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">aveat emptor</span>. That is not to say that absent any additional features in the banking relationship, financial institutions do not owe clients any responsibilities whatsoever. If the institution provided false information, the institution may well be liable for the misstatement. But that was not the claim before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The present case parallels <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen </span>in many respects. In <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen</span>, the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the bank in that case did not owe the client a duty of care. Notably, the account was operated as an execution-only (or non-discretionary) account, meaning that the bank’s role was confined to executing orders on behalf of the client in that case. The bank had no discretionary mandate to enter into whatever transactions it thought appropriate having regard to any investment objectives laid down by the client. Further, having regard to the relevant contractual agreements, the bank had not assumed any responsibility to provide advisory services. Even on a consideration of the statements made by the bank to the client, there was no undertaking of any advice or management of the client’s affairs. These statements were in the nature of solicitations or sales pitches and were not an offer to advise on the structuring of the client’s overall portfolio (at [40]–[57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In contrast, while the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap </span>observed that a duty of care arose despite the client having the final say in deciding what products to purchase or sell, the<span class="font-italic"> </span>case was distinguishable. The Court of Appeal’s decision there was in relation to the exercise of skill and care on the part of the bank <span class="font-italic">in discharging the client’s instructions</span> (at [26]–[27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Mr Koh submitted that the non-existence of an advisory relationship was inconclusive of whether there could be a duty of care and drew my attention to portions of <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen </span>to this effect. Be that as it may, there was nothing to show that the Bank had accepted responsibility for the risk of Mr Koh’s investing activities and the affairs of the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Looking at the facts as a whole, I was satisfied that no duty of care existed between the parties in the present case. The Bank had acted within the bounds of its legal relationship with Mr Koh. Whatever “advice” it gave to Mr Koh, be it through recommendations or updates, was simply a goodwill gesture extended to a client. Mr Koh had operated under certain assumptions in his dealings with the Bank, expecting at times that the Bank dissuade him from imprudent decisions. However, Mr Koh had the ultimate responsibility over his own investment decisions and in monitoring the credit limit of the account. He must therefore accept the risk of his purchases and the credit exposure to his account. That the account was eventually closed out was a consequence of Mr Koh’s own doing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicability of the Unfair Contract Terms Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Mr Koh contended that there were clauses in the contract between the parties which purported to exclude or restrict any duty of care owed to him, and that these clauses were unreasonable and unenforceable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chang </span><span class="font-italic">Tse Wen </span>observed that whether contractual provisions are subject to the test of reasonableness under the UCTA depends on whether they have the effect of restricting or excluding a tortious duty (at [68]). The concern is with the substantive effect of the provision rather than form. This is because there have been suggestions that the UCTA merely seeks to address clauses that exclude or restrict liability, obligation or duty, and does not cover clauses which restrict the scope of the duty or obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 While the Court of Appeal’s observations were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, I was satisfied that they are consonant with a purposive interpretation of UCTA. In this regard, the contractual provisions considered in my decision did not have the effect of restricting or excluding a tortious duty. The provisions were intended to merely regulate the relationship of the parties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> each other and define the legal proximity of the parties. This was in contradistinction to provisions that negate a tortious duty. Examples of such provisions may be in the nature of a disclaimer that the aggrieved party accepts and waives liability for negligent acts on the tortfeasor’s part. While some provisions in the contract were in the nature of no-reliance clauses, I had not found it necessary to refer to those provisions in coming to my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breaches of the duty of care</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Much effort was spent by the parties on addressing the issue of whether the Bank had breached its duty to Mr Koh in view of the risks associated with the investments and its failure to monitor and alert Mr Koh about the collateral shortfall in the account. In this regard, even if I were wrong on the question of the existence of the duty, no breach was made out in respect of:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Bank’s introduction of KODAs and DCIs to Mr Koh; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the collateral shortfall in the account and its close out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Introduction of KODAs and DCIs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Mr Koh argued that the Bank committed a breach in introducing KODAs and DCIs to him. He was a risk-adverse investor who knew little about investing apart from his experience in dealing with Malaysian shares. His investment objective was wealth preservation. The Bank had exploited his naivety and had mis-sold him investments that were wholly unsuited to his investment objective. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Koh’s risk appetite</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I found that the Bank did not breach any duty of care in introducing the KODAs and DCIs to Mr Koh. Contrary to what Mr Koh claimed – namely, that he was risk-adverse and none-the-wiser – Mr Koh was in fact an aggressive investor who had been told of and was fully apprised of the risks involved. And if any recommendation was even given, Mr Koh did not rely on such recommendation and acted on his own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Mr Koh’s investment appetite was exemplified by a phone conversation he had with Ms Lew dated 5 October 2007 (at 2.53pm, 3.38pm and 5.01pm):

When it came to the KODAs, Ms Lew could be seen explaining how KODAs operated. Mr Koh would stop Ms Lew when he did not understand her explanation and would then provide his own opinions based on her explanation. It was clear that the product was explained to Mr Koh and that he could understand the mechanics of the product. What was notable in the conversation was Mr Koh’s emphatic response to Ms Lew’s comments on the general lack of appetite by her other clients for risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Mr Koh’s statements to Ms Lew could hardly be said to be that of a conservative investor. Mr Koh knew the risks involved in KODAs and DCIs, and made the decision to enter into those investments with the expectation of higher returns. Whatever Mr Koh’s investment objective might have been at the start, it was clear that by the time he purchased the KODAs and DCIs, his objective was to enhance his returns. Hence, the Bank did not act inconsistently with his investment objective in introducing him to KODAs and DCIs. Similarly, Mr Koh entered into these investments with his eyes open and accepted the risks. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Explanation of risks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In any event, I was also satisfied that the Bank had sufficiently explained the risks involved in the purchase of KODAs and DCIs to Mr Koh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In relation to the KODAs, Mr Koh claimed to have been left in the dark about the difficulties of premature termination (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the penalties to be paid, illiquidity, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) and the multiplying effect of some of the KODAs. In relation to the DCIs, he asserted that he had not been told of the risks involved in such instruments and was ill-advised on the currency pairings. Instead, he was led to believe that DCIs functioned like fixed deposit accounts and thus carried low risk. There was little basis for these claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I begin with the KODAs. The call transcripts showed Ms Lew explaining the KODAs to Mr Koh; in particular, the multiplying effect and difficulties surrounding premature termination of the KODAs. Indeed, Mr Koh accepted during cross-examination that by 11 October 2007, he was aware of the multiplying effect of certain KODAs.

</div> In a call dated 17 October 2008 with Ms Koh and Ms Kan, Mr Koh himself stated that he had been warned of the currency risks and that he bought the DCIs on his own accord: “No one get me into that, okay. That is fair comment. In fact, credit to your girl, she did mention that currency is quite risky, okay”.

</div> I noted portions of the call where Mr Koh asserted that he had been influenced by the Bank’s upselling of the DCIs and took the Bank’s opinion on DCIs into account when making his decision to purchase the DCIs. However, on balance, I was of the view that while the Bank might have upsold their products (as any eager seller would), information and features of the DCIs were ultimately conveyed to Mr Koh for him to make an informed decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As surfaced at the trial, Mr Koh’s position appeared to be that it was insufficient for the Bank to merely bring the risks of products to his attention. The Bank ought to also have him appreciate the risks, in other words, to dissuade him where his investment strategies were imprudent.

</div> To my mind, even if the Bank did have an obligation to advise him, it was difficult to accept the imposition of this more onerous standard of care. The standard of care incumbent on a bank would certainly depend on circumstantial factors. More would be needed before a bank can be said to shoulder a more onerous standard of care. For example, a demonstrable vulnerability on the part of the client would need to be shown. On this note, it was particularly difficult to accept the characterisation that Mr Koh was a clueless investor. He previously held a senior position at one of the top stockbroking houses in Malaysia. It was difficult to imagine that a man of Mr Koh’s calibre and background, with the capability to amass US$26m from the sale of properties in Malaysia alone, would be oblivious to investment matters and reduced to merely rubber-stamping the Bank’s recommendations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Mr Koh attempted to downplay his investment experience by suggesting that he merely fulfilled an administrative role towards the end of his career, was only familiar with Malaysian shares and had lost touch with complex modern-day financial instruments. This was unpersuasive. First, there was nothing to show that the experience he had garnered in the financial industry was not transferrable. Second, and quite crucially, my findings above on Mr Koh’s active role in the account were testament to his abilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Collateral shortfall and close out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In relation to the management of the account, Mr Koh alleged that the Bank misadvised him into applying for a credit facility to finance his trades, failed to review the state of the account, failed to monitor the credit limit of the credit facility, failed to discover the collateral shortfall in a timely manner, and failed to afford him a reasonable amount of time to furnish further collateral. Again, I have not found the Bank to be in breach of its alleged duty of care. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Risk exposure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The risk exposure of the account was the result of two things: (a) the nature of the products the account was concentrated with; and (b) increases in the collateral requirement due to rapid drawdowns on the credit facility. I found that the increased risk exposure of the account was Mr Koh’s own doing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Mr Koh was not unfamiliar with leveraged trading. On Mr Koh’s own evidence, he had previously provided loans for trading to his clients from an account he had with a different bank.

</div> When it came to the Bank, Mr Koh was the one who made the decision to apply for the credit facility as he wanted to carry out trades using the facility. According to Mr Koh, the Bank had advised him to apply for the credit facility as most of his funds were locked up in fixed deposits. However, the documentary record told a different tale. In an email dated 3 May 2006 from Ms Koh to Credit Suisse Trust, Ms Koh recorded that Mr Koh was requesting to apply for a credit facility on an urgent basis to finance his trades.

</div> Hence, contrary to Mr Koh’s case, he had not applied for the credit facility on the advice of the Bank but had himself sought the credit facility to finance his trades. The picture that emerged was that of an investor who made the decision to engage in leveraged trading. It followed that such an investor has to bear the consequences and risks attendant to trading on credit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It is apt at this juncture to mention that under the terms of the application for the credit facility, there were provisions stating that the drawdowns should not exceed the collateral value of the account and that a failure to ensure this might lead to a close out.

The total outstanding for the facility had to be lower than the credit limit or the aggregate collateral value.

</div> Mr Koh alleged that Ms Koh had told him that it was not necessary to read the confirmation letter. However, even if Ms Koh had told him not to read the confirmation letter, Mr Koh was not unfamiliar with the way in which credit facilities operated. In fact, by Mr Koh’s own case, in instructing the Bank to ensure that the credit exposure of the account was kept in check, he must have known the manner in which a credit facility might affect the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In any event, I was satisfied that the Bank did bring to Mr Koh’s attention warning signs as the financial crisis gained traction. At the trial, Mr Koh acknowledged, albeit with some hesitation, that various bank representatives had conveyed to him the level of risk in the account and advised him to deleverage in the months where the account was said to have rapidly deteriorated:

Indeed, the Bank had an interest in keeping Mr Koh’s use of the credit facility in check as the Bank itself was shouldering the risk of his default. It therefore came as no surprise that in the months leading up to the eventual close out of the account, Mr Koh received calls from the Bank indicating the concerning outlook of Mr Koh’s account. However, Mr Koh was steadfast with his investment strategy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Mr Koh made the further point that the Bank had failed to have him truly appreciate the gravity of the situation and had failed to take the extra step of telling him how to mitigate the problems with the account. I was of the view that the standard of care incumbent on the Bank was not to be pitched that high. There were sufficient red flags to indicate that the situation in the account was headed in an unsustainable direction, and possibly to a close out. However, being the aggressive investor that he was, Mr Koh refused to deleverage and continued to enter into further trades that led to the increasing exposure of the account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Close out of the account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I now come to the Bank’s failure to discover the collateral shortfall at an earlier juncture and the short notice provided for Mr Koh to furnish additional collateral. Mr Koh’s point was that had the Bank discovered the collateral shortfall earlier, informed him of the matter and given him more time to furnish collateral, the close out would not have happened. This is because Mr Koh could have taken steps to remedy the situation and was in the position to readily provide the additional collateral. Instead, the close out notice only gave him four hours to furnish additional collateral. While I sympathised with Mr Koh’s plight, having weighed the circumstances, I was unable to agree with Mr Koh that the Bank had breached its duty in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 According to Mr Koh, a collateral shortfall in the account occurred as early as 3 October 2008. However, the Bank only discovered the shortfall on 21 October 2008.

</div>
</div>
</div> Be that as it may, the circumstances were such that even assuming that the Bank had discovered the shortfall at a late juncture, its decision to close out the account was not a breach of its duty of care. Mr Koh had applied for the credit facility as he wanted to engage in leveraged trading. The credit facility application forms clearly spelt out the need to maintain collateral value in the account and the right of the Bank to impose a close out. Mr Koh must therefore be taken to have assumed the risk of a close out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 There was force in Mr Koh’s contention that the time given to furnish additional collateral was unreasonable. This was especially so since he had the capacity to prevent the close out and there had been some success at deleveraging the account prior to the close out. However, this must be weighed against the concerns of the Bank and the unfolding circumstances at the material time. Mr Koh’s investment strategy had hitherto been aggressive, and Mr Koh had not heeded the Bank’s indications to reduce risk and deleverage. Set against the uncertainty of a financial crisis which affected various financial institutions worldwide, the Bank made the decision to exercise its right to close out the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Furthermore, it would appear that at the material time, Mr Koh felt that a close out was a reasonable decision on the part of the Bank. According to the Bank, Mr Koh was contacted about the close out at around 2.27pm on 24 October 2008. During the call, Mr Koh did not raise any objections to the close out, nor did he mention that he could or would top-up the account. Instead, Mr Koh only requested that the liquidation be carried in a managed manner. In a follow-up call, Mr Koh mentioned that there was “no problem, if [the Bank] really want to close [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” and to “[j]ust try to … do it in the ordinary manner”.

Smiling Sun was a special purpose trust vehicle set up with the assistance of the Bank for the benefit of Mr Koh. The Bank knew, for all intents and purposes, that it had to deal with, and did in fact deal, with Mr Koh. Indeed, the Limited Power of Attorney for Asset Manager executed between Mr Koh and Smiling Sun was witnessed by the Bank. Further, the property and assets held by Smiling Sun were that of Mr Koh.

Generally, an action for damages in respect of negligence or breach of duty would be barred if brought six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. However, where the damage is latent, the relevant time period will run three years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff had both the requisite knowledge and a right to bring the action, if that period expires later than the period of six years:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time limits for negligence, nuisance and breach of duty actions in respect of latent injuries and damage</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">24A.</span>—(1) This section shall apply to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract … or independently of any contract …).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) An action to which this section applies, other than one referred to in subsection (2), shall not be brought after the expiration of the period of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) 3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff … first had both the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage and a right to bring such an action, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The requisite knowledge for the purposes of s 24A(3) of the Act is elaborated on in the subsections that follow. Generally, what is required is the knowledge that the damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence or breach of duty, the identity of the defendant and material facts about the damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment (see s 24(4) of the Act). Knowledge includes knowledge which the plaintiff might reasonably be expected to acquire from observable or ascertainable facts (with or without appropriate expert advice which is reasonable for the plaintiff to seek) (see s 24(6) of the Act). It is not necessary that the plaintiff knew the act or omission to involve negligence or breach of duty as a matter of law (see s 24(5) of the Act).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of the law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The parties clashed on the time at which the relevant causes of action accrued.

I treated the argument in respect of the tortious claims to be the same as that in respect of the contractual claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The claims before me were varied – some were premised on contract, others tort; some concerned the Bank’s negligence, others (such as the breach of an implied duty to provide a reasonable time period to furnish additional collateral) did not. Hence, the issues in relation to each claim varied to some degree. I, however, did not propose to address each claim specifically as I had disposed the matter on its merits. It sufficed to say that at the hearing on 7 August 2018, I indicated that substantial parts of Mr Koh’s (or the plaintiffs’) claims were time-barred. I accepted the Bank’s position that the limitation period for the plaintiffs’ contractual and tortious claims accrued from the time that Mr Koh purchased each KODA and DCI. That was the relevant point of time: see John Powell <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Liability </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2017) at para 5-064:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Consistently with the approach to claims against surveyors, solicitors and insurance brokers, a client of a financial adviser will suffer loss and damage when he makes an investment or otherwise acts to his detriment in reliance upon negligent advice. Where the complaint is that the breach of duty by the financial adviser caused the claimant to make an investment which carried a greater degree of risk than was appropriate, damage is suffered when that investment is made and the claimant is exposed to the risk, even if the risk does not materialise at that point and there is a chance that the investment actually made will outperform that which should or would have been made. So in <span class="font-italic">Shore v Sedgwick Financial Services Ltd </span>the claimant had transferred from his occupational pension scheme to a more risky scheme in reliance on the defendant’s advice. Relying on the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Law Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Sephton</span>, the claimant argued that mere exposure to risk was not itself loss, but was equivalent to the exposure to a contingency. Rejecting that argument, Dyson LJ, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, held that the claimant had received an inferior scheme, because it involved a higher degree of risk which he did not want. This did not involve the application of a subjective basis of valuation, rather the Court valued the investment applying the investment criterion which the claimant had stipulated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the claims accrued from the time Mr Koh purchased the KODAs and DCIs, a number of the claims had crossed the six-year limitation period and were time-barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I did not find s 24A(3) of the Act to assist the plaintiffs. The close out notice was issued on 24 October 2008. This would have provided Mr Koh with the requisite knowledge to commence the present action, and the three-year period under s 24(3)(b) would have expired no later than 23 October 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Mr Koh, at the trial, attempted to furnish reasons for the late commencement of the action. He mentioned that he was reeling from the shock of his losses and was implicated in criminal proceedings in Malaysia for alleged murder. To my mind, Mr Koh could have taken out a protective writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 There was also an allegation that the Bank had schemed to have Smiling Sun struck off the BVI register of companies to thwart Mr Koh’s attempts at commencing legal action. The simple point is this – Smiling Sun was restored to the BVI register of companies on 31 October 2013. Suit 1123, however, was only commenced close to a year later on 23 October 2014. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Costs were awarded to the Bank, partly on an indemnity basis following the Bank’s making of an offer to settle.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Mr Koh, the Plaintiff, was not owed any duty or obligation by the Bank in respect of the investments he made, or in respect of the close out of his account. It is always important to bear in mind that the relationship between a client and a bank is governed by the contractual documents that are signed. Contrary to the advertisements that are often put out, this is not a pastel-coloured relationship that is almost familial: a bank looks out for itself and has many lawyers. While exceptions to such relationships may exist, they are likely to be rare, exclusive and expensive for the client.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choh Thian Chee Irving, Kor Wan Wen Melissa and Lim Bee Li (Optimus Chambers LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Alvin Yeo Khirn Hai SC, Daniel Chan, Lim Wei Lee, Noel Chua Yi How, Sanjay S Kumar, Vithiya d/o Rajendra (Wongpartnership LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
