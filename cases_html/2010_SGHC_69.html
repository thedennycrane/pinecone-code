<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by the Law Society of
                    Singapore (“the Law Society”) made under ss 94(1) and 98(1)
                    of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”) against Dixon Ng Bock Hoh (“the Respondent”) to make

                    amended by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society (“the
                    Disciplinary Committee) at the end of the hearing, and to which the Respondent
                    pleaded guilty, read as follows (see <em>Law Society of Singapore

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Re-amended First Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [the Respondent], an Advocate &amp; Solicitor of the Supreme Court
                        are charged that you, in or about December 2005 or January 2006, in
                        Singapore, were guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor
                        as an officer of the Supreme Court and as a member of an honourable
                        profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal

                        “Draft” which purported to be a draft of a judgment for an
                        action in the Subordinate Courts of Singapore which document you knew was
                        false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Re-amended Second Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, [the Respondent], an Advocate &amp; Solicitor of the Supreme Court
                        are charged that you, in or about December 2005 or January 2006, in
                        Singapore, were guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor

                        2005 or January 2006, you prepared a document entitled Judgment between RJ
                        Crocker Consultants Pte and Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd dated
                        14 December 2005 for DC Suit 133553 of 2005 stamped
                        “Draft” which purported to be a draft of a judgment for an
                        action in the Subordinate Courts of Singapore which document you knew was
                        false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After hearing arguments by counsel for the Law
                    Society as well as the Respondent in person, we ordered that the Respondent be
                    suspended from practice for two years, but made no order as to costs. We now
                    give the detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent is an advocate and solicitor of
                    the Supreme Court of Singapore of approximately 17 years’ standing
                    and was practising as a sole proprietor of Messrs Dixon Ng &amp; Co at
                    the material time. The complainant is one Ng Swee How who is also known as
                    Vincent Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On or about June 2001, the complainant engaged
                    the services of the Respondent to represent JCV Consultants (which was a
                    sole-proprietorship owned by the complainant) in its claim against Nortel
                    Networks Pte Ltd for outstanding payment due. The Respondent filed a writ on the
                    complainant’s behalf. However, the writ was not served and the action was
                    deemed to have been discontinued one year after the date of issue of the writ.
                    Subsequently, on or about September 2005, the complainant and the Respondent met
                    again and became business partners for the purposes of developing business
                    contacts in the Middle East. However, by March 2006, their relationship had
                    soured. On 17 April 2006, the complainant informed the Respondent <em>via</em> e-mail that he was terminating their business
                    relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 17 October 2006, the complainant made a
                    complaint to the Law Society against the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before the Disciplinary Committee, there were
                    initially three charges brought against the Respondent. The third charge related
                    to the complainant’s claim that he gave the Respondent a sum of $20,000 to
                    incorporate a company in Dubai, but that the money was not returned to him when
                    he told the Respondent that he had decided not to incorporate the company after
                    all. At the end of the hearing, the Disciplinary Committee held that the third
                    charge was not made out (see the Report at [48]–[49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For our purposes, therefore, we will be
                    focussing only on those parts of the proceedings before the Disciplinary
                    Committee relevant to the present charges against the Respondent (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>). As already noted, the Respondent
                    faced two charges for preparing two court judgments purportedly issued by the
                    Subordinate Courts which he knew were false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The complainant’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The complainant alleged that he had instructed
                    the Respondent to act for him in pursuing two claims. For the first claim, the
                    complainant instructed the Respondent to re-open the file concerning JCV
                    Consultants’ claim against Nortel Networks Pte Ltd. For the second claim,
                    the complainant instructed the Respondent to represent RJ Crocker (which he
                    was a director and shareholder of) against Singapore Agro Agricultural Pte Ltd.
                    Subsequently, the Respondent informed the complainant that he obtained judgments
                    in his favour for both actions (in DC Suit Nos 133418 and 133553 of 2005,
                    respectively). The Respondent then gave him copies of the two judgments. In
                    reality, no such judgments were issued by the Subordinate Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Respondent’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Respondent did not dispute that he had
                    produced the two “judgments” purportedly issued by the Subordinate
                    Courts, which he knew were false. However, the Respondent claimed that he was
                    not acting in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor for the complainant;
                    that the complainant knew that the “judgments” were not real; that
                    the judgments were stamped with the word “DRAFT”; that they were
                    produced at the request of the complainant as part of a “wife placation
                    exercise”; and that he had never intended to represent such documents as
                    genuine court documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Respondent stated that he and the
                    complainant were friends and business partners, and that the complainant had
                    confided in him about his marital problems. The complainant’s marital
                    problems stemmed from his affair with a lounge hostess who absconded with
                    $150,000 of his wife’s money. As a result of this incident, the
                    complainant owed his wife $150,000. Since then, the complainant’s wife had
                    harassed the complainant and restricted his expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We turn now to consider the “wife
                    placation exercise” proper. According to the Respondent, the complainant
                    had sought the assistance of the Respondent to ameliorate the situation with his
                    wife. The complainant requested, and the Respondent agreed to lend money to the
                    complainant, in order that the complainant would be able to repay the money owed
                    by him to his wife. The complainant subsequently requested that the Respondent
                    produce court “judgments” so that the complainant could show his
                    wife that monies were forthcoming. The Respondent again agreed and duly produced
                    the “judgments”. These “judgments” resembled actual
                    court judgments and even bore the “signature” of the Deputy
                    Registrar of the Subordinate Courts. Having created these
                    “judgments”, the Respondent was, however, concerned that they
                    might be used to mislead third parties (other than the complainant’s
                    wife). Therefore, the Respondent stamped the word “DRAFT” on them.
                    The Respondent then gave to the complainant photocopies of the
                    “judgments” and left it to the complainant to decide what to do
                    with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thus, the production of the two
                    “judgments”, as explained by the Respondent, was part of a
                    “wife placation exercise” to make the complainant’s wife
                    believe that the complainant would be receiving money from his legal actions so
                    as to alleviate the harassment by his wife. The Respondent claimed that he acted
                    as a friend and out of care and concern for the complainant’s
                    well-being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The findings of the Disciplinary Committee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After hearing the evidence of the complainant
                    and Respondent, the Disciplinary Committee was of the view that the complainant
                    was not a witness of truth, and that he “was very evasive during
                    cross-examination, and was found lying at numerous parts of his evidence”
                    (see the Report at [37]). Instead, the
                    Disciplinary Committee accepted the Respondent’s evidence, finding that
                    “the Respondent was trying to help [the complainant] to continue his
                    business activities without any interference from his wife” (see the
                    Report at [39]). The Disciplinary Committee also found that the Law Society had
                    failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the judgments did not have the word
                    “DRAFT” stamped on them (see the Report at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Nevertheless, the Disciplinary Committee held
                    (at [44]) that even if they accepted the Respondent’s evidence that he had
                    stamped the word “draft” on the two “judgments” and
                    that the Respondent was not acting in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor,
                    the production of the two “judgments” was conduct unbefitting of
                    an advocate and solicitor. In this regard, the Disciplinary Committee observed
                    (see the Report at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, there was clearly an element of deceit in what the Respondent
                        did when he created the false draft judgments. We find the
                        Respondent’s conduct to be dishonest and unbefitting of an advocate
                        and solicitor as an officer of the court and as a member of an honourable
                        profession. The false documents which were created in this case purported to
                        be drafts of judgments to be issued by a court of law. His conduct struck at
                        the administration of justice. As an officer of the court, the Respondent
                        was duty bound to uphold the integrity of the system for the administration
                        of justice. Instead he had done otherwise. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Disciplinary Committee therefore
                    determined that under s 93(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act,
                    cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed against the
                    Respondent under s 83 of the same. However, the Disciplinary Committee
                    amended the charges as framed by the Law Society to include the words
                    “stamped draft” and also to remove references to
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act. The Respondent
                    pleaded guilty to the amended charges (see above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The issues before this court were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether due cause for disciplinary
                        action against the Respondent under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act had been shown; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     if so, what was the appropriate
                        penalty to be imposed on the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The relevant provision is s 83(2)
                        (<em>h</em>) of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Section 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act provides that due cause may be shown against an

                    member of an honourable profession”. As this court observed in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 466 (“<em>Ng Chee
                    Sing</em>”) at [40]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act is a catch-all provision
                        which can be invoked when the conduct does not fall within any of the other
                        enumerated grounds but is nevertheless considered unacceptable. It was
                        stated in Law Society of Singapore v Khushvinder Singh Chopra [[1998]
                        3 SLR(R) 490] that unlike “grossly improper conduct”
                        in s 83(2)(b), “conduct unbefitting an advocate and
                        solicitor” is not confined to misconduct in the solicitor’s
                        professional capacity but also extends to misconduct in the
                        solicitor’s personal capacity. It follows that the standard of
                        unbefitting conduct is less strict and, as stated in In re Weare, a
                        Solicitor; In re The Solicitors Act, 1888 [1893] 2 QB 439, a solicitor
                        need only be shown to have been guilty of “such conduct as would
                        render him unfit to remain as a member of an honourable
                        profession”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And, in the decision of this court in <em>Law Society
                        of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 308 (“<em>Ahmad
                    Khalis</em>”), it was observed (at [80]) that “the focus of
                        [s 83(2)(<em>h</em>)] is on the conduct of the
                    solicitor – in particular to ensure that the conduct of the solicitor
                    concerned meets the high levels of professionalism expected of practising
                    lawyers”. It was also established by this court, in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Arjan Chotrani Bisham</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 231 (at [34]), that “under s 83(2)(h) the
                    solicitor’s misconduct has to be unbefitting an advocate and solicitor and
                    that the standard of judgment to be applied is fixed by the court and is not the
                    standard of peer judgment (Law Society of Singapore v Heng Guan Hong Geoffrey
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law Society’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Law Society relied on the findings of the
                    Disciplinary Committee and the guilty plea of the Respondent to contend that due
                    cause for disciplinary action under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act had been shown. Even though the Respondent acted to
                    help a friend, the production of false court documents was misconduct
                    unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor. However, the Law Society made no
                    submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As noted above, the Respondent acknowledged
                    that he was guilty of conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor. He also did
                    not contest that due cause for disciplinary action against him had been
                    shown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Taking the Respondent’s case at its
                    highest, the situation may be succinctly described as follows. The Respondent
                    had the best of intentions in creating the false court documents, <em>viz</em>, to aid his erstwhile friend and business partner in
                    what was (in his words) a “wife placation exercise”. He therefore
                    received no benefit himself. Further, the orders were stamped with the word
                    “draft” and were therefore not passed off as being final court
                    orders. The Respondent therefore urged this court to impose a lenient penalty in
                    the light of the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before considering the <em>substance</em> of what the Respondent effected through the drafting
                    of such (false) orders, let us first consider his argument based on best
                    intentions and the attendant absence of personal benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As this court pointed out in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ong Ying Ping</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 583 (“<em>Ong Ying
                    Ping</em>”) at [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if we assume that the respondent had his own “noble”
                        reasons for doing what he did, the ends could never justify the means. One
                        cannot divorce the means from the ends. Where improper means are utilised,
                        the ends, no matter how noble or desirable they might otherwise be, are
                        almost invariably tainted and sullied. There are in fact two consequences
                        arising as a result. The first is that the use of improper means is itself
                        wrong and the second (as just mentioned) is that the otherwise noble ends
                        themselves are also tainted and sullied as a result. This would of course
                        be, a fortiori, the case if the respondent had less than noble reasons.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In any event, the ends sought to be achieved
                    by the Respondent in the present case were far from noble. Whilst the Respondent
                    described his actions as constituting a “wife placation exercise”
                    it was, in effect, more of a “wife <em>deception</em> exercise”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, <em>even
                        assuming</em> that the ends sought to be achieved were in fact noble,
                    it did <em>not</em> (as pointed out above) justify the
                    means utilised. This is an appropriate juncture at which to turn to consider
                        <em>the means</em> utilised by the Respondent, which
                    consisted in the drafting of <em>false court
                    documents</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It is important to note that the Respondent,
                    as an advocate and solicitor, “shall be <em>an officer of
                        the Supreme Court</em>” (emphasis added) (see s 82(1) of
                    the Act). It is also important to remind ourselves of the declaration which each
                    lawyer makes when admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court.
                    The declaration is to be found in s 24 of the Act, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Declaration, duty and
                            roll</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>24</b>.-(1) Every person admitted as an
                        advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court shall make the declaration set
                        out in subsection (2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subject to any
                            necessary modification to conform to the religious beliefs of the
                            applicant for admission, the declaration shall be in the following
                            form:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>“</em>I, A.B., do solemnly and
                            sincerely declare (and swear) that I will truly and honestly conduct
                            myself in the practice of an advocate and solicitor according to the
                            best of my knowledge and ability and according to law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(So help me God)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As this court observed in <em>Narindar Singh Kang v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 641 at [50]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    It is a solemn declaration which, though outwardly
                            simple, is pregnant with meaning. It is a declaration by the lawyer
                            concerned that he or she will not only exercise his or her professional
                            knowledge and skills to the best of his or her ability as well as
                            according to law, but (and more importantly) that such knowledge and
                            skills will be exercised “truly and honestly”. This
                            signifies a duty not merely to oneself and to one’s client, but
                            also to the court and to the attainment of justice and fairness
                            generally. Indeed, the pursuit and attainment of justice and fairness is
                            central to one’s role as an advocate and solicitor. Any conduct
                            which sullies such an ideal not only damages the reputation of the
                            lawyer concerned but (more importantly) constitutes a blow against this
                            ideal - especially in the eyes of the public. This ideal is a very real
                            one …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prof Jeffrey Pinsler, in his seminal work, Ethics and
                        Professional Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor (Academy
                        Publishing, 2007), also aptly observes thus (at
                        paras 01-108–01-109):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The oath binds the person taking it for the entire length of his
                            career, although the number of disciplinary actions taken against
                            advocates and solicitors may indicate that it has too often been
                            honoured in the breach. Three phrases ring out: “truly and
                            honestly conduct myself”; “according to the best of my
                            knowledge and ability”; and “according to
                            law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Referring to the oath that they had just taken, the Chief
                            Justice, in his address to newly admitted advocates and solicitors on
                            20 May 2006, said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">Bear in mind always that a lawyer’s first and foremost duty
                                is to uphold the principles of honesty, integrity and
                                professionalism. This is reflected in the oath that you have just
                                taken this morning ... .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this case, the Respondent, by creating
                    false court documents in order to placate the complainant’s wife, had
                    acted (to say the least) in a less than professional manner and had thereby
                    contravened the declaration he took on the occasion of being admitted as an
                    advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court. Indeed, as counsel for the Law
                    Society, Mr Vijai Parwani, submitted (correctly, in our view), there are
                    certain lines that cannot be crossed by an advocate and solicitor and, on this
                    particular occasion, the Respondent had crossed the line because the means he
                    employed involved court documents which embodied (by their very nature) a high
                    measure of sanctity. Court documents are intended to facilitate the attainment
                    of a just and fair decision by the court itself. In other words, they are not
                    merely the tools of the lawyer’s trade but are also the means through
                    which justice and fairness are achieved. The use – or, in this case, abuse
                    – of them for any other reason (even one as unusual as that in the present
                    case) not only demonstrates a lack of respect for the court process but is also
                    anathema to the very ideals which constitute the very pith and marrow of the law
                    itself. In this regard, we rejected the Respondent’s contention that the
                    documents concerned were only marked as drafts. Indeed, a close examination of
                    the said documents revealed that they were intended to be passed off as
                        <em>genuine</em> court documents (albeit in highly
                    unusual as well as narrow circumstances). Their format and language were
                    precisely what one would expect to see in a proper court judgment. This was no
                    mere amateurish effort but one that would probably have even convinced a lawyer
                    that it was an authentic court document – not to mention a layperson. The
                    Respondent conducted himself as he did precisely in order that the
                    complainant’s wife be convinced that the documents concerned were
                    authentic, thereby succeeding in the “wife placation exercise”. In
                    the circumstances, this was clearly conduct which constituted a breach of
                    conduct pursuant to s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentence imposed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The mitigating factors the Respondent urged us
                    to take into account have, in fact, already been referred to above (at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). In particular, he emphasised the fact that
                    his intention was to aid the complainant in a “wife placation
                    exercise” and that he received no personal benefit in return. He also
                    stated that he had stamped the word “draft” on the documents to
                    ensure that they were not passed off as final judgments. We have already
                    considered this last-mentioned argument (above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>) and found it to be wholly without merit. The only
                    mitigating factors that were relevant in the context of the present proceedings,
                    therefore, were that the Respondent had acted with good intentions and that he
                    had received no personal benefit in return.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     What was clear was that the Respondent had
                    not, in the circumstances, been guilty of dishonest conduct (as compared, for
                    example, to the respondent in <em>Law Society of Singapore v
                        Khushvinder Singh Chopra</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490 (where the
                    charges against the lawyer concerned were also brought pursuant to
                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act) as well as the
                    respondents in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Heng Guan Hong
                        Geoffrey</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 and <em>Ng
                        Chee Sing</em> (where the charges against both the lawyers concerned
                    were brought pursuant to s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) and
                        (<em>h</em>) of the Act)). This was an important
                    consideration because dishonest conduct almost invariably results in the lawyer
                    concerned being struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme
                    Court (“the roll”). Although the Disciplinary Committee in the
                    present proceedings did (in passing) characterise the Respondent’s conduct
                    as “dishonest” (see the Report at [56] and above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>), one should view this observation as
                    precisely that – a passing (and very general) observation that ought to be
                    viewed in its <em>context</em> (which focused, in the main,
                    on the <em>general</em> element of deceit in relation to
                        <em>false</em> court documents). The Respondent’s
                    conduct was intended solely as a “wife placation exercise”,
                        <em>as opposed to a deliberate attempt to deceive a client
                        and/or the court in the context of actual court (or court-related)
                        proceedings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, it does <em>not</em> follow that an absence of dishonesty will <em>never</em> result in an advocate and solicitor being struck off the
                    roll. In the oft-cited words of Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the English Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Bolton v Law Society</em> [1994]
                    1 WLR 512 at 518:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any solicitor who is shown to have discharged his professional duties with
                        anything less than complete integrity, probity and trustworthiness must
                        expect severe sanctions to be imposed upon him ... Lapses from the required
                        high standard may, of course, take different forms and be of varying
                        degrees. The most serious involves proven dishonesty, whether or not leading
                        to criminal proceedings and criminal penalties. In such cases the tribunal
                        has almost invariably, no matter how strong the mitigation advanced for the
                        solicitor, ordered that he be struck off the Roll of Solicitors. Only
                        infrequently, particularly in recent years, has it been willing to order the
                        restoration to the Roll of a solicitor against whom serious dishonesty had
                        been established, even after a passage of years, and even where the
                        solicitor had made every effort to re-establish himself and redeem his
                        reputation. If a solicitor is not shown to have acted dishonestly, but is
                        shown to have fallen below the required standards of integrity, probity and
                        trustworthiness, his lapse is less serious but it remains very serious
                        indeed in a member of a profession whose reputation depends upon trust. A
                        striking off order will not necessarily follow in such a case, but it may
                        well. The decision whether to strike off or to suspend will often involve a
                        fine and difficult exercise of judgment, to be made by the tribunal as an
                        informed and expert body on all the facts of the case. Only in a very
                        unusual and venial case of this kind would the tribunal be likely to regard
                        as appropriate any order less severe than one of suspension. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may also be made to the decision of this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 266 (“<em>Ravindra
                    Samuel</em>”) at [14]–[15].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In assessing the gravity of the misconduct,
                    and hence the severity of the penalty, the decisions in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Wee Wei Fen</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 559
                        (“<em>Wee Wei Fen</em>”) and <em>Re Advani Jiwat G</em> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 98
                        (“<em>Re Advani Jiwat G”</em>)
                    are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The fact situation in the present proceedings
                    may be <em>contrasted with</em> that in <em>Wee Wei Fen</em>, where the lawyer concerned was convicted of two
                    charges of forgery and one charge of cheating (with ten other charges being
                    stood down by the Prosecution). The lawyer was subsequently struck off the roll.
                    It should be noted that the lawyer in question effected forgeries of both a
                    cheque as well as an order of court in order to deceive the lawyer for the other
                    party as well as one of her clients, respectively. Indeed, both acts of forgery
                    were not only carried to completion but also stemmed from the lawyer’s
                    attempts to cover up her blatant professional inaction in both the situations
                    concerned. She was <em>also</em> found guilty of cheating
                    inasmuch as she had utilised a sum in her firm’s client account belonging
                    to one client in order to make an unauthorised payment to another law firm
                    pursuant to a settlement which had not in fact been authorised by yet another
                    client in the first instance. The lawyer pleaded guilty to all three charges and
                    was sentenced to a total of four months’ imprisonment. As already
                    mentioned, <em>Wee Wei Fen</em> related to disciplinary
                    proceedings brought against the lawyer pursuant to s 83(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act (which relates to a situation where an
                    advocate and solicitor “has been convicted of a criminal offence,
                    implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession”.
                    The court observed (at [38]) that “[t]here was no doubt … that all
                    three offences in this case involved an element of <em>dishonesty
                        and fraud</em>” (emphasis added). It proceeded to observe (at
                    [38]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]heir gravity was further compounded by the fact that the respondent had
                        committed them in her professional capacity as an advocate and solicitor and
                        had abused her position as a member of a respected and honourable profession
                        … Despite being an officer of the court, the respondent had
                        nevertheless audaciously sought to pervert the course of justice by
                        fabricating court documents. She had also consistently failed in her duty to
                        not one, not two but at least three of her clients to act in their best
                        interests. In the circumstances, we had no doubt that her behaviour cannot
                        in any way be countenanced. To do so would be to set an unacceptable
                        precedent for other like-minded lawyers to do the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Another decision that might be noted briefly
                    is that of this court in <em>Re Advani Jiwat G</em>,
                    where the facts were (like those in the present proceedings) highly unusual. The
                    lawyer concerned was so distraught on learning of his father-in-law’s
                    passing that he sought to prepare a forged will purportedly made by the latter
                    and leaving all the property to his (<em>ie</em>, his late
                    father-in-law’s) wife (to the exclusion of five daughters, which, of
                    course, included the said lawyer’s wife). Counsel for the lawyer pointed
                    out, in this regard (at [5]), that the lawyer “wished to give effect to
                    the wishes or intention of his late father-in-law, which the latter had
                    expressed in his lifetime that should he predecease his wife, as it had
                    happened, all his property should go to his wife”. As it turned out, the
                    deceased’s five daughters subsequently agreed, in fact, to renounce
                    whatever claims they had against their late father’s estate in favour of
                    their mother and effected this through a deed of renunciation. The court held
                    that no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under what
                    is presently s 83 of the Act and further held that a severe reprimand from
                    the Disciplinary Committee would suffice. It was important to note that, in that
                    case (which did not involve any interaction with clients or the court), the
                    court took pains (at [6]) to “emphasise strongly the exceptional
                    circumstances” and the fact that, whilst such conduct was to be
                    deprecated, such acts also constituted <em>preparatory</em>
                    acts which the lawyer <em>wholly abandoned</em> once he had
                    been alerted of their impropriety by his secretary (reference may also be made
                    to the decision of this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v
                        Tan Buck Chye Dave</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 581 as well as
                    Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Ethics and Professional Responsibility: A
                        Code for the Advocate and Solicitor</em> (Academy Publishing, 2007) at
                    para 01-087).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Returning to the facts of the present
                    proceedings (which, for reasons set out below, lay (in our view) between those
                    in <em>Wee Wei Fen</em> and <em>Re Advani
                        Jiwat G</em>, respectively), we were of the view that the
                    Respondent’s good intentions could, at the very best, go only towards
                    mitigating what would have otherwise been a more severe sentence which would
                    have been meted out on him. If, for example, the Respondent had, in fact,
                    utilised false court documents to deceive the court in order to gain a personal
                    advantage for himself, that would have clearly been conduct that justified
                    striking him off the roll. In the present proceedings, however, the false
                    documents were only intended to be shown to the complainant’s wife in
                    order to placate her <em>vis-à-vis</em> the complainant.
                    The Respondent truly believed he was doing the complainant a favour, although he
                    now acknowledged that his conduct was improper. On the other hand, we pause to
                    observe that if such conduct was not sanctioned appropriately, there would (as
                    the Disciplinary Committee noted (see the Report at [56] as well as above at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>)) also be an undermining of public
                    confidence in the administration of justice. Indeed, as this court observed in
                        <em>Ong Ying Ping</em> (at [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We note, further, that the respondent [<em>viz</em>,
                        the lawyer in the case] is an officer of the court. His task is to aid in
                        the administration of justice, not to undermine it. Integrity and honesty
                        are not simply necessary; they are the qualities that every legal
                        practitioner must possess, for without them, the entire reputation of the
                        law will be forfeit. The legal profession aids, immeasurably, in the
                        administration of justice. Its reputation in the eyes of the public must be
                        maintained and even enhanced wherever possible. The signal importance of
                        this last-mentioned point centring on public confidence is vital and cannot
                        be overemphasised. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, this court observed, in <em>Ahmad
                        Khalis</em> (at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The legitimacy of the administration of justice in the eyes of the public
                        cannot be gainsaid. Respect for the law as viewed through the lenses of the
                        public is an indispensable element in the fabric of the system of justice.
                        Indeed, the public constitutes the ultimate body of individuals for whose
                        benefit the law and the legal system exist. To this end, anything which
                        undermines public confidence in the competence and/or professionalism of
                        lawyers must not - indeed, cannot - be permitted. As we shall elaborate upon
                        below, the focus should be the precise opposite - to enhance the standing
                        and (more importantly) accessibility of the legal profession in the eyes of
                        the public. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following observations by this court in <em>Ravindra Samuel</em> (at [11], and which also focus on the need to
                    protect the public against similar defaults by other solicitors) should also be
                    noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    ... It is not simply a question of punishing the
                            solicitor concerned. A further consideration must be what course should
                            the court take to protect the public and to register its disapproval of
                            the conduct of the solicitor. <em>In the relevant sense,
                                the protection of the public is not confined to the protection of
                                the public against further default by the solicitor in question. It
                                extends also to the protection of the public against similar
                                defaults by other solicitors through the court publicly marking the
                                seriousness of what the instant solicitor has done. The orders made
                                must therefore accord with the seriousness of the default and leave
                                no doubt as to the standards to be observed by other practitioners.
                                In short, the orders made should not only have a punitive, but also
                                a deterrent effect</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    There are also the interests of the honourable
                            profession to which the solicitor belongs, and those of the courts
                            themselves, to consider. The administration of justice can only proceed
                            on the basis that solicitors can place reliance upon the honesty of the
                            solicitors with whom they deal. <em>The public too must
                                be able to repose confidence in a profession which plays so
                                indispensable a part in the administration of justice</em>.
                            Similarly, the courts of this country must be able to depend on the
                            honesty and integrity of all practitioners appearing before them and to
                            expect that they will maintain the highest standards of personal honesty
                            and integrity in their dealings with the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, it was also important to note (as
                    already alluded to above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>) that the
                    facts of the present proceedings were <em>highly
                        unusual</em>, to say the least. In particular, although there were
                    wider implications as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the actual effect of
                    the Respondent’s conduct in the context of the actual situation itself was
                    very narrow. In those circumstances, and taking into account the fact that the
                    Respondent was attempting to do the complainant a favour without receiving any
                    personal benefit in return, we were of the view that suspending the Respondent
                    from practice for two years was an appropriate sanction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As the Law Society stated that it was not
                    seeking the costs of the present proceedings, we made no order as to costs, save
                    that the Respondent was to pay the cost of disbursements to the Law
                    Society.</p>
