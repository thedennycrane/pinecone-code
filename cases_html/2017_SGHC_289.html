All of the URA’s grants of written permission imposed use restrictions on the defendant which mirrored those in the head lease.

But the tribunal went on to find that the plaintiff did not rely on the representation because the plaintiff had in fact given no conscious thought whatsoever to the issue of public access to the facilities at the time that that second representation was made.

It is not and was not entitled to rescind the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The important point to note about the tribunal’s reasoning is that any finding as to whether any of the 17 representations was false or had been made dishonestly was wholly unnecessary for the tribunal to dispose of the plaintiff’s claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. The tribunal’s findings meant that it was wholly unnecessary to go beyond [30(b)] above for 15 of the representations or to beyond [30(d)] above for the two surviving representations. In other words, the plaintiff’s case in fraudulent misrepresentation had failed well before the tribunal came to analyse, as it did, whether the alleged representation was false in the sense claimed by the plaintiff and whether the defendant had been dishonest in the sense required by the tort.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fraud on the URA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In addition to contending that the defendant had perpetrated a fraud upon the plaintiff, the plaintiff also contended that the defendant had perpetrated a fraud upon the URA.

</div> It arrived at this belief based on professional advice from the project architects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The project architects’ advice to the defendant was that the URA had two underlying concerns in imposing the restriction on members of the public patronising the facilities. The first was to ensure that the defendant or, more accurately, its operator would run the facilities as an integral part of the business rather than hive the facilities off to another party for them to be run independently. The second concern was to ensure that the defendant and its operator would not specifically target members of the public to patronise the facilities.

The plaintiff’s case, further, was that the defendant’s breach of the head grant constituted a breach of the defendant’s express warranty in the SPA that it was not in breach of the head grant.

</div> The tribunal rejected this contention. The warranty was expressly qualified by the words “So far as [the defendant] is aware”. This proviso, as defined in the SPA, meant that the plaintiff’s contention could not succeed unless the plaintiff could prove that the defendant had actual knowledge that it was in breach of the head grant. But the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence as to the state of the defendant’s knowledge of the impact of the breach of the URA’s restriction on the head grant. In any event, given the tribunal’s finding that the defendant had relied on the project architects’ advice and honestly believed that allowing members of the public to patronise the facilities was not contrary to the use restriction, the tribunal found that it was highly unlikely that the defendant had actual knowledge that it was in the breach of the head grant.

</div> The plaintiff’s arguments are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the plaintiff argues that it had no notice that the URA’s policy would be an important issue in the arbitration. More fundamentally, it claims that there was a breach of natural justice because it was not given an opportunity to be heard on what the URA’s policy is.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it submits that the tribunal erred in admitting and giving weight to hearsay evidence. Specifically, the tribunal should not have admitted evidence from the defendant as to what the project architects had advised it in relation to the URA’s policy and use restriction without giving the plaintiff the chance to cross-examine the project architects. The plaintiff further argues that the tribunal gave undue weight to the project architects’ advice and was “clearly influenced in its reasoning process by virtue of this advice”

</div> the tribunal made no finding that the project architects’ advice was correct, whether about the URA’s policy or about anything else. Once again, the tribunal simply assumed in the plaintiff’s favour at [127] of the award that the project architects’ advice was wrong (quoted at [66] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No breach of the hearsay rule</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As for the plaintiff’s submissions on the hearsay rule, they are doubly misconceived.  First, the hearsay rule does not apply in arbitration. Second, even if the rule does apply, the defendant’s evidence of what the project architects told it is not hearsay when it comes to making a finding about the defendant’s state of mind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Hearsay rule does not apply</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 What is commonly called the hearsay rule in litigation before the Singapore courts is in fact the requirement in s 62 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) that oral evidence in all cases must be direct evidence. The section then defines direct evidence, in connection with evidence of fact, as being evidence from a witness who is able to say from his own personal knowledge that the factual content of his evidence is true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Section 62 is found in Part II of the Evidence Act. Section 2(1) of the Evidence Act expressly provides that Part II of that Act, amongst others, shall not apply to proceedings before an arbitrator. If there is a hearsay rule in Singapore arbitration, it must be found outside the Evidence Act. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Permasteelisa</span><span class="font-italic"> Pacific Holdings Ltd v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 270 at [32] after citing s 2 of the Act, “[I]n arbitration proceedings, generally, the law of hearsay and the manner of proving the truth of written statements <span class="font-italic">as set down in the Evidence Act</span>, are not applicable.” [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Despite the existence of the Evidence Act, there continues to be a common law of evidence in Singapore. Section 2(2) of the Act provides only that common law rules of evidence which are inconsistent with the Act are repealed, not that <span class="font-italic">all</span> common law rules of evidence are repealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I shall therefore assume in favour of the plaintiff, without deciding, that the rule against hearsay is part of the common law of evidence in Singapore and, further, that it applies to proceedings before an arbitrator. The second assumption is an exceedingly generous assumption to make in favour of the plaintiff. I say that because it is not at all apparent that the legislature intended – when it freed proceedings before an arbitrator from the technicalities of the rules of evidence found in the Evidence Act – to subject those proceedings to the equally arcane rules of evidence at common law.  Indeed, there is an almost insurmountable argument to be made that in all arbitrations conducted with Singapore as the seat, the tribunal is empowered to receive all relevant evidence, with the concerns which underlie the exclusionary rules at common law such as the hearsay rule going only to weight and not to admissibility. That principle of free admissibility would be subject only to the parties’ agreement and to principles of public policy, which will include the rules of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I nevertheless assume in the plaintiff’s favour that this eminently sensible position is wrong. I do that in part because counsel for the plaintiff reframed his objection during oral submissions as being based not on the tribunal’s decision to receive hearsay evidence but on the fact that the plaintiff was denied an opportunity to cross-examine the project architects because the defendant did not call them as witnesses in the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 At common law, not every out of court statement falls within the hearsay rule. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez </span><span class="font-italic">Kee v PP </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 447, the Court of Appeal observed at [70] that a statement made out of court is hearsay and inadmissible only if adduced to prove the truth of the facts set out in the statement. Evidence of a statement made out of court which is adduced to establish only that the statement was <span class="font-italic">made</span> (as opposed to establishing that the contents of the statement are <span class="font-italic">true</span>) does not infringe the hearsay rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The defendant’s evidence of the project architects’ advice is not hearsay.  That evidence of the architects’ advice was not adduced to prove: (a) what the URA’s policy actually was; or (b) that the project architects’ advice about that policy or use restriction was correct. Instead, the defendant adduced this evidence to prove only that that the project architects gave that advice. That was then supplemented with direct evidence that the defendant honestly believed that advice to be correct. The rule against hearsay was not engaged at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The tribunal accepted both aspects of the defendant’s evidence, as it was its prerogative to do. The plaintiff cannot complain that the tribunal’s findings are wrong in fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The plaintiff’s argument that there was a breach of natural justice in receiving evidence of the architects’ advice without a witness from the architects proving it is wholly misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The tribunal’s findings about the project architects’ advice and the defendant’s belief in that advice establishes further that the tribunal’s decision on the lawfulness of the SPA (see [43]–[46] above) was not tainted by any breach of the fair hearing rule. The plaintiff points to paragraph 78 of the award

</div> where the tribunal addresses the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant was committing a fraud against the URA. In this paragraph, the tribunal examines the evidence in relation to the project architects’ advice and the URA’s use restriction before rejecting the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant was guilty of a fraud on the URA. Before me, the plaintiff points to a number of instances in the award where the tribunal refers to paragraph 78 of the award to justify its findings that the defendant did not perpetrate a fraud or that the SPA was not a sale of an unlawful business.

</div> The plaintiff submits that these repeated references to paragraph 78 show that the tribunal’s assessment of the evidence of the project architects’ advice and the URA’s use restriction influenced its eventual determination that the SPA was not unlawful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 But the point remains the tribunal did not breach the hearsay rule in receiving that evidence. The plaintiff was therefore not improperly deprived of the chance to cross-examine the project architects. Indeed, the tribunal was clear in paragraph 78 that it was not necessary for it to determine the correctness of the architects’ advice:

On the contrary, the tribunal declined to assess the “true meaning” of the project architects’ advice (see also [78] above). It merely relied on the defendant’s evidence of that advice to establish that the defendant had in fact been advised by the architects in those terms and honestly believed the advice to be correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In sum, there is no breach of the rules of natural justice that warrants setting aside the award. The plaintiff was not denied a fair hearing. First, it had reasonable notice of the case that it had to meet. Second, there is clearly no failure of natural justice in the plaintiff’s lack of an opportunity to cross-examine the project architects’ representatives on the content of their advice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third ground: Award being contrary to public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Law on public policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The third and final ground which the plaintiff says justifies setting aside the award is that the award is contrary to public policy. To this end, it relies on s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">b)</span>(ii) of the Arbitration Act. Both parties’ submissions on the scope of this ground rely on a number of cases on Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. I accept that they are of persuasive value in considering the scope of s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii). That provision is similar, although not identical, to its analogue in the Model Law (see [97] below). A number of propositions as to when a court should set aside a domestic award for being contrary to public policy can hence be distilled from those cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, the court is empowered to decide for itself what the public policy of Singapore is. It is not constrained to defer to the tribunal’s decision on that issue. The issue of contractual illegality under Singapore law is one aspect of Singapore’s public policy. Thus, for example, where the court differs from the tribunal on the principles of law to be applied in order to determine whether a contract is vitiated by illegality under Singapore law, it is within the court’s supervisory power to set aside the award. So too, the court may set an award aside if the tribunal has ignored “palpable and indisputable illegality”. But setting aside is not legitimate where the court and the tribunal disagree not on the principles of law which ought to be applied but on the underlying facts to which those principles should be applied. If that is the case, the court must defer to the tribunal (<span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT </span>[2011] 4 SLR 739 at [62]–[64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, the party who wishes to set aside an award on the ground that it is contrary to public policy must establish two things. It must first identify the rule or principle of public policy to which the award is allegedly contrary. It must then ascertain the part of the award conflicting with that public policy (<span class="font-italic">VV</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v VW </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 929 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Third, an award will be set aside for being contrary to public policy only if it offends “fundamental notions and principles of justice”: <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide </span>(Sundaresh Menon CJ &amp; Denis Brock eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2014) at paras 14.055–14.057. This is a narrow conception which will not be satisfied unless upholding the award (i) would “shock the conscience”; (ii) is “clearly injurious to the public good” or “wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public; or (iii) would violate the “most basic notion of morality and justice” (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 That plaintiff submits that “public policy” in s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Arbitration Act sets a lower threshold for setting aside on this ground in a domestic arbitration than the threshold set by Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law in international arbitrations.

</div> That is said to be because the Arbitration Act enables the court to set aside a domestic arbitration award on the <span class="font-italic">domestic</span> standard of public policy which is wider than the narrow, international standard of public policy which the Model Law applies to an international arbitration. It is not necessary for me to determine in this case whether the plaintiff’s argument is correct.

</div> Second, the tribunal’s finding that the URA’s use restriction was open to interpretation and did not require the defendant to limit the use of the facilities to customers of the business is “injurious to the public good” and “violates in a fundamental way notions of both morality and justice”.

I have already rejected this argument under the natural justice head.  I can reject it again swiftly under the public policy head.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As a start, it is unclear why admitting and relying on hearsay evidence amounts to a breach of public policy. There is nothing in the public policy of Singapore which requires a tribunal to exclude hearsay evidence in finally determining a party’s rights and obligations in a civil claim. There is, of course, a rule of evidence in Singapore that, in a trial in open court, facts must be proved by direct evidence as defined in s 62 of the Evidence Act. But that is a rule of evidence not of public policy. And that rule of evidence is any event subject to exceptions. Further, the courts routinely act on hearsay evidence in determining with finality the parties rights and obligations in chambers, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> on a summary judgment application, on a striking out application or on an originating summons. Finally, Parliament has specifically legislated s 2(2) of the Evidence Act that Singapore’s domestic rules of evidence, which includes s 62 of the Evidence Act, shall not apply to proceedings before an arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In any case, as I have found at [78]–[91] above, the tribunal neither admitted nor relied on hearsay evidence in reaching its decision. It bears re-emphasising that evidence of the project architects’ advice to the defendant was admitted and relied upon to prove the fact that the architects advised the defendant on URA’s policy and use restriction, not to prove that the architects’ advice was correct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">URA’s policy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 With respect to the second argument, I agree with the defendant that a reading of the tribunal’s award makes it apparent that it did not make any findings as to the effect of the URA’s policy and use restriction.

</div> The tribunal’s findings on this issue centred on only two questions: first, how <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span><span class="font-italic"> subjectively understood </span>the URA’s policy and use restriction in light of the professional advice it had received from the project architects; and second, whether a reasonable person would have understood the advice in the same way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 And as examined above at [69], it was necessary for the tribunal to do so in order to determine whether the defendant was guilty of making fraudulent misrepresentations. In my view, the tribunal did not make any findings on what the URA’s policy and use restriction <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> allowed the defendant to do. This is made clear in the following passage from paragraph 78 of the tribunal’s award (see also [90] above):

The plaintiff argues that the tribunal erred in giving effect to the SPA, which it claims is tainted by illegality. The plaintiff argues that the SPA is illegal because it is an agreement for an illegal purpose. More specifically, the submission is that the SPA involved the sale of a business that is prohibited under the URA’s use restriction, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a business in which the facilities are open to members of the public.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In my judgment, there is no merit in the plaintiff’s submissions. I begin by setting out the law on illegality briefly. There are broadly two types of illegality that can vitiate a contract: statutory illegality and illegality at common law (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 13.003). The first step in every analysis involving illegality is to identify the alleged illegality (<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May v Boon Lay </span><span class="font-italic">Choo and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 609<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [79]). A contract is not necessarily void and unenforceable simply because it was entered into for an illegal purpose, such as where the parties intended to contravene a statutory provision. As held in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]–[71], the court has to calibrate a proportionate response to the illegality in each case by assessing factors such as the gravity of the illegality and the parties’ intentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In this case, the illegality alleged is statutory in nature. The plaintiff alleges that the SPA contravenes the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed) because it was being operated in breach of the URA’s use restriction.

The effect of the SPA was to sell the business and the leasehold interest in the premises from which it was being operated to the plaintiff.

</div> There is certainly nothing to suggest that the parties entered into the SPA for the purpose of contravening the URA’s use restriction. There is also nothing in the SPA which obliges the plaintiff to continue to operate the business as the defendant did if the plaintiff truly believes that doing so is in breach of the URA’s use restriction. It is therefore difficult to see any basis for the plaintiff’s submission that the SPA is tainted by illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The plaintiff’s inability to demonstrate any illegality is therefore the end of the inquiry.

</div> In fact, the tribunal went so far as to suggest that there might be no breach at all at paragraph 78[viii] of the award where it noted that the URA had taken no action against the defendant during the period when the plaintiff alleged that the business was being operated in breach of the use restriction:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The tribunal] notes that the [business] has in fact been operated, by both Parties, in accordance with that advice since it opened in November 2013 and that that has <span class="font-italic">given to no difficulties with the URA</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For these reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the SPA was a contract that the parties entered into with the object of committing an illegal act.

As noted at [4] above, the tribunal delivered its award in June 2016. In October 2016, the plaintiff initiated an action against the defendant. While the focus of the arbitration (and therefore the award) was on the SPA, the focus of the plaintiff’s action is on the <span class="font-italic">lease </span>for the business which the defendant granted to the plaintiff pursuant to the SPA.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 On the “abuse of process” ground, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [22] that the term “abuse of process” imports considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. The court will not allow itself to be abused by litigants seeking to use the judicial apparatus to vex and oppress other parties. In this regard, it has been observed that the court will strike out an action under this limb if it involves re-litigating matters or litigating matters which ought to have been raised in earlier proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017 </span>vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) at para 18/19/15. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Both grounds on which the defendant relies in its striking out application therefore rest on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. To that doctrine I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>has been comprehensively discussed and set out in a number of decisions (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 and <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453). It therefore suffices for present purposes to set out only the essential principles. The term “<span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>comprises three principles, namely, (a) cause of action estoppel; (b) issue estoppel; and (c) the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or the abuse of process doctrine (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [98]). These principles are underscored by the public policy consideration that there should be finality in litigation and that parties should not be unduly harassed or multiply vexed in the same matter. But while they share the same underlying purpose, they are distinct principles which operate differently (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cause of action estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Cause of action estoppel operates to prevent a party from asserting or denying against another party the existence of a cause of action, when its existence or non-existence has previously been decided in proceedings between the same parties by a court of competent jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [99] citing <span class="font-italic">Thoday</span><span class="font-italic"> v Thoday </span>[1964] P 181 at 197). In <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi v Koh Kim Seng and another </span>[2015] SGHC 175 at [40], George Wei J distilled the elements of cause of action estoppel as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, there must be identity of parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, there must be identity of <span class="font-italic">causes of action</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the earlier judgment must have been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, the judgment must be final and conclusive on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Issue estoppel precludes a party from re-litigation an issue rather than a cause of action. Issue estoppel applies when a litigant raises a question of fact or law which has already been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [100]). The elements to be satisfied for a party to raise issue estoppel successfully are set out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 875 at [14]. These elements mirror closely the elements for cause of action estoppel and can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, there must be identity of parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, there must be identity of <span class="font-italic">subject matter</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the earlier judgment must have been pronounced by a competent court; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, the judgment must be final and conclusive on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 At this juncture, I pause to note that issue estoppel overlaps with cause of action estoppel, although the former is of wider application (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [100]; <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [41]). Certainly, it is evident from the above that the two estoppels are similar in that they operate when a party attempts to raise a point that has been determined by a competent court (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Extended doctrine of res judicata or abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel are quite distinct from the abuse of process doctrine. It is the doctrine of abuse of process which operates to bar a litigant from litigating matters even though those matters <span class="font-italic">have not</span> before been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. As Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [41], the two estoppels and their overlapping areas of application are less applicable when the court is confronted with an issue which has not been previously litigated. The focus then shifts to the abuse of process doctrine and whether the party now raising that issue <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to have raised it in prior proceedings (at [41]):<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As one moves further away from what was directly covered by the earlier decision, then the relevant doctrine becomes the defence of abuse of process rather than issue estoppel. Thus where the issue ought to have been raised and was not, it might nonetheless amount to an abuse of process subsequently to litigate that same issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Accordingly, the abuse of process doctrine has wider application than both cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. To ascertain whether the abuse of process doctrine is engaged, the court must examine the circumstances of the case to determine whether the matter which the plaintiff seeks to litigate now could reasonably have been raised in the earlier proceedings (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [104]). Ultimately, the law must strike a balance between ensuring that a the defendant is not unduly harassed by repeated litigation and allowing a plaintiff to pursue a genuine claim. To do this, the court considers the following factors, which are neither exhaustive nor determinative (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the later proceedings in substance are nothing more than a collateral attack upon the decision in the earlier proceedings;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the fresh proceedings to continue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analytical approach to the doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 From the above, it can be seen that cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel find application in significantly different situations from the abuse of process doctrine. In <span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [105], the Court of Appeal described the analytical approach to be applied when a defendant argues that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>prevents a plaintiff from bringing a claim or raising an argument. First, the court must determine whether the matter has been previously decided by a competent court in proceedings between the same parties. If so, then one or perhaps both of the estoppels are triggered. Second, if not, the question is whether the matter could reasonably have been raised in the earlier proceedings. If it could have been, then the abuse of process doctrine operates to prevent the plaintiff from raising it in the fresh proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff’s action ought to be struck out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The plaintiff makes the preliminary point that the SPA and the lease are wholly independent agreements.

</div> Nevertheless, it maintains that the two agreements are in truth independent for a number of reasons. First, the SPA involved the transfer of a number of assets such as inventory and goodwill of the business. The lease is only one of the assets to be transferred under the SPA, and the two agreements thus cannot be treated as the same.

</div> From this argument, the plaintiff invites me to conclude that the arbitration (which dealt only with the SPA) is wholly distinct from this action (which deals only with the lease).

It is therefore no longer open to the plaintiff to litigate these two representations again, even in the context of the lease.

By that time, and by virtue of the SPA, the defendant was already contractually bound to enter into the lease. That is something the plaintiff itself acknowledges (see [130] above). It therefore cannot be said that the plaintiff was induced by the representation to enter into the lease. It is therefore legally unsustainable for the plaintiff to contend now that it was the third representation which, in any legal sense, induced it to enter into the lease.

In my judgment, it is an abuse of process for the plaintiff to bring these claims, which are in any event misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I begin by setting out the basis of both claims.

</div> Given the importance of cl 4 to the plaintiff’s claim, I set out the relevant portion of the clause in full here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Prescribed Business</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Lessee covenants to the Lessor to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) not conduct or permit to be conducted any business or operations in, or otherwise use for any<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>purpose, the Demised Premises, except as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) during the Commitment Period, the Lessee will conduct a [business] on the whole of the Demised Premises which is either:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A) operated by the Initial … Operator pursuant to the Initial … Agreements; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(B) in the event that the Initial … Agreements have been terminated by the Lessee in accordance with their terms, operated by the Lessee or a … Operator (not being the Initial … Operator) in a manner and of a quality and standard that is at least commensurate with the market positioning of the business conducted by the Lessor on the Servient Tenement; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) during the remainder of the Term after expiry of the Commitment Period, the Lessee will conduct a business on the whole of the Demised Premises,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(subparagraphs (i) and (ii) together, “<span class="font-weight-bold">Prescribed Business</span>”);</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The plaintiff’s case is that the operator provided a budget pursuant to the “Initial … Agreements” mentioned in cl 4(a)(i)(A) of the lease, and that the budget included income obtained from the facilities being used by members of the public.

</div> Presumably, this led the plaintiff to believe that the facilities could be used by members of the public. But the plaintiff argues that, because such use of the facilities would be in breach of the URA’s use restriction, the business is “materially less fit” for the use contemplated by the lease.

Before the tribunal, the plaintiff sought to argue that cl 3.1 of the SPA contemplated the sale of a business without any restrictions as to who can use the facilities.

</div>
</div> And it is evident that the plaintiff’s claims for breach of the covenants of quiet enjoyment and derogation of grant are merely re-characterisations of the arguments that it placed before the tribunal in the arbitration, and which the tribunal rejected. This is especially in the light of my finding that the SPA and the lease are not distinct agreements, but are part of a single transaction with the lease being subsidiary to the SPA. The plaintiff’s claims thus constitute a collateral attack on the tribunal’s findings. The doctrine of abuse of process (in the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> sense) is squarely engaged. As Menon JC notes in <span class="font-italic">Nellie Goh </span>at [21], the abuse of process doctrine is to prevent a situation where litigants attempt to re-litigate an issue that has been decided by re-characterising it. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s action ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC as an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In any case, it is clear that the plaintiff’s claims are legally misconceived. It is trite that the covenants for quiet enjoyment and non-derogation from grant operate <span class="font-italic">prospectively</span>. They are therefore inapplicable to acts which occurred <span class="font-italic">before</span> the lease is granted or, in the case of continuing acts, which started before the lease is granted (<span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd v Three Sixty Degree Pte Ltd and another suit </span>[2013] 3 SLR 1 at [73]). Here, the plaintiff’s claims are premised on the inability to let members of the public use the facilities. That restriction was in place before the defendant granted the plaintiff the lease. The plaintiff’s claims under this head are therefore legally unsustainable and ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the striking out application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 For the reasons above, I strike out the plaintiff’s action entirely under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. In my view, the plaintiff’s claims are essentially the same as the claims that it placed before the tribunal. It is therefore prevented by the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> from litigating them again. In any case, it is clear that its claims are legally unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 To recapitulate, the plaintiff’s setting aside application is dismissed. None of the grounds under s 48 of the Arbitration Act that the plaintiff claims to justify the setting aside of the award are applicable in this case. The tribunal neither exceeded its jurisdiction by deciding issues that were not before it nor did it deny the plaintiff a fair hearing. The SPA is also not tainted by illegality and the award is not contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The defendant’s striking out application is allowed. I strike out the plaintiff’s action. In my judgment, the action is barred by the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and constitutes an abuse of process under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC. The plaintiff’s claims for breach of the lease are also legally unsustainable and ought to be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 As for costs, the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant the costs of and incidental to the applications. The costs of the setting aside application is fixed at $50,000 including disbursements. With regard to the striking out application, the plaintiff is to pay to the defendant the costs of and incidental to the application and the costs of and incidental to the remainder of the action. Such costs are fixed at $21,000 excluding disbursements, which are to be taxed if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vinodh Coomaraswamy <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Peter Gabriel, Kevin Au and Charmaine Jin (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the plaintiff in both applications;<br/>Philip Jeyaretnam SC, Ajinderpal Singh, Joel Yeow and Kayleigh Wee (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendant in both applications.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
