These orders in HC/ORC 50/2019 (“ORC 50/2019”) pertained to the plaintiff’s obligation to disclose certain documents to the defendant, Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani, in fulfilment of his obligation as trustee to give an account of the trust property to the defendant as beneficiary of the trust under the last will and testament (“the Will”) of the late Harkishindas Ghumanmal Bhojwani (“the Testator”). As the parties have taken on different roles in various legal proceedings, and with the parties’ consent, I will refer to the plaintiff as the “Husband”, and the defendant as the “Wife”, although interim judgment has already been given in separate divorce proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The basis of the Husband’s application in OS 1339/2019 was two sets of deeds that he had executed after the Court of Appeal made its decision in the appeal from OS 1407/2017 in CA/CA 231/2018 (“CA 231/2018”). On 3 October 2019, the Husband executed a “Deed of Advancement”. On 10 January 2020, he further executed a “Deed” and a “Deed of Appointment”. The Husband argued that by either of these sets of deeds, he had excluded the Wife as a beneficiary of the trust and was no longer liable to give an account to her. He also made further arguments relating to the Wife’s alleged conduct, which I will detail below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I granted the Husband’s application in part, ordering the Husband to provide an account of the trust property by furnishing the documents set out in the document “P1” annexed to ORC 50/2019, but only for the period for which the Wife was a beneficiary, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, until 9 January 2020, the day before the Deed and Deed of Appointment were executed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1 We affirm the trial Judge’s decision on the ground that the appellant had not exercised his absolute discretion to exclude the respondent from further trust assets ‘by deed or deeds’, as required under cl 5.2 of the will of the late Harkishindas G Bhojwani dated 20 October 2006. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2 The testator’s conferment of absolute discretion on his 3 sons in the will makes sense because the testator was in fact entrusting all his properties to his 3 sons and giving his 3 sons absolute discretion and control over how they would distribute and manage the assets for each of their families. The divorce proceedings in 2017 between the appellant and the respondent could not have been in contemplation when the will was made in 2006. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 The facts here are not about the respondent being excluded as a beneficiary – she was made a beneficiary of the entire value of the trust property in 32 Branksome Road, which we understand is worth more than $6m. The appellant says that he has decided that only the house will go to the respondent and all the other assets will go to their 3 sons although he has not decided in what proportions. The problem is that the appellant did not go by the route of a ‘deed or deeds’. We disagree with the appellant’s assertion that ‘deed’ merely means an act rather than a formal legal document. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 It is clear that the appellant had not exercised his discretion in the manner asserted by him – that the house goes to the wife and nothing else – because the transfer was almost fortuitous. He asked Mr Moti to do the transfer after the 3 sons agreed to transfer the house to the respondent. Therefore, the appellant had not purported to exercise any discretion under cl 5.2 at all. On this basis, the respondent remains a beneficiary to the rest of the trust property and is therefore entitled to ask for an account of that trust property at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5 We affirm the trial Judge’s orders on the range of documents.

The Husband also alleged that the solicitors, having been given the data, retained and used it in the divorce proceedings when they knew or ought to have known of the private and confidential nature of the data <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Husband.

In support of this application, Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep filed affidavits, which the Husband argued in the present proceedings contained admissions that the documents that they had taken from the Husband included documents that related to the Clause 5 and Clause 7(b) Trusts for which he was ordered to give an account in ORC 50/2019.

This would have rendered the order to give an account oppressive to the Husband and unnecessary, and, further, meant that OS 1407/2017 had been brought in abuse of process.

In relation to prayer 3, the Husband raised the additional point that some of the companies, namely Shankar’s Emporium Pte Ltd, Malaya Company Pte Ltd and Liberty Merchandising Company Pte Ltd (“the Live Companies”) objected to providing the documents to the Husband for the purpose of disclosure to the Wife.

</div> Second, the Wife argued that the Deed of Advancement, the Deed, and the Deed of Appointment were all invalid and defective. Hence, she remained a beneficiary of the Trusts. Third, in any event, the said deeds could not operate retrospectively to deprive her of the account of the Trusts that she was entitled to for the period in which she remained a beneficiary. That is, her alternative position was that even if she had been removed as a beneficiary, her entitlement to the account remained until the date of her removal.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I note here that while the Clause 5 Trust and the Clause 7(b) Trust are distinct trusts under the Will, the parties focused their arguments on the Clause 5 Trust and the deeds executed by the Husband in October 2019 and January 2020 only made reference to cll 5.1 and 5.2 of the Will. Therefore, I considered this case on the footing of the arguments surrounding the Clause 5 Trust, but recognised that in the absence of any arguments specific to the Clause 7(b) Trust, my conclusion would affect the Trusts as a whole, subject to the effect of the deeds as circumscribed by their scopes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It was not disputed by the parties that if the Wife remained a beneficiary of the Trusts, she would be entitled to an account and, hence, the documents under ORC 50/2019. This was the result of OS 1407/2017 as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in CA 231/2018. The central question in this case centred on how the court should deal with the changed circumstances arising from: (a) the Deed of Advancement dated 3 October 2019, or the Deed and Deed of Appointment both dated 10 January 2020; and/or (b) the evidence relating to the Wife’s alleged possession of the documents relating to the Trusts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I deal with the issues raised in the following sequence, noting that the resolution of the first issue may be dispositive of some of the remaining issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What parts of the Husband’s application should not be considered by reason of the principle of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the Wife’s entitlement to the account and documents affected by:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Deed of Advancement, the Deed, and/or the Deed of Appointment?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the new evidence that suggested that Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep had obtained documents which included documents sought and ordered to be produced in OS 1407/2017?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Should the scope of the documents be varied for the above reasons, and/or because the Live Companies have raised issues about providing such documents to the Husband?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> consists of three “conceptually distinct but interrelated principles”: (a) cause of action estoppel; (b) issue estoppel; and (c) the “extended doctrine” of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, or the defence of “abuse of process”: <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal and other matters</span> [2017] 2 SLR 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span>”) at [82]. Cause of action estoppel was not argued by the Wife in the present case, and, in any case, I did not think that the present proceedings were based on the same cause of action as in OS 1407/2017. Therefore, I deal only with issue estoppel and abuse of process in this section.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Court of Appeal identified four conditions for issue estoppel to apply (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> at [87]). First, there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits. Second, the judgment must be by a court of competent jurisdiction. Third, the two actions that are being compared must involve the same parties. Fourth, there must be identity of subject matter in the two proceedings. In the present case, the first, second, and third conditions were met. The only issue was whether there was an identity of subject matter in OS 1407/2017 (and CA 231/2018) and OS 1339/2019. As the Court of Appeal summarised in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [108], there are three further sub-requirements under the fourth condition: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The prior decision must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceedings and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision <span class="font-italic">must not have changed or should be incapable of change</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The previous determination must have been fundamental and not merely collateral to the previous decision so that the decision could not stand without that determination, and this analysis should be approached from the perspective of common sense. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The issue should be shown in fact to have been raised and argued. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Husband raised two facts in the present case which he claimed constitute a change in the circumstances in relation to the Wife’s entitlement to the account. First, he had executed the Deed of Advancement in October 2019 and the Deed and Deed of Appointment in January 2020. In my view, this was a change in the facts and circumstances that rendered the subject matter of the present proceedings different from that of OS 1407/2017 and CA 231/2018. The Wife was correct to submit that the question of whether the Husband <span class="font-italic">had </span>verbally determined her interest in the Trusts was <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, since that was the very heart of this court’s and the Court of Appeal’s findings in the prior proceedings. However, that was a different question from whether, in October 2019 or January 2020, the deeds were sufficient to determine the Wife’s interest in the Clause 5 Trust, <span class="font-italic">such that</span> the Wife was no longer entitled to the account ordered in ORC 50/2019. The Husband’s application in OS 1339/2019 was based on facts that could not have existed when OS 1407/2017 and CA 231/2018 were being considered. Whether he was correct or wrong about the effect of the deeds, that was a matter that had not yet been adjudicated. In this sense, the mere fact that the Husband’s argument, if correct, could result in the deeds having some form of retrospective effect did not mean that the subject matters of the two sets of proceedings were the same.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38     Second, the Husband raised the issue of the new evidence that Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep had allegedly taken the documents that the Wife sought in OS 1407/2017. The issues of whether the Wife already had access to the documents sought, and of whether this would amount to a reason against granting the order to account or a basis for claiming that OS 1407/2017 was brought in abuse of process, were not raised or considered in the prior substantive proceedings. Therefore, there was no identity of subject matter. Accordingly, the question of whether these issues <span class="font-italic">should</span> have been raised in the prior proceedings is a matter to be dealt with under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Turning then to the scope of the documents, apart from the above two arguments, the Husband also raised the argument that the Live Companies, whose shares were included in the Clause 5 Shares, were not willing to disclose the documents to him for the purpose of furnishing them to the Wife. I found that issue estoppel applied to this issue. The issue of the scope of the documents to be disclosed was litigated in OS 1407/2017 and in CA 231/2018. As part of his argument that the scope of ORC 50/2019 was too broad, the Husband had contended that the documents within the Live Companies’ possession were not in his power and control.

[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal went on to reject the Husband’s contentions and affirmed the High Court’s order on the scope of the documents.

First, in the present case, there did not appear to be any new arguments which went specifically to this point. The various arguments raised as to the scope of the documents to be furnished were essentially the same as those relating to the Wife’s entitlement to an account, or were directed to the documents relating to the Live Companies. However, none of these arguments showed why the proposed variation in prayer 3(a) of OS 1339/2019 should now be adopted. Second, the issue of whether the documents relating to the Sons should be disclosed was heavily contested in the prior proceedings. It was an argument that the Husband had raised on appeal in CA 231/2018, claiming that the Wife was only entitled to the documents that pertained to <span class="font-italic">her</span> interest, and that the Wife had no standing to seek the documents relating to the other beneficiaries, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Sons.

</div>
</div>
</div> Third, in the light of those arguments, the Court of Appeal then made a clear decision on this issue in affirming the High Court’s orders on the range of documents. In my view, there was clearly an identity of subject matter, and the facts relating to this particular prayer were not shown to have changed. I therefore found that issue estoppel applied to prevent the Husband from seeking a modification of the order relating to documents which he claimed touched on the Sons’ interests. Hence, the arguments surrounding the proposed variations in prayers 3(a) and 3(b) of OS 1339/2019 were barred by issue estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Extended doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Beyond issue estoppel, I also considered whether raising these arguments would constitute an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. As the High Court stated in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] court should determine whether there is an abuse of process by looking at all the circumstances of the case, <span class="font-italic">including whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision</span>; whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation; whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence or existence of these enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not decisive. In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, <span class="font-italic">the court</span> should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but <span class="font-italic">should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a </span><span class="font-italic">genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In respect of the Husband’s claim that the deeds executed in October 2019 or January 2020 had changed the Wife’s position, I did not find that there was an abuse of process, since those facts clearly arose after the prior proceedings. The fact that he was trying to achieve what he had failed to do before was not sufficient reason to conclude that there was an abuse of process, given that there was no rule prohibiting the Husband from executing the deeds in October 2019 or January 2020. Whether the deeds had the effect intended was, as I have already noted, a separate question from whether the present proceedings should be considered by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  I had more difficulty with the Husband’s arguments concerning the allegations that Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep had taken his data and documents, and that the Wife thereby already had the documents that she then sought in OS 1407/2017. The issue here is that the underlying facts had already occurred before OS 1407/2017 was decided. On the Husband’s own arguments, Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep had taken the data and documents from his personal laptop sometime in 2015–2016.

Yet, the Husband did not raise this issue in the substantive arguments. Given that the Husband had such a belief before the appeal was heard, the proper course of action would have been to seek leave to adduce further evidence at that the appeal. While I recognise that the affidavits that the Husband was now relying upon were filed in December 2019, <span class="font-italic">after</span> the appeal was heard, the fact remained that he had already formed his belief as to the Wife’s dealings with the documents (which had to be based on <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence if he was willing to state this belief on affidavit), yet failed to raise any issue in the prior proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, on the Husband’s evidence, it was not clear that he was unable to raise the issue even at the first instance in OS 1407/2017. In that regard, the Husband’s affidavits in the present proceedings did not show any reason why he would not have been able to uncover further evidence that the Wife, through Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep, had obtained the documents from his laptop. I note that based on the Husband’s pleadings in S 1242/2019, the Wife had used information from his laptop as early as August <span class="font-italic">2018</span>, even before OS 1407/2017 was determined.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The argument raised by the Husband was, in substance, a collateral attack on the prior decision. The argument effectively asked the court to re-exercise the discretion as to whether the order to account should be granted. As the Husband couched his argument in the present proceedings, in the words of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Moti</span> ([10] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [44]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [N]otwithstanding a beneficiary’s entitlement to an account from his trustee, the court may in its discretion decline to make an order for the taking of accounts if it would be oppressive for the trustee to so account, or if there was some other good reason to so decline …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He had relied on the same principle in OS 1407/2017 and CA 231/2018, meaning that this question was part of the process by which the previous courts had arrived at their decisions. Yet, the Husband had failed to raise this particular issue as an argument against granting the account to the Wife, which he now argued justified a different result on the same principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Further, on the facts, I did not think that the Husband had sufficiently shown that he was truly unable to have raised this issue in the prior proceedings, and certainly, on his own admission in his affidavit for CA/SUM 92/2019, he already believed that the Wife had those documents before the hearing of the appeal. I could not find any <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reason for why the issue was not raised in the earlier proceedings. To allow the Husband to raise this issue in the present proceedings would effectively allow an unsatisfied litigant to re-open a case on the basis that “better” evidence of something that he already believed (but failed to raise) had arisen after the determination of the matter. The interest in finality of litigation and fairness to the Wife strongly supported my finding that this argument was an abuse of process under the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. In any case, I did not consider it unjust to prevent the Husband from raising the issues in this context – if the allegations are true, the Husband has rights against the Wife, Mr Devin, and Mr Sandeep, which can be enforced in S 1242/2019. I therefore conclude that the Husband could not raise this issue in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Scope of the liberty to apply to the High Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As a final preliminary matter, I deal with the arguments concerning the Court of Appeal’s statement in its judgment that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If there are difficulties encountered by the appellant in complying with the orders, he can go back before the trial Judge to modify the orders or to ask for further directions as may be necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Husband appeared to rely on this to argue that he had liberty to seek significant modifications to ORC 50/2019, including as to the Wife’s entitlement to the account and the scope of the documents to be furnished. However, the key context for this sentence was the preceding one, which reads, “We affirm the trial Judge’s orders on the range of documents.” In that context, the Court of Appeal’s statement that the Husband could “go back before” the High Court should be understood to be concerned only with the implementation and enforcement of ORC 50/2019, rather than as a blanket allowance to revisit even the Wife’s entitlement to the account and documents. Specifically, I did not consider that this would, on its own, have otherwise enabled the Husband to apply for (a) a declaration that ORC 50/2019 was inoperative; and (b) that the entitlement to account ceased in October 2019 or January 2020. There was some scope for an application to modify the scope of the documents, but that had to be considered in the light of any difficulty that the Husband faced in compliance, not generally in terms of the Wife’s entitlement to the documents. Further, a variation would still be in the discretion of this court, since the Court of Appeal did not pre-determine that any variation application would necessarily succeed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Entitlement to account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I turn then to the substance of the dispute in the present case. Having found that the Husband could raise the issue of how the deeds he executed in October 2019 and January 2020 affected the Wife’s entitlement to an account, I first consider the effect of the various deeds on the Wife’s interest under the Trusts, before dealing with how that, in turn, affected (or did not affect) the Wife’s entitlement to an account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Before addressing the specific deeds, I summarise the position of the Clause 5 Trust as it stood after the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 231/2018. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Clause 5 Trust was a discretionary trust which gave the Husband the <span class="font-italic">absolute</span> <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> to decide how to appoint the property under the said trusts to the class of beneficiaries defined under the cl 5.1(ii) of the Will: CA 231/2018 Judgment at para 2. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The transfer of the Branksome Property to the Wife in 2016 was not, in and of itself, sufficient to determine her interest in the Clause 5 Trust, because the Husband had not exercised his discretion by way of a deed or deeds as required by cl 5.2 of the Will: CA 231/2018 Judgment at para 4. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect of the Deed of Advancement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my judgment, the Deed of Advancement dated 3 October 2019 was not effective, under cl 5.2 of the Will, to determine the Wife’s interest in the Clause 5 Trust. This is because the Deed of Advancement described itself as for “advancement”, while cl 5.2 of the Will provided for the discretion to “appoint”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There is a distinction between the power of advancement and the power of appointment. As counsel for the Wife rightly pointed out, this distinction is an important one in the law of trusts. The power to appoint creates a beneficial interest in favour of one or more objects of the power:<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lynton Tucker, Nicholas Le Poidevin &amp; James Brightwell, <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewin</span>”) at para 30-002.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The power of advancement, rather, allows the trustee to “anticipate the vesting in possession of an intended beneficiary’s contingent or reversionary interest”: <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> at para 32-001 – in other words, it is concerned less with who is to benefit, but more with when that beneficiary will receive the benefit from the trust. I found the distinction helpfully summarised by the New Zealand Supreme Court of Wellington in <span class="font-italic">Kain v Hutton</span> [2008] 3 NZLR 589 (“<span class="font-italic">Kain</span>”) at [32] and [33]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 … A power of appointment amongst discretionary objects (a special power) is a power to select whether and to what extent and at what time one or more of the discretionary objects will receive any part of the trust fund, perhaps with the result that other discretionary objects will miss out entirely. It is often under a modern trust deed the most significant or fundamental power which the trustees have at their disposal. In contrast, a power of advancement is a purely ancillary power enabling the trustees to anticipate, by means of an advance under it, the date of actual enjoyment by a beneficiary, and it can only affect the destination of the trust fund indirectly in the event of the beneficiary failing to attain a vested interest. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 The decision to be made on an <span class="font-italic">advancement</span> is, therefore, of a different character from a decision on an appointment: not whether the selected object is to benefit at all, but whether that person should receive his or her entitlement at an earlier time and possibly in a different manner and perhaps to the disadvantage of someone else who already has an interest in the fund. In the case of an <span class="font-italic">appointment</span> among discretionary objects, the other objects in that class ordinarily are not being deprived of anything more than their mere hope of an exercise of discretion in their favour. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 While the Deed of Advancement purported to be an exercise of the discretion under cl 5.2 of the Will, it was also referred to as a deed of <span class="font-italic">advancement.</span> The significant difference between an advancement and an appointment rendered it unsafe, in my view, to rely on the Deed of Advancement as an exercise of the power of appointment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect of the Deed and Deed of Appointment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I turn, then, to the remaining deeds. I found that the Deed and Deed of Appointment were effective to determine the Wife’s interest under the Clause 5 Trust. The Deed and the Deed of Appointment worked together to achieve this in a two-fold manner. First, the Deed irrevocably declared and determined that the Branksome Property was allocated and distributed to the Wife from the trust free from any and all encumbrances, and stated that the Wife shall receive no further distribution from the remaining trust property, and that she has no interest in any of the said property.

First, she argued that the Deed was not valid or executed in accordance with cl 5.2 of the Will because it dealt with the Branksome Property, which had been transferred to the Wife more than three years before the Deed was executed. As such, the Husband could not purport to exercise a discretion in relation to a distribution that was already made.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I did not agree with the Wife’s first argument that the Deed could not purport to be the exercise of discretion in relation to property that was already distributed. I accepted that because legal title to the Branksome Property was transferred to the Wife in 2016, that property was no longer part of the Clause 5 Trust and the Husband could not claim to be a trustee of that property in January 2020. However, I did not see any reason why the Husband, having directed Mr Moti to transfer the legal title to the Branksome Property to the Wife in 2016, could not in January 2020 declare his intention that the transfer should also be <span class="font-italic">treated</span> as a distribution of that trust property to the Wife. I would not go so far as to say that this could <span class="font-italic">retrospectively</span> re-characterise the transfer in 2016 as an appointment from that date, since that would quite substantially limit the utility of the requirement that the discretion be exercised by “deed or deeds”. There must be some role for the formality to play and I found that the appointment could only take effect from the date of the deed in question. That said, there was nothing in my view preventing the Husband from declaring a past act as <span class="font-italic">also being</span> an appointment with effect from the date of that deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any case, I considered that the distribution of the Branksome Property to the Wife could be treated as a distinct question from whether the Wife could be excluded from the Clause 5 Trust prospectively by the Deed. In my judgment, the power of appointment under cl 5.2 of the Will gave the Husband the power to exclude the Wife from any future distribution of the trust property, regardless of whether this exclusion was accompanied by a distribution of the remainder of the trust property. I refer again to the wording of cl 5.2 of the Will as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I direct my trustee to hold the Trust Property upon trust for all <span class="font-italic">or such one or more of the beneficiaries</span> at such ages or times <span class="font-italic">in such shares and upon such trusts</span> for the benefit of <span class="font-italic">all or any one or more of the beneficiaries</span> as my trustee <span class="font-italic">in his absolute discretion</span> <span class="font-italic">may</span> by deed or deeds revocable or irrevocable at any time or times during the trust period <span class="font-italic">appoint</span> and in making any such appointment my trustee shall have powers specified in clause 3 above during the Trust Period. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the first line, there is express reference to the possibility that the trust may only be: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… for all or <span class="font-italic">such one or more</span> of the beneficiaries … in such shares and upon such trusts for the benefit of all <span class="font-italic">or any one or more of the beneficiaries </span>as [the Testator’s] trustee in his absolute discretion may by deed or deeds revocable or irrevocable at any time or times during the trust period appoint … [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">That is, the Husband as trustee has been given the discretion to determine <span class="font-italic">who</span> among the class of beneficiaries defined by cl 5.1(ii) would be beneficiaries of the trust over the trust property. There is no additional stipulation that this can only occur after property has been given to the beneficiary who is now being excluded, or that this must only be when all of the trust property is exhausted, as the Wife claimed. There is nothing in cl 5.2 of the Will that would enable the court to impose such a requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It is a matter of sound practice and logic that, if the trustee is given the power to appoint one or some other number of beneficiaries (within a class of beneficiaries) as beneficiaries of the trust, he is also given the power to <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> one or some other number of beneficiaries from the trust. One is the corollary of the other. It would be extremely artificial and, in my view, contrary to the language and intent of a clause like cl 5.2 of the Will to prevent the trustee from doing so. Hence, even if the declaration in the Deed concerning the Branksome Property could not be treated as an appointment in favour of the Wife, I found that the Husband had the power to exclude the Wife from the trust over the remaining property, and that this power was exercised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this case, I did not need to decide if this could have been effected by the Deed alone, in the absence of the Deed of Appointment. Given that both deeds existed together, I considered their cumulative effect. I found that by (a) expressly excluding the Wife from any further interest in the remaining trust property; and (b) appointing the Sons as beneficiaries of a trust over the remaining trust property, the deeds were sufficient to exclude the Wife as a beneficiary. The fact that the latter was a revocable appointment was adequately met by the fact that the former was irrevocable. The revocability of the appointment under the Deed of Appointment could then be understood as leaving open the possibility of further altering the appointments as between Mr Devin, Mr Dilip, and Mr Sandeep, but no longer with the Wife as a potential beneficiary of the trust property. By way of these deeds, and in exercise of the discretion under cl 5.2 of the Will, the Husband had excluded the Wife from the trust of the remaining property, and she was no longer a beneficiary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I was also not persuaded by the Wife’s argument that the deeds were invalid because the Husband could not bind his future exercise of discretion.

</div> This was not a case where the Husband had fettered his future exercise of the power, but rather, was one where the power itself had been exercised. The only question was the scope of the power, which was governed by cl 5.2 of the Will, not whether the Husband had bound himself to exercising his discretion in a particular way in the future. And as for the scope of the power, the very reference to an “irrevocable” appointment in cl 5.2 of the Will meant that the exercise of the power at one point could have a permanent effect on the beneficiaries’ entitlements for the remainder of the trust period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 While I based my decision primarily on the text of cl 5.2 of the Will, I was also confirmed in this understanding of the power of appointment by a number of cases that were not cited to me by parties. I set these cases out, however, as I considered them very helpful in dealing with the issues raised before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The most significant case is that of <span class="font-italic">Blausten v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [1972] 2 WLR 376 (“<span class="font-italic">Blausten</span>”), a decision of the English Court of Appeal. The dispute concerned the taxation of a settlement, whereby the taxpayer had directed that various investments and the sum of £100 be held on trust for a specified class. That specified class included (<span class="font-italic">Blausten</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 379D): (a) the “wife widow children and remoter issue of the settlor”; (b) the brothers and sisters of the settlor and their children and remoter issue; and (c) the “spouses widows and widowers of any of the children and remoter issue aforesaid”.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The trustee had applied to court to sanction a proposed draft deed, which purported to exercise the power of appointment under cl 2 of the trust deed. In effect, the proposed draft deed declared the same trusts as the trust deed, with the variation that the definition of “Beneficiaries” was modified to exclude the settlor himself: <span class="font-italic">Re New Huerto Trust</span> at [6]. The central question on appeal was (<span class="font-italic">Re New Huerto Trust</span> at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]hether a power of appointment in a trust deed authorising the trustee to appoint capital among named beneficiaries permits the trustee to exclude a named beneficiary from the objects of a discretionary trust, and to do so even in advance of appointing any capital to the other named beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 After considering the case of <span class="font-italic">Blausten</span>, among other authorities, the court held (<span class="font-italic">Re New Huerto Trust</span> at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the trustee can validly appoint property among two or more objects of the trust while excluding altogether one or more objects, then there is no reason why the trustee cannot, in advance of appointing any property to the objects of the trust, use the power of appointment to exclude one of them from benefiting under the trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I found both <span class="font-italic">Blausten</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re New Huerto</span><span class="font-italic"> Trust </span>persuasive. These authorities reinforced my decision to find that the Deed and Deed of Appointment were sufficient to exclude the Wife from any further interest in the Clause 5 Trust, although, as I have stated, my decision was based primarily on the interpretation of cl 5.2 of the Will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I summarise the above discussion. Since the Wife was not actually entirely excluded from the Clause 5 Trust, as she already received the Branksome Property and this, in my view, could be treated as an appointment from the date of the Deed onwards, this was simply a case of the power of appointment being exercised. <span class="font-italic">Blausten </span>([62] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Re New Huerto Trust </span>([66] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) confirmed this result. In fact, the present case is <span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-italic">fortiori</span> since the Wife was not merely being excluded from the trust, but had received property under the power of appointment. In any case, even if the transfer of the Branksome Property was not treated as an exercise of the power of appointment, these authorities also lead to the result that the Wife could be excluded from any interest in the Clause 5 Trust by an exercise of the power of appointment. For completeness, in this latter scenario, I note that s 23 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) may be relevant (see also <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> at para 30-025), but as parties have not addressed me on that provision, I say no more of it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Therefore, I found that the Deed and Deed of Appointment were sufficient to exclude the Wife as a beneficiary of the Clause 5 Trust, beginning from 10 January 2020 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consequences for the Wife’s entitlement to the account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I turn to the question of how this affected the Wife’s entitlement to an account. The Husband claimed that this meant that the Wife was no longer entitled to any account, even for the period when she remained a beneficiary. The Wife argued that she remained entitled to that account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I agreed with the Wife. As I have already found, the Wife ceased to be a beneficiary of the Clause 5 Trust only from 10 January 2020 onwards. The Deed and Deed of Appointment did not have a retrospective effect to “back-date” this exclusion to any earlier date. The Husband appeared to recognise that the Wife was still a beneficiary until 10 January 2020, as he argued that the Wife was <span class="font-italic">no longer </span>a beneficiary from that date.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  HWS at para 64.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Husband’s primary argument was that there had been a change in the “basis or substratum” on which ORC 50/2019 was made, and that because the Wife was <span class="font-italic">no longer</span> a beneficiary, she could not receive an account of the trust <span class="font-italic">for when she had been</span> a beneficiary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Husband relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Haw Par </span><span class="font-italic">Bros (Pte) Ltd v Dato Aw Kow </span>[1971–1973] SLR(R) 813 (“<span class="font-italic">Haw Par</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span>”) to support his argument that where the factual substratum of a prior court order had changed, the order could be rendered inoperative. I did not think the case stood for such a broad proposition. There, an inspection order had been previously made by the court under s 167(5) of the Companies Act (Cap 185, 1970 Rev Ed). The director in whose favour the order had been made was subsequently removed as a director. The question before the court was whether the order under s 167(5) continued to be in force after the director was removed from that office. That turned on the proper interpretation of the statutory provision. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that s 167(5) was intended to support the <span class="font-italic">director’s</span> right of inspection under s 167(3), and that the court therefore had no power to make an order requiring the company to open the records for inspection to an <span class="font-italic">ex-director</span>: <span class="font-italic">Haw Par</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span> at [13]. As for whether an order already made had continuing effect once the director was removed from office, the Court of Appeal also found that since the right of inspection under s 167(3) was limited to a present director, it followed that where an agent’s right to inspect was granted under s 167(5), once the principal was no longer a director, the right to inspect under s 167(5) also ceased: <span class="font-italic">Haw Par</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span> at [14]. Hence, it is clear that the Court of Appeal’s decision in that case had nothing to do with any <span class="font-italic">general</span> proposition that a prior order of court would <span class="font-italic">inevitably</span> be rendered inoperative because of a change in circumstances. The question was one of statutory interpretation and the scope of the court’s order under a particular provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The subsequent decision of <span class="font-italic">Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 770 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoban</span>”) at [43], approving of <span class="font-italic">Haw Par</span><span class="font-italic"> Bros</span>, did not establish such a general principle either. In that case, the judge had previously made an order in June 2004 directing the parties to appoint an expert to value the shares to facilitate an exit from the company. Importantly, the court order had used the word “purchase” and an option to purchase that was granted was held by the Court of Appeal to “imply that the parties and even the court thought that the subject shares had some value and that they should be subject to acquisition at that value”: <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span> at [40]. The Court of Appeal therefore found that when the valuation had found that the shares were of nil value, the order in June 2004 would not be implemented and had been rendered inoperative: <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span> at [42]. Once again, however, it bears noting that the decision turned on the interpretation of the court order and the effect of the nil valuation in the light of that interpretation. The decision does not stand for the broad proposition that any change in the factual substratum would result in the prior court order being rendered inoperative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 These two authorities appear to be founded on the scope of the court orders or authorising statutory provision, rather than on any discretion in the court to set aside a prior judgment or order. Turning to the latter, I acknowledged that the Court of Appeal has recently pronounced on the scope of the court’s inherent power to set aside a prior court order in <span class="font-italic">Harmonious Coretrades Pte Ltd v United Integrated Services Pte Ltd</span> [2020] 1 SLR 206 at [40]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We therefore agree with the Judge that the court retains the residual discretion to set aside a judgment or court order so as to prevent injustice. However, we emphasise that this is not a licence to litigants to make frivolous applications to set aside judgments or court orders. The court’s inherent power to set aside a judgment or court order should never become a back-door appeal or an opportunistic attempt to relitigate the merits of the case. One such situation where the court’s inherent power could be justifiably invoked might be where the substratum or the very foundation of a court order has been destroyed, such that the continued existence or future performance of the court order would lead to injustice. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear that the court must be astute to analyse the facts before it, and that not every change is a change in the factual substratum of the order, nor would a change always lead to an injustice that should be cured by an exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Regardless of whether the principles relating to the interpretation of the court’s order or the court’s inherent jurisdiction are relied upon, I was unable to agree with the Husband that ORC 50/2019 was rendered inoperative. There were two problems with the Husband’s argument. First, in reality, there was no change in the factual substratum of ORC 50/2019. The order had been made on the basis that the Wife was a beneficiary of the trust. That had not changed, until January 2020, but for the period before the deeds were executed she was still a beneficiary. The order was <span class="font-italic">not</span> predicated on her <span class="font-italic">continuing to be a beneficiary</span> indefinitely, but was predicated on the fact that she <span class="font-italic">was</span> a beneficiary at the material times and therefore, by that status, was entitled to the account. The fact that she was a beneficiary had not changed, since the exclusion was effected only on 10 January 2020. There was therefore no reason to suggest that ORC 50/2019 was inoperative for the period leading up to January 2020. Second, in any case, the law itself recognises that an ex-beneficiary would have an interest in holding the trustee to an account for the period for which she was a beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> at para 23-087). This is hence to be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Haw Par Bros</span> where the statutory right to inspect was limited to a director and not to an ex-director. The present case was also distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span> since ORC 50/2019 was still workable even if the Wife was no longer a beneficiary from a certain date onwards. For the same reasons, there was also no basis for exercising any inherent jurisdiction in setting aside the order on the ground of injustice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The highest, therefore, that the Husband’s case could go – which the Wife conceded in the event that the deeds in January 2020 were found to be effective

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Transcript (OS 1407/2019) for 11 July 2019 at p 113, ln 9–13 and p 118, ln 11–15: WA1 at pp 152 and 157.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> At the time of the hearing of OS 1339/2019 on 9 March 2020, SUM 3013/2019 was still pending determination, which would have addressed the Live Companies’ concerns in relation to providing the documents to the Husband for the purposes of the ORC 50/2019. I did not consider it appropriate for the Husband to pre-empt the results of that application by filing OS 1339/2019 to deal with the very same issue of the documents relating to the Live Companies. As between the two, SUM 3013/2019 was the more appropriate forum in which to determine these questions, since that would pertain to the enforcement of ORC 50/2019 and the Live Companies’ concerns, whereas OS 1339/2019 was heard without the benefit of the Live Companies’ presence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For completeness, I note that after judgment was given in these proceedings on 9 March 2020, the Live Companies also brought separate proceedings in HC/OS 365/2020 on 27 March 2020, which dealt with the same issues. In addition, leave was granted to withdraw SUM 3013/2019 on 9 April 2020. These developments have not affected anything decided in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, in any case, any difficulty that the Husband faced could easily be resolved without variation or modification of ORC 50/2019. There was a difference between the Wife’s <span class="font-italic">entitlement</span> to the documents and the implementation of ORC 50/2019 by the Husband. The issue relating to the Live Companies dealt only with the latter. The Husband could simply have stated on affidavit that he was unable to obtain the documents in question, and it would be for the Wife to follow up with any necessary action. Varying the court order was inappropriate since it suggested that the Wife was no longer entitled in law to these documents. I therefore declined to make the order sought in prayer 3(b) of OS 1339/2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I summarise my conclusions as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I allowed the application in SUM 138/2020 to amend OS 1339/2019.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Issue estoppel applied against the Husband’s contention that ORC 50/2019 should be varied in the manner sought in prayers 3(a) and 3(b) of OS 1339/2019. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applied against the Husband’s argument that the Wife already had access to documents relating to the trust property because of Mr Devin’s and Mr Sandeep’s actions in taking the data and documents from the Husband’s laptop.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Deed of Advancement dated 3 October 2019 was not sufficient to exclude the Wife as a beneficiary of the Clause 5 Trust. However, the Deed and Deed of Appointment dated 10 January 2020 were effective to exclude the Wife as a beneficiary of the Clause 5 Trust. That said, as she was a beneficiary until 10 January 2020, she remained entitled to the account up to and including 9 January 2020. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Even apart from the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, I would not have varied ORC 50/2019 on the basis of the allegation that the Wife, through Mr Devin and Mr Sandeep, had allegedly obtained documents relating to the trust property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) As for the Live Companies’ objections and the Husband’s potential difficulties in relation to those documents, even apart from issue estoppel, I did not consider this to be the appropriate proceedings in which to determine the question, and in any case, a variation of ORC 50/2019 was inappropriate since this was not a question of entitlement to the documents but of enforcement, and the Husband could raise these issues of compliance subsequently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In the round, therefore, only prayer 2 of OS 1339/2019 could be granted. I made the order as follows:

The Husband had succeeded on his alternative position that the January 2020 deeds were sufficient to exclude the Wife as a beneficiary and that she was no longer entitled to an account from 10 January 2020 onwards. The Wife was successful in arguing that the October 2019 Deed of Advancement was not sufficient to exclude her interest, that she remained entitled to the account ordered under ORC 50/2019 even though she was no longer a beneficiary from 10 January 2020 onwards, and that the remaining variations sought by the Husband should not be ordered. In the round, especially given that the Husband’s own successful application was based on the amendment in SUM 138/2020 and that the Wife was successful in her submissions on the effect of the Deed and Deed of Appointment if they were valid, the Wife was the overall successful party. I therefore ordered that the Husband pay to the Wife the costs of OS 1339/2019, SUM 5872/2019 and SUM 138/2020 fixed at $9,000 and disbursements fixed at $3,000, and that the Husband is to bear the said costs and disbursements personally.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat, Kanapathi Pillai Nirumalan, Ow Jiang Meng Benjamin and Ho Jun Yang Joshua (He Junyang) (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin SC, Chang Man Phing Jenny, Gavin Neo Jia Cheng and Khoo Kiah Min Jolyn (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
