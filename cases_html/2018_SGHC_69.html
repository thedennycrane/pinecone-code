Chew is a Singaporean and is also an investor in Enviro. Enviro is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Singapore-listed company called Enviro-Hub Holdings Ltd (“Enviro-Hub”). Enviro-Hub’s business includes recycling of plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, recovery and refining of platinum group metals as well as conversion of waste plastics to fuel.

</div> Enviro’s shareholders (including the plaintiffs) commenced negotiations in or about November 2014 for the buy-out of all the shares in Metahub from its shareholders as they saw synergy in the recycling and waste management activities of the two companies. The key persons from Enviro who negotiated with the defendant on its intended purchase were Raymond and William. It was William who first introduced Raymond to the defendant some 20 years earlier.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Negotiations on behalf of Metahub were conducted by the defendant and Kevin Chee Ho Chun (“Chee”), who is a director and 1% shareholder of the company. There was a preliminary meeting between the parties on 18 November 2014 followed by two other meetings on 12 December 2014 and 14 January 2015. Negotiations between the parties continued until March 2015. Apparently Chee is legally trained as he drafted the initial sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”) for the parties as well as its numerous amended versions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It was contemplated that should Enviro acquire Metahub, the first plaintiff and Chew would each own 20% of Metahub’s shares while William would hold 9% of the shares. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) Raymond deposed that it was his condition that William must be involved in the acquisition if Enviro took over Metahub.

Raymond deposed he was so put off by Chee’s telephone call that he told Chee he was calling off the proposed acquisition by Enviro.

It doesn’t mean they agree with you it’s finalised/approved. Unless you can show to us any email, anything in the documentation to say Enviro-Hub says, “Yes, we agree this is the final document.” The fact that Mr Chee and/or yourself keeps saying to Enviro-Hub this is finalised, this is the approved document to be signed, it doesn’t mean that Enviro-Hub accepts that it is. Do you agree? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court’s view is reinforced by Chee’s own words in his email dated 12 December 2014 (at [45] above) where he used the words in parenthesis “(UNLESS THERE ARE FURTHER AMENDMENTS)”, thereby recognising and accepting the possibility that Enviro-Hub would amend his draft further. After some prevarication, the defendant eventually agreed with the court that the 16 December 2014 email showed the parties were still <span class="font-italic">not</span> in agreement on the terms of the draft SPA:

</div>
</div></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Ct: Until I rule otherwise Mr Ung. You will answer counsel’s questions. We are asking you on an email that Mr Chee sent to Lay Mai. It is clear that as of 16 December 2014, both sides are not in agreement on the terms of the sale and purchase agreement. You must accept that, based on Mr Chee’ email –and Mr Chee is your representative –and the email is also carbon-copied to you, because you are <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">vincent@metahub.com.my</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">A: I agree with what your Honour has said, but I disagree with what counsel had said.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 While on the one hand, the defendant expected the court to recognise an unsigned draft SPA as having legal effect, he asserted on the other hand that the court should disregard the (executed) loan agreement that had been performed by the plaintiffs by their extending him the loan. It bears repeating here what I said at [44] in the stay decision: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The defendant’s case also required the court to believe that a Singapore listed company <span class="font-italic">viz</span> Enviro-Hub and/or its wholly owned subsidiary Enviro would pay a non-refundable deposit of RM4m to carry out a due diligence exercise on a company (Metahub) which they may or may not acquire and for which no purchase and sale agreement had been executed. This would mean that the two companies had disregarded the interests of their shareholders as well as all rules of good corporate governance. The defendant’s version of events also ignored the fact that the plaintiffs here are neither Enviro nor Enviro-Hub.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendant had also overlooked an important factor. Even if <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, Raymond did make any or all of the representations in [33] that the defendant alleged (which the court disbelieved), those representations were not made on behalf of either or both plaintiffs and would not bind them at law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The court was also sceptical of Chee’s email dated 16 December 2014 (at [41] above) for another reason. It is the court’s view that the statement in paragraph 1 therein was untruthful. The court took judicial notice of the fact that it is common practice in the banking industry for loans extended to corporate entities (in this case Metahub) to be secured by personal guarantees from its directors and/or shareholders. It is absurd and makes no commercial sense for a lending bank to take a guarantee from the same corporate borrower. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I do not think it is at all speculative for this court to surmise that the defendant, in his capacity as the director and majority shareholder of Metahub (with or without his wife), would have given a personal guarantee in this case to CIMB Bank for the loan extended to the company. I have no doubt too that CIMB Bank was putting pressure on the defendant to repay the loan extended to Metahub, totally or partially. That would explain why Chee stopped chasing Ms Tan relentlessly to sign the SPA and to pay a deposit after the defendant received the loan in early January 2015. It is equally likely that the defendant utilised the loan (and the further RM1m from William) to repay and/or reduce Metahub’s outstanding liability to CIMB Bank and/or to its other bankers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In this regard, Chee’s message to Ms Tan of 27 February 2015,

</div> which was re-sent by Chee to Ms Tan on 4 March 2015 when she did not respond, is telling:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dear Lay Mai,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Happy Chinese New Year to you!</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would be grateful if you could kindly enlighten us on the progress of the completion of the sale and purchase of the shares of Metahub. As you are aware, the original intention of all parties was to conclude the sale at the soonest possible and the execution of the agreement was originally agreed on 12-12-2014. However, at the buyer’s request we had agreed to our request for conducting the due diligence first and it must be noted that almost 2 months have passes but we have not heard from you on the final outcome of the due diligence neither have we received your draft sale and purchase agreement despite our request.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As you are further aware, one of the conditions for the share sale was that I will not be retained and shall leave Metahub on the completion of the sale and take over. Pursuant therefrom it is of great concern to me as I will need to ensure that I am gainfully employed after leaving Metahub. I am in the process of finalising my new job offer and I hope the completion date for the sale and purchase can be determined so as to enable me to fix my commencement date for my new posting. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I sincerely hope you will notify me of the final dates for completion next week.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The above email reveals a number of interesting facts. First, it was surprising that someone like Chee, who had been so heavily involved in the drafting and negotiations of the SPA since the very beginning, was not apprised of the status of the SPA between the two parties. Second, Chee’s email was even more surprising given his earlier email of 16 December 2014 set out at [41] above. By 16 December 2014 if not earlier, Enviro-Hub had made it plain to the defendant that the payment of any deposit was subject to fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent in cl 3.03 of the draft SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Clause 3.03(i) (as amended by Enviro-Hub) reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the Purchaser(s) being satisfied with the outcome of a due diligence audit on the legal, financial, technical and business aspects of [Metahub] (hereinafter referred to as “Due Diligence Audit”) by the Purchasers at their own cost and that the management, directors and/or shareholders of [Metahub] successfully remedied and/or rectified specific issues/concerns uncovered from the Due Diligence Audit parties agreed that the Due Diligence Audit will not exceed six weeks’ duration,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It was clear from Enviro-Hub’s proposed amendment of cl 3.03 that there would not be payment of any deposit to Metahub without conditions, contrary to the defendant’s pleaded case. Why would Enviro-Hub do a <span class="font-italic">volte face</span> subsequently? In any case, it was not Enviro-Hub that extended the loan to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It was not in dispute that even though the draft SPA never progressed to the stage of being signed, the due diligence exercise on Metahub was carried out. This was due to the signing of the loan agreement – in exchange for the plaintiffs’ monies, the defendant allowed the due diligence exercise to be carried out, and this was done by Enviro-Hub in January 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 One of the reasons that the SPA was aborted (according to the plaintiffs) was Metahub’s refusal to provide a forecast for their business. This was evidenced in Chee’s email to Ms Tan dated 16 December 2014 where he said <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that:

Yet, the defendant expected this court to give credence to the various drafts of that agreement but ignore a signed loan agreement for which he had received valuable consideration from the plaintiffs.

The facts there were somewhat similar to this case. Bravo Building Construction Pte Ltd (“Bravo”) alleged that an executed loan agreement between the parties pursuant to which it received $8.284m from Chesney Real Estate Group LLP (“Chesney”) was not enforceable because the sum was not really a loan but a deposit under a broader agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> a second marketing agreement) made between Chesney and its associated company Pender Development Pte Ltd. The judge has this to say in the following paragraphs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 Bravo argued that the loan agreement was not in fact an independent agreement. According to Bravo, the moneys extended under the Loan Agreement were in truth the Deposit and that the terms and conditions of the Agreement thus applied. Although counsel for Bravo did not say this explicitly, he was effectively arguing that the Loan Agreement was a sham agreement, that is to say, that the parties did not intend for it to have legal effect[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 Having considered these points and the fact that the Loan Agreement was concluded on the same day as that on which the Second Marketing Agreement was signed, I accepted that the Loan Agreement was related to the Agreement. However, it did not necessarily follow that the Loan Agreement was meant to have no legal effect. This conclusion would have been the result of a leap of logic and I could not agree for the following reasons: first, given that this was an arm’s length commercial transaction, the parties would not have entered into agreements lightly, what more an agreement which appeared to have been carefully drafted. It would have been most unusual for the parties to go to the extent of preparing and executing an agreement which was not intended to have legal effect and which was in fact contrary to the parties’ true intentions. Commercial parties do not, in the normal course of events, prepare and execute detailed written contracts that are not what they purport to be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 Third, Bravo’s position becomes even more untenable when one considers the fact that Bravo actually took steps to comply with the terms of the Loan Agreement. It executed the corporate guarantee required under cll 21.1 and 7.1 of the Loan Agreement. It also procured the Insurance Bond from India Insurance with the intention to secure performance of the Loan Agreement at a cost of $327,963.56 pursuant to its obligations to do so under cll 2.2 and 7.2 of the Loan Agreement. It is unbelievable that Bravo would have incurred such costs for the sake of an agreement which was not intended to be effective. Last, Bravo’s failure to respond upon receipt of the demand for repayment was also telling. If indeed the moneys extended under the Loan Agreement were the Deposit, Bravo would have refuted Chesney LLP’s claim, and one would think rigorously. Instead, Bravo chose not to respond.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As was pointed out by the court to the defendant (at [60] above), the defendant should have responded to the emails emanating from Enviro-Hub set out at [25] to [27] to refute that the sum advanced to him was a loan. That would have been a common-sensical response by anyone in the defendant’s position if there was indeed no loan. If not, the defendant should have at the very least (with Chee’s assistance) emailed Raymond and/or Enviro-Hub to record Raymond’s assurance(s) that the loan agreement was only meant to be an acknowledgment of receipt of RM4m deposit. The defendant took neither course of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The fact that the defendant took steps to comply with the terms of the loan agreement further undermined his case (see [29] of <span class="font-italic">Pender</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>quoted above). The defendant had apparently provided security for the loan by way of a legal charge of 20% of the total number of shares in Metahub, pursuant to cl 2 of the Loan Agreement.

</div> The plaintiffs submitted (and the court accepted) that just because the paperwork on the taking of securities was incomplete, that did not mean that the loan agreement itself was a sham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There was one other aspect of the defendant’s testimony which undermined his credibility. The defendant’s case that the loan was a non-refundable deposit under the SPA was re-iterated throughout his defence (amendment no.1) as seen in the following paragraphs therefrom:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6(a) The sum of RM 4 million which the Plaintiffs allegedly loaned to the Defendant was in fact, paid to the Defendant pursuant to an oral agreement reached between himself and one Mr Raymond Ng Ah Hua (“Raymond Ng”) purportedly on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Enviro Investments whereby the said RM 4 million would serve as a non-refundable deposit in furtherance of the intended purchase of all the shares in Metahub.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(r) At the aforesaid meeting (i.e. on 6 January 2015 at Legoland in Johor Bahru), which was also attended by William Ung, Raymond Ng produced the Alleged Loan Agreement and requested that the Defendant sign the same. The Defendant objected to this and specifically told Raymond Ng that he did not need a loan, and further, that it was already agreed that the RM 4 million was a non-refundable deposit payment for the Proposed Acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(s) Raymond Ng then reassured the Defendant that the payment of RM 4 million was indeed a non-refundable deposit as agreed. He also said that the Alleged Loan Agreement was merely to serve as an acknowledgment of receipt of payment as the finalised SPA was not formally signed yet. Raymond Ng reassured the Defendant that there would not be any problem and that the Proposed Acquisition would be completed once the due diligence was done.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(t) It was under these circumstances that the Defendant signed the Alleged Loan Agreement, and it was clearly not intended to be binding between the parties. The payment of RM 4 million was not and could not have been a loan, but was instead payment towards the first tranche of the non-refundable deposit for the Proposed Acquisition of the Metahub shares by Enviro Investments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Yet, when he was cross-examined, the defendant appeared to suggest that the non-refundable deposit was in fact refundable under certain conditions. His confusing testimony was clarified in re-examination in the following extracts:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To ensure that the court’s understanding of the tax letter in Malay was correct, one of the Supreme Court’s Malay interpreters translated the tax letter, and the interpreter’s translation reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">TAKE NOTICE that a certificate under subsection 104(1) of the Income Tax Act 1967 which contained details of the tax, sums and debts so payable by you has been issued to the Commissioner of Police and Director-General of Immigration seeking them to take necessary action to prevent you from leaving Malaysia unless and until you have paid all the income tax the sum of RM854,309.00 (Malaysian Ringgit Eight Hundred Fifty-Four Thousand and Three Hundred and Nine) <span class="font-underline">or until you furnish a satisfactory security for the said sum</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2  DO ALSO TAKE NOTICE that with the issuance of such certificate, it will be an offence if you leave or try to leave Malaysia without settling the tax in full <span class="font-underline">or furnishing a security for the sum stated in the said certificate</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 A copy of the certificate including the extract of section 104 and 115 of the Income Tax Act 1967 is attached herein for your information and attention. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 You are advised to obtain the revocation letter after settling the abovementioned tax, if not, you may be prevented from leaving Malaysia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The defendant’s translated version of the tax letter as shown in [80] was clearly selective and deliberately left out the underlined last lines of paragraphs one and two.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It was obvious that the defendant would go to any lengths (including lying in his 8th affidavit as can be seen from the foregoing) in order to avoid coming to Singapore to testify for this case, for reasons best known to himself. It was untrue that he would not be allowed to leave Malaysia unless he paid his outstanding tax. He only needed to put up security for the outstanding tax in order to leave Malaysia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 There is one final issue the court has to address before concluding these grounds of decision. As observed at [23], the defendant had not called either Chee or William as his witnesses. Yet, on the first day of trial (according to Mr Tay and which the defendant’s counsel confirmed), Chee was sitting in court in the public gallery. Chee was not material to the plaintiffs’ claim based on the loan agreement but he was a crucial witness for the defendant’s defence which was entirely based on the draft SPA which Chee had prepared. Indeed, in the defendant’s 2nd affidavit filed on 23 October 2015 in support of his stay application, he admitted as much at paragraph 42:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In addition, I would also add that apart from the Singapore parties on the purchasers’ side, Chee is also a critical witness as he was present during most if not all of the initial discussions in November and December 2014 pertaining to the Proposed Acquisition, and he will have to be called to prove that there was no concurrent discussion between the Plaintiffs and/or Raymond and I for a personal loan to be extended to me. As Chee is a Malaysian citizen residing and working in Malaysia, I am advised and verily believe that he is not compellable in a Singapore court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 When the court questioned the defendant’s counsel on Chee’s voluntary presence in court notwithstanding the fact that he was not the defendant’s witness, no satisfactory explanation was provided.

</div>
</div> he sought to rely on this court’s stay decision (at [47] and [56]) as an excuse for not calling Chee or William to testify. His reliance on the court’s comments is disingenuous. This can be seen from the following paragraphs of the stay decision:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 I turn next to the issue of witnesses. If the court accepts the plaintiff’s position that the claim had nothing to do with the sale transaction, then the employees of Metahub were not necessary witnesses in any event. If indeed they were required to testify in a Singapore court, case-law states that the issue of compellability does not arise in relation to employees. Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that the defendant’s position is correct, then a very material witness for him would be his brother William.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In this regard it is noteworthy that William had furnished a statutory declaration to the defendant (see [33]) corroborating the defendant’s version of events. Equally noteworthy is the fact that William did not require any receipt and/or documentary evidence of his loan of RM1m to the defendant (according to the plaintiffs) or of his payment of $200,000 to Raymond as his contribution to purchase the defendant’s shares in Metahub (according to William). Further, why did William not file an affidavit on the defendant’s behalf instead of making a statutory declaration? It is also strange that William denied making a loan to the defendant when the defendant admitted to receiving RM5m in total as a non-refundable deposit while the plaintiffs’ claim is only for RM4m. Where did the extra RM1m remitted to the defendant come from?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 The non-compellability of William as a witness in Singapore if the case is not stayed cannot be viewed independently without regard to his relationship to the defendant (as his counsel sought to persuade the court to do). It was absurd to treat William as an independent non-party witness and I declined to do so. As he did not file any affidavit, there was nothing on record to indicate William’s unwillingness to testify in a Singapore court on the defendant’s behalf as the defendant claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 The issue of witness compellability was also considered by the Court of Appeal in an earlier case on <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">non conveniens</span> namely<span class="font-italic"> Rickshaw Investments Ltd. </span>There the issue was whether the Singapore suit commenced by the plaintiffs should be stayed in favour of concurrent proceedings in Germany commenced by the defendant. The court had this to say at [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With respect, we disagree with the judge [who had held that the location of witnesses was not an important factor], as we find that the location of the key witnesses is an important factor to be considered, and the fact that key witnesses are located in Singapore is a factor that points towards Singapore being the most natural forum to hear the substantive disputes. The assessment of the respective witnesses’ credibility is also crucial – especially in so far as the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit is concerned. Indeed, in so far as the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence are concerned, the principal witnesses (as we have already noted in [23] above) are located in Singapore. It is significant, in our view that they are <span class="font-italic">clearly</span> compellable to testify in the Singapore proceedings, whereas this is not the case in so far as the German proceedings are concerned.    </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Here, both plaintiffs are based in Singapore and so too are their witnesses Sam Tan, Raymond and Ms Tan. I find that they are important witnesses. As observed earlier, the defendant’s witnesses who are based in Malaysia are not essential or crucial witnesses to the case. Taken together with this court’s earlier observations (at [43]) on the non- enforceability of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the unsigned sale agreement as opposed to the enforceability of a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause in the signed loan agreement which was the subject matter of the plaintiffs’ claim, the issue of compellability of witnesses weighed in favour of Singapore as a more appropriate forum than Malaysia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It can be seen from the above extracts from the stay decision that the court made no reference at all to Chee. Just like his explanation for Chee’s absence, the defendant’s explanations during cross-examination on William’s absence were equally unconvincing:
