<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Greenlam Asia Pacific Pte Ltd
                    (“Greenlam”), appealed against the decision of the Assistant
                    Registrar (“AR”), who dismissed its application for security for
                    costs to be furnished by the respondent, Wonda Kitchareon Co Ltd
                    (“Wonda”), a company incorporated in Thailand. After hearing the
                    parties, I affirmed the AR’s decision and now give the reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Wonda is a Thai wholesaler of furniture fittings
                    and furniture parts. Its clients are mainly developers, architects and
                    designers. Greenlam, a Singapore company, manufactures and distributes laminate
                    products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 21 April 2009, Wonda purchased 18,820 pieces
                    of “New Mika” laminate and 13,700 pieces of “Liner”
                    laminate from Greenlam. As Greenlam could not supply all the goods in one
                    shipment, it was agreed that Wonda would issue letters of credit after the bills
                    of lading for the goods shipped had been issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to Wonda, the first shipment of goods
                    by Greenlam created numerous problems for it. Among other things, 4,000 pieces
                    of laminate were of the wrong colour, the thickness and dimensions of many
                    sheets of laminate did not conform to the contract specifications, there were no
                    shipping marks on the crates, many of the laminate sheets were damaged, and the
                    shipping documents did not comply with the terms of the letter of credit. As a
                    result, Wonda claimed to have suffered damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There were also problems with respect to the
                    second shipment. Wary of Greenlam’s goods after the first shipment, Wonda
                    wanted to inspect the goods before paying for the goods. However, Greenlam
                    insisted on receiving payment before the inspection of the goods. Wonda, which
                    refused to pay without an inspection, subsequently informed Greenlam that it
                    would not be accepting any further shipments of laminate from the
                latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 20 April 2010, Wonda instituted the present
                    proceedings against Greenlam. Initially, Wonda sought a refund of the
                    US$69,926.14 that it paid to Greenlam as well as damages. However, it was now
                    content to claim damages from Greenlam, which responded with a counterclaim as
                    well as an application that Wonda furnish $50,000 as security for
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Greenlam’s application for security for
                    costs was dismissed by the AR on 24 September 2010. It then appealed against the
                    AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Order 23 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Rules”), which governs the
                    furnishing of security for costs states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1 – (1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">   Where,
                            on the application of a defendant to an action or other proceeding in
                            the Court, it appears to the Court –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    that the plaintiff is ordinarily resident out
                                of the jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court
                        thinks it is just to do so, it may order the plaintiff to give such security
                        for the defendant’s costs of the action or other proceeding as it
                        thinks just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Reference may also be made to s 388 of the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding
                        the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible
                        testimony that there is a reason to believe that the company will be unable
                        to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence, require
                        sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings
                        until the security is given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Creative Elegance (M)
                        Sdn Bhd v Puay Kim Seng</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 112
                        (“<em>Creative Elegance</em>”), the Court
                    of Appeal referred to O 23 r 1(1)(a) of the Rules and s 388 of
                    the Act and pointed out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, of course, a difference in the wordings of the two provisions,
                        but the difference lies in the condition to be satisfied before the
                        respective provisions can be invoked. Under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) the condition which has to be satisfied before
                        the court proceeds to exercise its discretion is: if it appears to the court
                        that the plaintiff is ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction. On the
                        other hand, under s 388 the condition is as follows: if it appears by
                        credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the plaintiff
                        company will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in
                        his defence. Once the condition under the respective provision is satisfied,
                        the court’s discretion is invoked, and in exercise of that discretion
                        the court decides whether or not to order security for costs against the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the present case, Greenlam has furnished no
                    evidence whatsoever that there is reason to believe that Wonda will be unable to
                    pay its costs if it is successful in its defence. On the contrary, in response
                    to Wonda’s complaint in a letter dated 18 June 2009 with respect to the
                    supplying of more laminate sheets of a particular type than had been ordered,
                    Greenlam had replied as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>You are a very big listed company</em>. 400
                        sheets is a very small quantity for you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It follows that Greenlam’s application
                    must be considered in the context of O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules although it is worth noting that in <em>Creative Elegance</em>, the Court of Appeal added (at [13])
                    that “whether the discretion is one under O 23 r 1(1)(<em>a</em>) or under s 388 the same principles are
                    applicable: the court considers all the circumstances and decides whether it is
                    just to order the plaintiff to provide security for costs and the extent of such
                    security”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It does not follow that a foreign plaintiff
                    without an address or assets in the jurisdiction will be ordered to furnish
                    security for costs. The fact that the plaintiff is ordinarily out of the
                    jurisdiction merely means that the court’s discretion to order security
                    for costs is invoked. In <em>Jurong Town Corp v Wishing
                        Star</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 427 (“<em>Wishing Star</em>”), Chao Hick Tin JA explained at
                    [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that it is not an inflexible or rigid rule that a
                        plaintiff resident abroad should provide security for costs. The court has a
                        complete discretion in the matter: see <em>Keary Developments
                            Ltd v Tarmac Construction</em> Ltd [1995] 3 All ER 534. It seems
                        to us that under r 1(1)(a), once the pre-condition, namely, being
                        “ordinarily resident out of the jurisdiction”, is satisfied,
                        the court will consider all the circumstances to determine whether it is
                        just that security should be ordered. There is no presumption in favour of,
                        or against, a grant. The ultimate decision is in the discretion of the
                        court, after balancing the competing factors. No objective criteria can ever
                        be laid down as to the weight any particular factor should be accorded. It
                        would depend on the fact situation. Where the court is of the view that the
                        circumstances are evenly balanced it would ordinarily be just to order
                        security against a foreign plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Porzelack KG v Porzelack
                        (UK)</em> [1987] 1 WLR 420 (“<em>Porzelack KG</em>”), Browne-Wilkinson V-C explained (at 422)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under O 23 r 1(1)(a) it seems to me that I have an entirely
                        general discretion either to award or refuse security, having regard to all
                        the circumstances of the case. However, it is clear on the authorities that,
                        if other matters are equal, it is normally just to exercise that discretion
                        by ordering security against a non-resident plaintiff. The question is what,
                        in all the circumstances of the case, is the just answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     One of the factors to be taken into account by
                    the court in the exercise of its discretion is whether the plaintiff has a
                        <em>bona fide</em> claim with a reasonable likelihood
                    of the success of the claim. In considering this factor, the court does not
                    conduct a detailed examination of the merits of the case. In <em>Porzelack KG</em>, Browne-Wilkinson V-C explained at 423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is the second occasion recently … in which the parties have
                        sought to investigate in considerable detail the likelihood or otherwise of
                        success in the action. I do not think that is a right course to adopt on an
                        application for security for costs. The decision is necessarily made at an
                        interlocutory stage on inadequate material and without any hearing of the
                        evidence. A detailed examination of the possibilities of success or failure
                        merely blows the case up into a large interlocutory hearing involving great
                        expenditure of both money and time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A similar approach was adopted in <em>Omar Ali bin Mohd v Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdulkadir
                        Alhadad</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 407.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, there is a likelihood of
                    Wonda’s claim succeeding. After all, Greenlam had acknowledged a number of
                    the shortcomings and defects in its shipments to Wonda and had suggested a
                    number of ways to iron out the problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Apart from not alleging that Wonda would be
                    unable to pay the costs of the action if it fails in its claim, Greenlam’s
                    counsel, Mr Jagjit Singh (“Mr Singh”), merely asserted that Wonda
                    is a foreign company and that Greenlam has “a <em>bona
                        fide</em> defence on the merits”. These are, without more,
                    insufficient grounds to order Wonda to furnish security for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Finally, it cannot be overlooked that Mr Singh
                    pointed out that Greenlam has a counterclaim “arising out of the same
                    subject matter and connected to the grounds of defence”. That the
                    counterclaim is intrinsically connected with the grounds of defence is evident
                    from the affidavit dated 3 August 2010 of Mr Tiwari Uma Kant, Greenlam’s
                    Chief Operating Officer, who stated at para 14:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendants [Greenlam] have also raised a Counterclaim against the
                        Plaintiffs [Wonda] <em>which is also a defence to the
                            claim</em> as the Defendants content that the Plaintiffs do not
                        have a basis to reject the goods and claim a refund. The Defendants are
                        claiming their loss and damage as a result of the Plaintiff’s refusal
                        to accept delivery and unlawful repudiation of the sales agreement as
                        particularized in paragraph 40 of their Defence and Counterclaim in the sum
                        of US$15,980.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Wishing Star</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal made it clear (at [19]) that where a defence to a claim and
                    counterclaim “are launched from the same platform”, the time and
                    work required for the trial of the counterclaim would be substantially the same
                    as that for defending the claim and costs incurred in defending the action could
                    be regarded as costs necessary to prosecute the counterclaim. The Court added
                    that in such a situation, granting security could amount to indirectly aiding
                    the defendant to pursue its counterclaim. As such, in the present case, to allow
                    Greenlam’s application for security for costs would be to assist it in the
                    prosecution of its counterclaim against Wonda.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     If all the circumstances are taken into
                    account, there can be no doubt that it is just that Wonda should not be ordered
