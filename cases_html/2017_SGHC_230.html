marketing can be traced back to as far as the 1920s. As its name suggests, it is a marketing mechanism which utilises multiple tiers of promoters, with each tier receiving a proportion of the proceeds of sales made to consumers by the salespersons under them. While there is nothing inherently illegitimate with this structure, a multi-level marketing business becomes repugnant if it is predicated on generating profits through the recruitment of new salespersons who pay significant upfront costs for rights under the scheme as well as the right to receive rewards for recruitment subsisting up to several layers downstream. These persons at the top tiers, whom I shall refer to as the uplines, can therefore earn income from the recruitment efforts of their team members, whom I shall refer to as the downlines. A business built on this model is unsustainable. As logic dictates, the pool of potential recruits will eventually run out and the scheme will collapse upon itself, causing the new entrants to suffer significant losses. Underlying the prohibition against this form of multi-level marketing is the policy need to protect members of the public, who might be lured into joining these schemes as salespersons by the prospect of extraordinary financial gains, from such high-risk and unsustainable schemes. When such schemes are deceptively cloaked and packaged into various forms of innocuous marketing or sales programmes by the scheme promoters, it may sometimes be difficult to discern the legitimate from the illegitimate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Against this backdrop, when is it permissible for a business to be built on a multi-level marketing or a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement? This is the central question that arises from the joint appeals before me. It requires the court to interpret the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act (Cap 190, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) as well as the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (Cap 190, O 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Exclusion Order”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The appeals are brought by the first appellant, Chua Hock Soon James (“Chua”), the second appellant, Harriet International Network Pte Ltd (“HIN”) and the third appellant, Harriet Education Group Pte Ltd (“HEG”) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Appellants”). The Appellants appeal against the orders of conviction (“the Appeals”) recorded by the district judge (“the District Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">PP v Chua Hock Soon James, Harriet International Network Pte Ltd &amp; Harriet Education Group Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGDC 71 (“the GD”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After a trial that spanned 16 days, the District Judge convicted the Appellants of the following charges (“the Charges”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Chua’s Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">are charged that you, between December 2007 and September 2008 or around the same period, in Singapore, were the Managing Director of one Harriet Education Group Pte Ltd (“the company”), during which period the said company did promote a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement as defined in section 2 of [the Act], namely the Global Edupreneur Program scheme, which scheme is not an excluded scheme or arrangement as defined in Paragraph 2 of [the Exclusion Order], and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 3(2) read with Section 6(1) of [the Act]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">HIN’s Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">are charged that you, between December 2007 and September 2008 or around the same period, in Singapore, did promote a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement as defined in section 2 of [the Act], namely the Global Edupreneur Program scheme, which scheme is not an excluded scheme or arrangement as defined in Paragraph 2 of [the Exclusion Order], to wit, you allowed your UOB bank account No. [xxx] to be used to receive monies paid by participants of the said scheme and to pay out monies being commissions to participants of the said scheme, and you have thereby contravened Section 3(1) of [the Act] which is an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of [the Act]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">HEG’s Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">are charged that you, between December 2007 and September 2008 or around the same period, in Singapore, did promote a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement as defined in section 2 of [the Act], namely the Global Edupreneur Program scheme, which scheme is not an excluded scheme or arrangement as defined in Paragraph 2 of [the Exclusion Order], and you have thereby contravened Section 3(1) of [the Act] which is an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of [the Act]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chua was sentenced to a fine of $50,000 (in default three months’ imprisonment).

In addition to the benefits earned through their personal recruitment efforts, Country Managers were entitled to a 30% overriding commission on the direct commissions earned by the GEP participants under them. Existing GEP participants could become Country Managers after passing an interview and paying additional licensing fees to extend the period of their licence with HEG. Country Managers were required to provide training and coaching to the GEP participants in their team.

Section 3 of the Act provides that it is an offence for a person to promote or participate in a multi-level marketing scheme or arrangement (“MLM scheme”) or a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement (“pyramid selling scheme”). The Act makes no substantive distinction between a MLM scheme and a pyramid selling scheme and both these expressions bear the same meaning in the Act: see the definition of a MLM scheme in s 2(1) of the Act. As to what constitutes a pyramid selling scheme, s 2(1) of the Act provides as follows:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“pyramid selling scheme or arrangement” means any scheme or arrangement for the distribution or the purported distribution of a commodity whereby — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a person may in any manner acquire a commodity or a right or a licence to acquire the commodity for sale, lease, licence or other distribution;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that person receives any benefit, directly or indirectly, as a result of —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the recruitment, acquisition, action or performance of one or more additional participants in the scheme or arrangement; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of the commodity by one or more additional participants in the scheme or arrangement; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any benefit is or may be received by any other person who promotes, or participates in, the scheme or arrangement (other than a person referred to in paragraph (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or an additional participant referred to in paragraph (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Section 2(2) of the Act goes on to state that a pyramid selling scheme does not include schemes or arrangements excluded by the Minister (“excluded schemes”).

In this connection, the primary issue in dispute at the trial below was the relationship and proper interpretation of paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) and 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order (see [10] above). Here, the District Judge disagreed with both the Appellants’ and the Prosecution’s interpretations and arrived at a different interpretation. In her view, the question to be asked is “whether the benefits in question have accrued predominantly or substantially as a result of the sale … or other distribution of a commodity to any other person” as opposed to “as a result of the introduction or recruitment of additional participants in the scheme”.

The payment of overriding commissions was only a private arrangement in the MOA between some of the Country Managers and GEP participants and the terms of the MOA were not incorporated into the GEP. In any event, none of the Country Managers, who had received overriding commissions, were entitled to receive them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>The burden of proving that the GEP did not satisfy the conditions stipulated in the Exclusion Order fell on the Prosecution. Legislative intention indicates that the Exclusion Order forms part of the elements of the offence in s 3(1) of the Act, and as such, the burden of proof was on the Prosecution to show that the Appellants did not fall within the Exclusion Order. Since there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the GEP satisfied the Exclusion Order, the Appellants should be acquitted of the Charges against them.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>The District Judge’s interpretation of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order was contrary to both a plain reading and a purposive interpretation of that provision. Instead, the correct interpretation should be that as long as the requirements in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) are met, then it is irrelevant whether any benefits accrued as a result of recruitment under paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order. Since it was undisputed that the GEP fulfilled paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii), the GEP was not a pyramid selling scheme for the purposes of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>Even if the District Judge’s interpretation of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) was correct, she erred in applying the test. The objective evidence did not show that the benefits earned by the GEP participants were predominantly or substantially from the recruitment of additional participants, but rather that it was from the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of commodity. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(e) </span>In addition to the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement laid down by the District Judge, the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of an offence under s 3(1) of the Act also required the Prosecution to prove that the Appellants knew that the GEP amounted in law to a pyramid selling scheme as well as the fact that the GEP did not fall within the Exclusion Order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(f) </span>Lastly, Chua could avail himself of the s 6(2) defence – he did not consent to or connive in the offence and had also exercised sufficient due diligence. The structure for the payment of overriding commissions was originally a private arrangement between individual GEP students. These GEP students approached Chua to request that HEG assist by facilitating their private arrangement. Furthermore, Chua had taken steps to ensure that the overriding commissions were not gratuitous in that valuable consideration in the form of training and an earnings guarantee was given by the Country Managers to their team members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Unsurprisingly, the Prosecution disagreed with all of the Appellants’ submissions and instead sought to uphold the District Judge’s decision in its entirety for broadly similar reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Young <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">micus Curiae</span>, Ms Lee Chia Ming (“Ms Lee”) assisted the court on the following issues: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>whether the GEP was a pyramid selling scheme within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>whether s 3(1) of the Act provides for a strict liability offence and, if not, what is the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>for the offence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>whether the GEP was a franchise scheme or arrangement which fell within any of the exemptions in paragraph 2 of the Exclusion Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>which party bore the burden of proving that the GEP fell or did not fall within the exemptions in the Exclusion Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(e) </span>whether the Appellants had promoted the GEP within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(f) </span>whether the s 6(2) defence was available to Chua; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(g) </span>whether the defence of mistake applied to Chua.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Generally, Ms Lee agreed with the decision of the District Judge (albeit for different reasons on some of the issues).

First, it is clear from the language of the definitions of pyramid selling scheme and commodity at [38] and [39] respectively that the net is cast very widely to catch as many schemes as possible for all kinds of commodities: consider the wide import of the words in the definitions such as “<span class="font-italic">purported</span> distribution”, “<span class="font-italic">any</span> manner acquire”, “directly or <span class="font-italic">indirectly</span>”, “<span class="font-italic">any</span> benefit”, “is or <span class="font-italic">may be</span> received” and “<span class="font-italic">any</span> goods, service, right or <span class="font-italic">other</span> property” [emphasis added]. It is evident from the legislative debates pertaining to the Act that this was in no way unintended – the definitions were deliberately crafted widely to achieve the desired purposes of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Act was in its original form conceptualised as the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Bill (Bill 45 of 1973) (“the 1973 Bill”) and passed as the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act 1973 (Act 50 of 1973) (“the 1973 Act”). The objective of this enactment was to enshrine Singapore’s zero tolerance approach to pyramid selling schemes, which have the potential to cause widespread financial ruin to their participants due to their unsustainable business model. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As expressed in the Explanatory Statement to the 1973 Bill:

Transposed to the context of a pyramid selling scheme, the chain letter would request participants, upon receiving the chain letter, to transfer a fixed sum of money for distribution to other members already in the existing chain, which earns the participants the right to distribute the chain letter to multiple new recipients after adding themselves to the chain. In this way, once a participant adds his name to the chain, he will constantly be paid a portion of the fee by each new recipient of the chain letter subsequently added as a member to the chain, who pays the required fixed sum of money that entitles him to send out even more of such chain letters.

</div> In my judgment, these arguments are non-starters. No matter what additional conditions were imposed on the payment of overriding commissions, the fact that this is an agreement that HEG was a party to, and an arrangement which it undertook to carry out personally, means that the payment of the second overriding commission was part of the GEP. The payment of the second overriding commission is clearly a relevant benefit that falls under the third requirement because it is a pecuniary reward received by A (a Country Manager/Global Manager) on account of B (a team member under A) recruiting C (a new GEP participant). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, the Appellants allege that overriding commissions were rarely paid out, no Global Managers were paid overriding commissions and none of the Country Managers, who received overriding commissions, were entitled to receive them.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, this submission is simply a misguided attempt by the Appellants to downplay the presence of overriding commissions in the GEP. Even if I accept the Appellants’ premises in this submission, these are entirely irrelevant considerations. As is evident from the clear language of the third requirement in s 2(1), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “any benefit is or <span class="font-italic">may be</span> received” [emphasis added], a scheme will be caught by the Act as long as the scheme <span class="font-italic">potentially</span> entitles any third person to a benefit, even if no such benefits are <span class="font-italic">actually</span> paid out. Thus, even if it is difficult for such benefits to be paid out such that not many receive the benefit, the fact that it is <span class="font-italic">possible</span> for such benefits to be received is sufficient basis to find that the third requirement is satisfied. This makes sense as, if it were otherwise, an artful promoter could temporarily circumvent the law by deferring the payment of benefits. The scheme would then not fall within the scope of the prohibition in the Act despite the fact that many members of the public are joining the scheme with substantial upfront costs. That would be a nonsensical outcome. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Third, the Appellants submit that the payment of overriding commission was for the training and the earnings guarantee provided by the Country Managers to their downlines, and was thus not a benefit derived from the recruitment of GEP participants.

</div> I disagree. There is nothing on the face of the MOA that suggests that it was the GEP participants’ as well as the Country Managers’ intention that the 30% overriding commission was consideration for the training and earnings guarantee. Even if such an intention existed, it cannot explain away the second overriding commission that was paid directly by HEG. It also cannot distinguish the overriding commission that Global Managers stood to receive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Accordingly, I find that the third requirement of the definition of a pyramid selling scheme under s 2(1) of the Act is met and the GEP is a pyramid selling scheme.

On this point, there is a preliminary dispute between the Parties as to who bears the burden of proving whether the GEP qualifies as an excluded scheme which I will first address. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Which party bears the burden of proving whether the GEP is an excluded scheme</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Section 2(2) of the Act provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this Act, “pyramid selling scheme or arrangement” shall be taken not to include such schemes or arrangements for the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of a commodity, or any class of such schemes or arrangements, as the Minister may by order prescribe, subject to such terms or conditions as may be specified in the order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Pursuant to s 2(2) of the Act, the Exclusion Order was enacted to exclude prescribed schemes and arrangements that meet the conditions stated therein.

</div> take the contrary view and argue that the burden lies with the Appellants to show that the GEP satisfies the conditions in the Exclusion Order. On an application of the principles stated in ss 107 and 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”), they both submit that the purpose of the Act as well as the relative ease of burden of proof militate in favour of the conclusion that the burden lies with the defence and not the Prosecution. I agree with the Prosecution and Ms Lee on this issue. Before I give my reasons, it will be helpful to first set out the law on this area.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Where the statute is silent on burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In a criminal case, whilst the general starting point is that the Prosecution has to prove all the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">essential ingredients of the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">offence, there is an important exception to this principle (see </span><span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Tee v PP </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 311 at [13]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is a fundamental rule of our criminal law that the Prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged. This is a common law rule which is not embodied in any legislative enactment but is English in origin. In England the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">R v Edwards </span>[1975] QB 27 held that <span class="font-italic">if an enactment under which a charge is laid, on its true construction, prohibits the doing of acts, subject to provisos, exemptions and the like, then the Prosecution can rely upon the exception to the fundamental rule of the common law of England that the Prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Where the legislation expressly states that the burden of proving a fact lies on a certain party, there is little difficulty as to whom the burden falls on. However, most provisions do not use clear language to designate the burden of proof. In such cases, the position in Singapore has been set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kum Chee Cheong</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span>”), where it was held at [25] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where an enactment prohibits the doing of an act <span class="font-italic">save in specified circumstances</span> or by persons of specified class or <span class="font-italic">with</span> <span class="font-italic">specified qualifications</span> or with licence or permission of specified authorities, it is <span class="font-weight-bold">a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">matter of construction</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whether the burden</span><span class="font-italic"> of proving the circumstances, qualification, licence or the like </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shifts to the defendant,</span> and if on the true construction of the enactment, the burden shifts to the defendant it is for him to show that he is entitled to do the prohibited act and <span class="font-italic">that burden is not an evidential burden but a legal burden</span>.

In the earlier English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span>, it was decided that where a statute may be construed as prohibiting acts “save in specified circumstances or by persons of specific classes or with special qualifications or with the license or permission of specified authorities” (“the <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> formulation”), the burden of proof will be on the accused to prove that he falls within one of these situations (at 39–40). The approach in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> determines the incidence of burden of proof based on whether the language of the statute falls within any of the limbs in the <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> formulation. Subsequently, in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span>, a different approach was adopted. It was held that “… the court is not confined to the language of the statute. It must look at the substance and the effect of the enactment.” (at 380). Whilst <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> was considered to be correctly decided on the facts, the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> preferred to refer to the rule in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as a “guide to construction” rather than as an immutable rule – there might be other situations (not falling within the <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> formulation) where the statute ought to be construed as imposing the burden of proof on the accused (at 375). In particular, the following oft-cited passage from Lord Griffiths in <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> (at 374), which was referred to in <span class="font-italic">Kum </span><span class="font-italic">Chee Cheong</span> at [38], is worth reproducing here: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]f the linguistic construction of the statute did not clearly indicate upon whom the burden should lie the court should look to other considerations <span class="font-italic">to</span> <span class="font-italic">determine the intention of Parliament such as the mischief at which the Act was aimed and practical considerations affecting the burden of proof and, in particular, the ease or difficulty that the respective parties would encounter in discharging the burden</span>. I regard this last consideration as one of great importance for surely Parliament can never lightly be taken to have intended to impose an onerous duty on a defendant to prove his innocence in a criminal case, and a court should be very slow to draw any such inference from the language of a statute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It is evident from the foregoing that <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> (and <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span>) adopt different approaches. The <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> formulation is often referred to as the “syntax” approach, which determines the incidence of the burden of proof based on the language of the enactment. In contrast, <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> and <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong </span>adopt a “construction of statute” approach to determine on whom Parliament placed the burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 What is however unclear is the relationship between these common law principles and the statutory principle stated in s 107 of the EA (not considered in <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span>), which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Burden of proving that case of accused comes within exceptions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">107.</span> When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code (Cap. 224), or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In some sense, s 107 of the EA codifies the position in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span>, which places the burden of proof on the accused where it is an exception or proviso in the law defining the offence. The question that then arises is what role the rules of construction (stated in <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> and <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span>) play in relation to s 107 of the EA. How do the statutory principle in s 107 and the common law principles interact? As described by Professor Pinsler, the relationship between the two turns on whether the court will construe s 107 as being solely concerned with the form of the provision (the “syntax” approach) or with its substance (the “construction of statute” approach) (see Jeffery Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Pr</span><span class="font-italic">ocess </span>(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 12.029):

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The issue here is whether the court will construe the exception or proviso to determine whether it is one of substance or form. It would be one of substance if, despite its form, it is concerned with the elements of the offence. If the court, in applying the <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> principles, interprets the legislation governing the offence as creating an exception or qualification in substance so that it is for the prosecution to prove that the exception or qualification does not apply, then the accused would merely have an evidential burden with regard to that exception or qualification. For example, if the provision states: ‘A person may not sell any fish except <span class="font-italic">ikan</span><span class="font-italic"> merah’</span>, the court might conclude that it is for the prosecution to prove that the fish sold by the accused was not <span class="font-italic">ikan</span><span class="font-italic"> merah</span> rather than for the accused to prove that he sold <span class="font-italic">ikan</span><span class="font-italic"> merah</span>. In this situation, the accused would only have to adduce evidence which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he had sold <span class="font-italic">ikan</span><span class="font-italic"> merah</span> (even though the exception appears in form). Such an interpretation (which would be based on the substantive effect of the provision) might be justified on the assumption that it would be relatively easy for the prosecution to prove the type of fish which was sold, as the prosecution would not have a case unless it had evidence of what the accused had been selling. Alternatively, the court may conclude that s 107 is solely concerned with form so that the word ‘except’ imposes the burden of proof on the accused notwithstanding any other considerations (including the <span class="font-italic">Hunt</span> principles). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The learned authors in Tan Yock Lin and S Chandra Mohan, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Procedure in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2015) also identify that the difficulty lies in determining what is an exception or proviso within the meaning of s 107, and advocate the application of a substance over form approach to this problem (at paras 1055–1102).

</div>
</div> In a similar vein, the preference for form has been criticised by Glanville Williams in Glanville Williams, “The Logic of Exceptions” (1988) 47 CLJ 261 on the basis that there is “no assurance that the order of words represent a considered legislative judgment as to the burden of proof” (at p 272).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I agree with these academic commentaries that substance should be favoured over form. The particular words used in a statutory provision (unless there is clear indication as to their implications for burden of proof) might just be completely fortuitous. Why should it matter if the provision reads “a person shall not do X <span class="font-italic">except </span>when it is Y” or “a person shall not do X <span class="font-italic">provided </span>Y is met” as opposed to “a person shall not do X <span class="font-italic">unless</span> it is Y”? Does Parliament invariably intend that it is only when the words “provided” or “except” (corresponding to the words “exception” or “proviso” in s 107 of the EA) are used, as opposed to “unless”, that the accused bears the burden of proof? That clearly cannot be right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is important to note here that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> was based on its predecessor, <span class="font-italic">R v Turner</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1816) 5 M &amp; S 206 (“<span class="font-italic">Turner</span>”), which also decided that the burden of proving an exception lies with the accused. However, the position adopted by the Court of King’s Bench in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>is justifiable on two unique grounds (see Chin Tet Yung, “Burden of Proof on the Accused: An Unacceptable Exception” (1981) 23 Mal LR 267 at pp 270–271). First, it concerned a minor offence, which made it easier to place the burden on the accused. Second, there were about ten different exceptions in the statute creating the offence such that placing the burden instead on the prosecution would have given rise to a “moral impossibility of ever convicting” an offender for the offence (<span class="font-italic">Turner</span> at 210). The rationale for the rule was explained as follows by Lord Ellenborough CJ in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 210):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... If the informer should establish the negative of any part of these different qualifications, that would be insufficient, because it would be said, non liquet, but that the defendant may be qualified under the other. And does not, then, common sense shew, that the burden of proof ought to be cast on the person, who, by establishing any one of the qualifications, will be well defended? …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The burden was thus rightly placed on the accused in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> to show that he was within one qualification and not within any other. There were thus good reasons why the rule in <span class="font-italic">Edwards</span> evolved the way it did. However, it cannot be the general rule for the determination of burden of proof. Even if there is only one exception which is in <span class="font-italic">substance</span> an element of the offence, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Professor Pinsler’s example (see [72] above) of selling any fish except <span class="font-italic">ikan</span><span class="font-italic"> merah</span>, the burden of proving that exception would be placed on the accused under the “form” approach. This is patently an undesirable and unintended outcome given that it is in substance an element of the offence, for which the Prosecution should bear the burden. But that is the conclusion that is reached if a simplistic and formalistic approach is adopted in applying s 107 of the EA. From a policy point of view, this is indefensible and a “substance” approach is thus preferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 A “substance” approach would also rationalise any perceived inconsistencies between <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span> and s 107 of the EA. In my judgment, the “construction of statute” approach in <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span> must first be applied to determine whether the positive or negative facts are intended, when established, to constitute a true exception or proviso within the meaning of s 107 of the EA. If so, the accused is to bear the burden of proof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In this vein, as alluded to above at [69], a key consideration is also the relative ease of proof. This is also statutorily reflected in s 108 of the EA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">108.</span> When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I will now turn to consider a few cases which have applied these principles. In <span class="font-italic">Kum Chee Cheong</span>, the Court of Appeal had<span class="font-italic"> </span>to determine the proper construction of s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the MVA”), which read as follows (it has now been amended):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it shall not be lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle <span class="font-italic">unless</span> there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic"> policy of insurance</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Unlike the present case, it was common ground in<span class="font-italic"> Kum Chee Cheong</span> that the accused bore the legal burden of proof in relation to showing that he had a valid policy of insurance (at [14]) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a positive fact). However, the court was asked to decide whether the Prosecution had to adduce <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the accused did <span class="font-italic">not</span> have such insurance (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a negative fact) before the accused was called upon to discharge his legal burden. The court decided in the negative. This was because the purpose of the MVA is to provide for compulsory insurance to cover the risks of injury or damage to third parties arising from the use of motor vehicles (at [39]). Additionally, the fact that there was in force at the material time an insurance policy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a positive fact) was fully within the knowledge of the accused. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In the court’s </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">view, it was significantly easier for a user of a motor vehicle to prove the existence of such a policy as he could simply produce it, whereas “it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult for the Prosecution to prove that [the user] did not have in force at the material time such policy of insurance” (at [39]). Therefore, there was no necessity for the Prosecution to adduce any </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">prima </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">facie </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">evidence</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> of the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">absence</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> of such insurance</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (at [39]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">PP v R </span><span class="font-italic">Sekhar s/o R G Van </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 456, an undischarged bankrupt was charged with an offence under s 141(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 1996 Rev Ed) of obtaining credit without informing the lender that he was an undischarged bankrupt. The High Court held that the burden was squarely on the undischarged bankrupt to show that he had informed the proposed lender of his status before obtaining credit, having regard to the object of the provision to protect innocent people and businesses from being misled by a bankrupt’s appearance of solvency, and the impracticality of the Prosecution having to prove the fact of non-disclosure by the undischarged bankrupt (at [23]–[26]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts – the Appellants bear the burden </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(1) Objective and structure of the Act </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the present case, the objective of the Act is to prevent the risk of financial loss and hardship posed to persons who may be lured into objectionable pyramid selling schemes in Singapore. Given Parliament’s view as to the gravity of the mischief, the Act aims to “eliminate” such objectionable schemes (see [44] above) while making provision for orders to be made to exclude non-objectionable schemes and arrangements. The Exclusion Order was seen to be necessary to allow legitimate businesses to continue (see [117] below). Nonetheless, the primary evil of the Act was not ignored. Parliament intended to promulgate a wide definition of “pyramid selling scheme” to remove the previous rigidities in the Act and to render the Act more effective in its prohibitory function (see [41]–[48] above). In this connection, an <span class="font-italic">additional</span> requirement for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in each case that an accused person does not fall within any of the exceptions within the Exclusion Order would be inconsistent with Parliament’s express intent behind legislating for a wide definition of “pyramid selling scheme”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The structure of the Act also fortifies the conclusion that Parliament intended the legal burden of proof to be placed on the accused person who seeks to rely on the Exclusion Order. The Act states a broad definition of “pyramid selling scheme” with provision for orders to be made to exclude specific classes of non-objectionable schemes. This is different from the legislation in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, where there are either no such carve-outs or the definition of a pyramid selling scheme is itself substantially qualified. For instance, the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Act No 51 of 1974) (Australia)

</div> require the courts, in deciding whether a scheme is a pyramid scheme, to have regard to certain criteria in determining whether an element of the definition (that participation payments under the scheme are entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants of entitlement to recruitment payments) is satisfied. These enactments are thus structured so as to clearly place the primary burden on the prosecution to prove as part of its case that the accused is engaged in a pyramid scheme rather than a <span class="font-italic">legitimate</span> business driven by the sale of products and services. In contrast, such an inquiry is not relevant in determining whether a scheme is a pyramid selling scheme as defined under the Act. This suggests that the Act creates a <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> scheme which is different from its counterparts in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 From the consideration above of the objective and structure of the Act, the Exclusion Order is in<span class="font-italic"> substance</span> more akin to an exception to the offence of promoting a pyramid selling scheme rather than an element of the offence (as the Appellants argue). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(2) Practical considerations and relative ease of proof</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In addition to the purpose and structure of the Act, the practical considerations on proof militate in favour of the conclusion that the Appellants bear the burden of proof in this case.

Section 2(1) of the MLA </span>defines “moneylender” as a person by reference to certain conditions, but clarifies that this category of persons “<span class="font-italic">does not include</span> any excluded moneylender” [emphasis added]. It is thus similarly worded to the Act which defines a pyramid selling scheme as one that is “taken<span class="font-italic"> not to include</span>” the excluded schemes [emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [63] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2014] 3 SLR 524</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sheagar</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”),</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>the Court of Appeal dealt with the burden of proof under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, Act 31 of 2008), an earlier version of the MLA, which does not materially differ from the MLA in relation to this issue. In <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>, the borrower alleged that the lender was an unlicensed moneylender such that, pursuant to s 14(2) of the MLA, the contract for the loan granted by the lender was unenforceable. This provision would not have applied to the lender if he was an excluded moneylender; and the issue was whether the lender or the borrower bore the burden of proving that the lender was an excluded moneylender under s 2(1) of the MLA. The Court of Appeal held that the burden fell on the borrower to prove that the lender was <span class="font-italic">not</span> an excluded moneylender. At [75], the Court of Appeal summarised the principles to be adopted in relation to s 14(2) of the MLA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>To rely on s 14(2) of the MLA, the borrower must prove that the lender was an “unlicensed moneylender”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>If the borrower can establish that the lender has lent money in consideration for a higher sum being repaid, he may rely on the presumption contained in s 3 of the MLA to discharge this burden. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>The burden then shifts to the lender to prove that he either does not carry on the business of moneylending or possesses a moneylending licence or is an “exempted moneylender”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>However, <span class="font-italic">if there is an issue as to whether the lender is an excluded moneylender, the legal burden of proving that he is not will fall on the borrower</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 At first blush, the principle stated in [89(d)] above lends support to the Appellants’ interpretation that the Prosecution (likened to the borrower in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>) as opposed to the Appellants (likened to the lender in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>) bears the relevant burden of proof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 However, the specific reasons that motivated the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span> to arrive at this conclusion do not apply in the present case. After extensively discussing the legislative history of the MLA (at [57]–[67]), the Court of Appeal concluded that the MLA “simply does not apply to lenders who fall within the definition of ‘excluded moneylender’”. Most pertinently, the Court reasoned that the MLA provided for a benefit of a presumption as to who is a “moneylender” under s 3 of the MLA and this had a “<span class="font-italic">material</span> <span class="font-italic">bearing</span> on the burden of proof” [emphasis added] (at [69]–[73]). The specific decision is thus distinguishable from the present Appeals because it turned on the interpretation and effect of a unique presumption provision in the MLA. In contrast, the Act provides no such presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Accordingly, I find that the burden of proof to demonstrate that the GEP is an excluded scheme falls on the Appellants. Even if I am wrong on this point, and the Prosecution bears the burden instead, for the reasons stated below, I am of the view that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the GEP is not an excluded scheme. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the GEP is an excluded scheme</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I turn now to the primary issue in dispute in the Appeals, which is whether the GEP qualifies as an excluded scheme for the purposes of the Exclusion Order. The Appellants, during the Appeals as well as the trial below, focused on the applicability of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Exclusion Order, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the GEP is a master franchise scheme or arrangement (“franchise scheme”) that satisfies conjunctively all the terms and conditions in sub-paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the Exclusion Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 To recapitulate, the relevant provisions read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Excluded schemes and arrangements</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">2.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(1) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The </span>definition of “pyramid selling scheme or arrangement” in section 2 of the Act shall be taken not to include any of the following schemes <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">or arrangements:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any master franchise scheme or arrangement, or any class of such scheme or arrangement, whereby a person is given the right to sub-franchise a franchise, subject to the scheme or arrangement satisfying the terms and conditions in sub-paragraph (<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any scheme or arrangement, or any class of such schemes or arrangements, which satisfies the following terms and conditions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) any benefit received —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-3 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A) by any promoter of, or participant in, the scheme or arrangement accrues as a result of the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of a commodity to any other person;

The difficulty, however, is that the proper interpretation of the phrase “subject to sub-paragraph (ii)” in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order is not immediately clear – it requires one to determine the relationship between paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) and 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii). In this vein, three possible interpretations have been canvassed at the trial below and during the Appeals. These possible interpretations are premised on paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii)(A) of the Exclusion Order (as opposed to the alternative limb 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii)(B)) because that is the limb which the Appellants claim the GEP satisfies. Nevertheless, the determination on the proper interpretation will equally be applicable to paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii)(B) of the Exclusion Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The first interpretation is that paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) is the <span class="font-italic">controlling</span> paragraph such that as long as “any benefit received” accrues as a result of the conditions stated therein, it is irrelevant if paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) is not met. This means that a scheme is excluded where the benefit to be received arises from the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of a commodity <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">even if</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that benefit is received “as a result of the introduction or recruitment of one or more persons to be participants in the scheme or arrangement”. In other words, it does not matter if the benefit received by a Country Manager/Global Manager arises as a result of the introduction or recruitment of a new GEP participant, provided that the benefit can be said to have also been received as a result of the sale of a place in the GEP scheme to the new GEP participant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the commodity. This is the interpretation the Appellants suggest.

First, as presently formulated, the second interpretation might disqualify every pyramid selling scheme as there is typically at least one participant in such a scheme who can be said to have received a benefit as a result of the recruitment of one or more additional participants, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the person who personally recruits an additional participant (“the immediate recruiter”). Whilst this is the logical consequence of the second interpretation, it is not the intended outcome – as long as the immediate recruiter is the only person to receive a benefit for recruiting another, such a business model does not rely on the chain-letter expansion model (see [46] above) as the right to receive benefits for recruitment does not subsist past one level. To prevent the second interpretation from disallowing such schemes, it should be construed to prohibit only schemes where benefits arising from recruitment accrue to someone other than the <span class="font-italic">immediate</span> recruiter, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the other uplines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I am fortified in this restrictive reading of the second interpretation by the structure of the Act and the Exclusion Order. Returning back to the definition of a pyramid selling scheme, in the same scenario where B acquires a licence through A, B in turn recruits C and B receives a benefit as a result of the recruitment of C, there are four possible situations (see [38] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>A receives no benefit;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>A receives a benefit as a result of the recruitment by B of C;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>A receives a benefit as a result of the performance of C; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>A receives a benefit <span class="font-italic">both</span> as a result of the recruitment by B of C and as a result of the performance of C.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear that situation (a) would not amount to a pyramid selling scheme because the third requirement would not be satisfied. In contrast, situations (b)–(d) would constitute a pyramid selling scheme. Now, applying the original second interpretation, all of the situations (b)–(d) would not qualify for exclusion. It is clear why situations (b) and (d) would not qualify because A receives a benefit from recruitment in both situations. Situation (c) would also not qualify because <span class="font-italic">B</span> receives a benefit from recruitment. The fact that none of the situations which constitute a pyramid selling scheme qualify for exemption would mean that the Exclusion Order is meaningless and Parliament would then have acted in vain in enacting it. That is a very unlikely result (see <span class="font-italic">Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] SGCA 50 at [38]). More pertinently, it would be odd for situation (c) to not qualify for exemption because the only person to receive a benefit from recruitment is C’s immediate recruiter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, B. The same fact is present in situation (a), but situation (a) is not even considered a pyramid selling scheme in the very first place. The only additional fact in situation (c), as compared to situation (a), is that A receives a benefit from C’s performance, which is perfectly legitimate given that the benefit arises from the sale of a commodity. Situation (c) must thus qualify for exemption and constitute a legitimate scheme. This analysis makes it plain that Parliament did not intend that a scheme be disqualified from exclusion merely on account of the fact that the <span class="font-italic">immediate recruiter</span> receives a benefit for his recruitment efforts (as opposed to another upline or someone else receiving such a benefit). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 On the face of it, allowing benefits to be received from recruitment by the immediate recruiter might be inconsistent with paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the Exclusion Order, which reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Excluded schemes and arrangements</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">2.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(1) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The </span>definition of “pyramid selling scheme or arrangement” in section 2 of the Act shall be taken not to include any of the following schemes <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">or arrangements:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any scheme or arrangement, or any class of such schemes or arrangements, which satisfies the following terms and conditions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) a person shall not be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to participate in the scheme or arrangement, other than the purchase of sales demonstration equipment or materials at a price not exceeding their cost which are not for resale and <span class="font-italic">for which no commission, bonus or any other advantage will be given to any person</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the Exclusion Order is clear on its face: no benefit can accrue to <span class="font-italic">any person</span> from the recruitment of a participant into the scheme. However, this is a condition that only non-franchise schemes have to satisfy. In contrast, a franchise scheme only has to satisfy paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) of the Exclusion Order (see paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Exclusion Order). This means that, while a franchise scheme allows benefits to be received by an immediate recruiter, a non-franchise scheme does not. In other words, a non-franchise scheme has, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an additional condition (in addition to paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii)) to be satisfied in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i), which prohibits all forms of benefits from recruitment. Seen in this light, there is no inconsistency between the first modification made to the second interpretation and paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the Exclusion Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The second modification stems from the question as to whether a literal interpretation of the words “as a result of the introduction or recruitment” in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) should be adopted. Consider the same scenario where overriding commissions are paid to a person, A for the sale of <span class="font-italic">products</span> made by C in a scheme where C is recruited by B and B is recruited by A. On a strict interpretation of “as a result”, the scheme should be outlawed because A would not have received the benefit in question if A had not <span class="font-italic">recruited</span> B in the first place (and if B had not <span class="font-italic">recruited</span> C). In my judgment, this would lead to an unintended outcome because the <span class="font-italic">direct</span> source of the benefit received by A would be the sale of a product by C to end customers and not the recruitment of a participant. In other words, the benefit would arise as a direct result of the sale and not as a <span class="font-italic">direct</span> result of recruitment. Such a scheme would not rely on the chain-letter expansion model (see [46] above) and thus would not involve the attendant high risks of collapsing. Further, taking the literal interpretation of “as a result” to encompass any indirect mode of causation would mean that no pyramid selling schemes could conceivably fall within paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Exclusion Order because most of the benefits received can ultimately be traced to a recruitment effort. This was <span class="font-italic">not</span>, however, the intention of Parliament in enacting the Exclusion Order, which was designed to “give assurances to legitimate businesses” that they would not be “unwittingly caught by the Act” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(9 May 2000) vol 72 at col 178 (Mr Lim Swee Say, Minister of State for Trade and Industry)).

</div> S888 was a company involved in e-commerce and had, as part of its business model, adopted a franchise scheme. Each participant had to pay an upfront fee of $27,000 for website space to sell products over the Internet. The participants could use this space to recoup their investments through online sales. Each participant also earned a fixed commission of $3000 from S888 for every additional member they recruited and any subsequent additional member in turn recruited by such additional members (this right to receive the commission subsisted to five levels of uplines for each participant). As is evident from the above, the S888 scheme would satisfy paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Exclusion Order because any benefit received by a participant could be said to have accrued from the sale of a “commodity”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the website space to new participants. If the first interpretation is adopted, the S888 scheme would thus have been an excluded pyramid selling scheme. This result would be directly at odds with Parliament’s intent for such schemes to <span class="font-italic">not</span> be excluded under the Exclusion Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 For these reasons, the first interpretation is untenable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Third interpretation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Although the third interpretation fashioned by the District Judge and Ms Lee (which looks at the predominant source of the benefit) is not as implausible as the first interpretation, it is not without difficulties. First and foremost, this interpretation is not borne out by the words of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Exclusion Order. In fact, the third interpretation requires a fair amount of judicial legislation and requires the court to read into paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) an additional provision which reads (there could be other similar variations): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the benefit can be said to accrue as a result of any of the events stipulated in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) as well as a result of the prohibited source of benefit in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii), the scheme will be an excluded scheme only if the benefits in question accrue predominantly or substantially as a result of the sale or other distribution of a commodity to any other person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the absence of such a statutory provision and/or cogent parliamentary intention to that effect, I am not inclined to adopt the third interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Second, the third interpretation might potentially be difficult or even impossible to apply in practice. Whether a scheme predominantly generates benefits through recruitment or through the sale of commodities might not be immediately apparent in every case. If the third interpretation is to be adopted, the court has to determine, in each and every case, which is the predominant source of benefit for the uplines. This can potentially create evidential difficulties. In most pyramid selling schemes, participants can earn commissions by either recruiting additional participants and/or by selling a product or service. It is conceivable that some downlines may exclusively go about chalking up commissions through recruiting more participants while others may exclusively earn commissions by selling the product or service. Which group of participants is the court supposed to consider in determining the predominant source of benefits for the uplines? Is it principled for the determination of whether a pyramid selling scheme is an outlawed scheme to turn on facts as to how the scheme was carried out as opposed to the design of the scheme from the very outset? These questions demonstrate the difficulty with the potential application of the third interpretation which depends on the subsequent relative outcome of the sales performance and success in recruitment (over which the scheme promoters have no control) to determine whether a pyramid selling scheme is not illegal. If in one year, the predominant source of the benefits comes from sales but in a subsequent year, the predominant source of the benefit comes from recruitment, is the scheme in the first year legitimate as an excluded scheme but illegitimate in the second year because it is no longer an excluded scheme due to the fact that the predominant source of the benefit comes now from recruitment instead? This approach is thus patently unsatisfactory and engenders unwarranted uncertainty for scheme promoters and participants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Lastly, the third interpretation creates potential loopholes and requires the court to exercise value judgments on commercial matters to prevent abuse. For instance, one can easily conceive of a scheme where the commodity in question is said to be training in business and entrepreneurship. Whenever a new participant enters the scheme, he pays a large fee for this training, which is beyond the typical market value of the training offered. The large fee paid ostensibly for training is meant by the scheme promoter to cover or hide the new participant’s fees to join the scheme to enable him to participate in its benefits, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where he is entitled to also receive commissions from all his subsequent downlines. In other words, the total benefit to all the uplines from having a new participant recruited is hidden within the large fee charged to each new recruit effectively for both his training and his membership or participation in the scheme. In such a situation, if the court were to “pierce the veil” and find that there is in substance a recruitment or membership fee embedded within the large training fee paid by the new participant, how is the court to determine whether the predominant source of commissions paid to the uplines is effectively from the recruitment of the participant into the scheme or the payment for the real value of the training that is being offered to the participant? The court will be required to make “value” judgments in the literal sense, by putting a dollar value on the worth of the training in determining the predominant source of the benefit. This is an undesirable position, which is an additional reason that weighs against the adoption of the third interpretation. Instead, if the modified second interpretation is adopted, the existence of an element of benefit from the recruitment of the scheme participant to all the uplines (excluding the immediate recruiter), the quantum of which is irrelevant, will be sufficient. There is no need for the court to determine its quantum relative to the dollar value of the benefit that should in reality be attributed to the element of training in order to establish whether the predominant source of the benefit arises out of recruitment or the training provided to the participants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 For the reasons given above, the proper interpretation of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order is the modified second interpretation. The overall effect of the modified second interpretation is the following. Using the same scenario where A recruits B and B in turn recruits C, A <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> receive benefits arising from the recruitment of C into the scheme by B but A can receive benefits arising from both B and C’s performance (not involving recruitment efforts) in relation to the sale, lease, licence or other distribution of the commodity offered. In my view, this is precisely the outcome Parliament intended to achieve. There is nothing inherently objectionable in A receiving benefits connected with the supply of a commodity, as provided in paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Exclusion Order, because the underlying benefit in question is received as a result of the sale of a good or service. In contrast, the danger with pyramid selling schemes is when overriding benefits are received as a direct result of recruitment because here the motive to earn more commissions leads to the aggressive push by the uplines for their downlines to aggressively recruit until a point where there are no more willing recruits, at which point the scheme collapses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Using the facts of the Appeals as an example of how the modified second interpretation is to be applied, the GEP will not be an excluded scheme for non-satisfaction of paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) if A gets any overriding commission from the licence fee paid by C to join the GEP. In contrast, where A gets overriding commissions only as a result of B and/or C’s sale of HEG’s educational programmes to students, the GEP will satisfy paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(3) Application to the facts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Applying the modified second interpretation, it is clear in the present case that the GEP flouts paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order. This is a fact that even the Appellants do not and cannot disagree with. It is an undisputed fact in the present case that where C, a new GEP participant, is recruited by B (an existing GEP participant), overriding commissions are payable to A (the Country Manager of B), based on B’s earned income, which earned income included B’s commission for recruiting C: see [8(h)] above. This is a benefit that accrues to A (the non-immediate recruiter of C) as a direct result of the recruitment of C into the GEP and thus contravenes paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Exclusion Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Even if the proper interpretation is the third interpretation, I agree with the District Judge and Ms Lee that the GEP would not be an excluded scheme. The Appellants submit that the commodity in HEG is the licence to sell HEG’s educational programmes as well as the training and earnings guarantee provided by the Country Managers to GEP participants, such that the predominant source of the overriding commissions is the sale or other distribution of a commodity and not the recruitment of GEP participants.

</div> The Appellants are thus seeking judicial usurpation of the legislative function by asking the court to read this set of amorphous criteria into the Act, a step I am not inclined to take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In relation to the definition of a pyramid selling scheme, a similar view was expressed by Yong Pung How CJ<span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Tan Un </span><span class="font-italic">Tian v PP </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Un </span><span class="font-italic">Tian</span>”), which is the only reported case of prosecution under the previous version of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31  Be that as it may, it was necessary for Parliament to define what would, in law, constitute a pyramid selling scheme which was to be outlawed following the introduction of the Bill. In my view, the terms of the definition are unambiguous. It does not seek to incorporate all the objectionable features. Neither, in my judgment, would it have been desirable to do so, as the purpose would then be too easily defeated by cleverly avoiding any one of the features. One must not therefore simply proceed by way of comparison between the features found in an archetypical scheme and a scheme in any particular case. Otherwise, whether a scheme constitutes a pyramid selling arrangement would depend on the number of objectionable features present in it or the percentage of semblance the scheme bears to the prototype. The law cannot be reduced to a simple mathematical exercise. <span class="font-italic">Given all the material facts, one must be able to say with confidence whether something constitutes a pyramid selling scheme, instead of being left to </span><span class="font-italic">second guess how many objectionable features there need to be before a trial judge is convinced that the requirements in the statutory definition are satisfied</span>. In arguing for a purposive approach to interpretation, one must also bear in mind the policy considerations so clearly stated in s 9A(4) of the IA, namely, the desirability of the public being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the statutory provision and the need to avoid prolonged and wasteful litigation. <span class="font-italic">Using the method of counting the number of objectionable features in order to decide whether there is in any particular case a pyramid selling scheme would only serve to usher in a state of uncertainty.

Further, as explained above, there is also a catalogue of other conditions to be satisfied.

Amongst others, paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) is clearly not satisfied (see [115] above). The relevant provision reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-italic">a person shall not be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to participate in the scheme or arrangement</span>, other than the purchase of sales demonstration equipment or materials at a price not exceeding their cost which are not for resale and for which no commission, bonus or any other advantage will be given to any person;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It is evident that the GEP does not satisfy this condition. A GEP participant has to pay a licence fee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, provide a benefit) in order to recruit more participants into the GEP as well as to market HEG’s educational programmes to potential students (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in order to participate in the GEP scheme). This licence fee does not qualify as “purchase of sales demonstration equipment or materials”. Even if it does, the fact that commissions are paid to the immediate recruiter and/or to the other uplines means that this condition is not satisfied (see [116] above). Since the GEP plainly contravenes paragraph 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the Exclusion Order, it comes as no surprise that the Appellants’ case is founded instead on the premise that the GEP is a franchise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Turning now to the position where the GEP is a franchise scheme, it would still not qualify for exemption because, as explained above, it fails to fulfil paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) and (iv) of the Exclusion Order. Since the Appeals centred on the latter and I did not have the benefit of full arguments on the former, I prefer to rest my decision that the GEP is not an excluded scheme on its failure to fulfil paragraphs 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) and (iv) of the Exclusion Order as opposed to its not being a franchise scheme in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As is clear from the foregoing analysis, the question of whether the GEP is a franchise scheme is not central in the Appeals because the Appellants’ convictions stand either way, regardless of that determination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether s 3(1) of the Act imports a mens rea requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The next issue to be determined is whether the offence under s 3(1) of the Act imports a <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement and if so, whether the Appellants satisfy this element of the offence. The relevant section reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unlawful to promote or participate in, or hold out that person is promoting or participating in, pyramid selling scheme or arrangement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>—(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to promote or participate in a multi-level marketing scheme or arrangement or a pyramid selling scheme or arrangement or to hold out that he is promoting or participating in such a scheme or arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 It is undisputed that there is no express <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>requirement in s 3(1) of the Act. This, however, is not the end of the matter, for there is a common law presumption that <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> is an essential ingredient of an offence, albeit one that may be displaced expressly or by necessary implication (see <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">PP </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">v Koh Peng Kiat</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2016] 1 SLR 753</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Koh</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Peng Kiat</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [58]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In this vein, the District Judge held that the presumption of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>was not displaced as the offence under s 3(1) of the Act is “not a regulatory provision dealing with an issue of social concern such as public safety or public welfare” and it had “also not been shown that the imposition of strict liability is necessary in order for the provision to be effective in prohibiting pyramid selling schemes or arrangements”.

</div> She cites two reasons. First, the Act and, in particular, s 3(1) of the Act was enacted to deal with an issue of “serious social concern”. Second, construing 3(1) of the Act as a strict liability offence will promote the intended purpose of the Act to eliminate such schemes rather than simply attempting to control them. The effectiveness of the Act would be weakened if accused persons were permitted to escape liability for their involvement in promoting such schemes on the basis that they lacked <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">158 </span>Before I begin my analysis, as a preliminary point, I should point out that there are conceptual and practical difficulties with categorising offences as “strict liability” or otherwise, as highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Koh</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Peng Kiat</span>. The issue in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Peng Kiat </span>was whether an offence under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Health Products Act (Cap 122D, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Health Products Act”), which provides that no person “shall supply, or procure or arrange for the supply of, any health product which is … a counterfeit health product”, was a strict liability offence. The court articulated two main difficulties with the concept of “strict liability”. First, “strict liability” is a somewhat <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">protean </span>concept, given that there are different degrees of “strictness” <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">in terms of the degree to which the Prosecution is spared from its burden of proving a mental element in respect of every p</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">hysical element of the offence </span>(at [52]–[53]). Second, the physical and mental elements of a crime may overlap <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">where </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">there is an implied state of mind in respect of a physical element of the offence</span>. For these reasons, just as was done in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Peng Kiat</span>, it is <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">more accurate and conceptually clearer</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> to characterise the inquiry as one of whether the Prosecution bears the legal burden of proving a mental element in respect of every physical element stated in the offence, rather than simply whether the offence is one of “strict liability”: see also </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chinpo</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v PP </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2017] SGHC 108</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [49]. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 With this background in mind, I turn now to consider the offence under s 3(1) of the Act. There are two primary physical elements that must be proven by the Prosecution: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>the act of promoting, participating or holding out that one is promoting or participating (“the first physical element”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>this act must be in connection with a MLM scheme or a pyramid selling scheme (“the second physical element”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The question is whether any of these physical elements imports a <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement. In respect of the first physical element, the mere fact of promotion or participation implies that the accused must have knowledge of the scheme as one cannot possibly promote or participate in something that one does not know anything about. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s observation in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Koh</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Peng Kiat </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">that </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“a person can only ‘procure or arrange for the supply’ of something if he has a certain state of mind. He must at least know that he was procuring, or arranging the supply of that something” (at [54]). </span>Separately, the notion of promotion or participation also means that there is some mental element on the part of the accused, as both involve an intention by the accused to be part of the scheme. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">much was accepted by the Prosecution during the trial, when it acknowledged that the terms of s 3(1) of the Act imply that the accused must have some knowledge or intention that he is promoting or participating in the scheme.</span>

Here, I agree with Ms Lee that the presumption of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> is displaced. As referenced by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yue Mun Yew Gary</span> [2013] 1 SLR 39 at [15], the question to be asked is whether “the weight of the public interest” protected by the offence is sufficient to displace the presumption of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>. In my judgment, the weight of the public interest protected by the Act is sufficient to outweigh the need for a mental element in respect of the physical element of the existence of a pyramid selling scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The weight of the public interest protected by s 3(1) of the Act is evident from a perusal of the parliamentary debates. The genesis of the Act is rooted in Parliament’s aim to prevent financial loss and hardship in Singapore, similar to that suffered by persons in other countries who had been lured into pyramid selling schemes (see [44] above). Identifying these schemes as “so clearly contrary to the public interest that the objective should be to <span class="font-italic">eliminate them rather than </span>attempt to<span class="font-italic"> control them</span>”, Parliament made the decision to “<span class="font-italic">outlaw</span> the practice before it becomes widespread and before members of the public here are induced to part with their savings on a large scale” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (28 August 1973) vol 32 at col 1287 (Mr Hon Sui Sen, Minister for Finance)).

</div> The above conveys the gravity of the harmful effects that pyramid selling schemes can cause to the public and Parliament’s determination to stymie the practice entirely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Seen in this light, reading the second physical element as importing no mental element would “rigorously promote the intention of Parliament” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Kwee v </span><span class="font-italic">PP </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 122 at [21]) by absolutely prohibiting any persons from promoting or participating in a pyramid selling scheme, thereby ensuring that the practice is stymied, with an aim to completely eliminating it altogether rather than simply attempting to control them. In this respect, the intention or knowledge of the person promoting or participating in the pyramid selling scheme (whether held in good faith, or tainted with <span class="font-italic">mala fides</span>) is not a matter which affects the public, who would still be vulnerable to falling prey to objectionable pyramid selling schemes as long as they subsist. There can be no room for argument that offenders did not intend to create such schemes, or had honestly believed that they were not promoting a pyramid selling scheme (when they were in fact doing so). Support for this can also be drawn from <span class="font-italic">Tan Un </span><span class="font-italic">Tian </span>where Yong CJ noted at [44]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 … As the Legislature intended the Act to be prohibitory and not regulatory, it was inevitable that the net had to be so widely cast as to prevent such activities from even coming into existence.

But having said that, I should add that it would be extremely difficult to prove dishonesty or fraud in relation to these pyramid selling schemes under the existing general principles of our criminal and civil law. New provisions are, therefore, essential to deal specifically with this practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In order for the presumption of <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> to be displaced, this result must not only promote Parliament’s intent; it must also be shown that accused persons can do something to avoid committing the offence. As stated by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Sweet v Parsley</span> [1970] AC 132 at 163 (quoted with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Koh</span><span class="font-italic"> Peng Kiat</span> at [64]; see also <span class="font-italic">Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney General of Hong Kong</span> [1985] AC 1 at 13–14):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here the subject-matter of a statute is the regulation of a particular activity involving potential danger to public health, safety or morals in which citizens have a choice as to whether they participate or not, the court may feel driven to infer an intention of Parliament to impose by penal sanctions a higher duty of care on those who choose to participate <span class="font-italic">and to place upon them an obligation to take whatever measures may be necessary to prevent </span><span class="font-italic">the prohibited act</span>… But such an inference is not lightly to be drawn, nor is there any room for it <span class="font-italic">unless there is something that the person on whom the obligation is imposed can do directly or indirectly, by supervision or inspection, by improvement of his business methods or by exhorting those whom he may be expected to influence or control, which will promote the observance of the obligation </span>(see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-underline">Lim Chin </span><span class="font-underline">Aik v.

Persons who may potentially fall within s 3(1) of the Act can exercise greater vigilance to scrutinise pyramid selling schemes and be wary of involvement in them, to ensure that they do not inadvertently promote or participate in potentially illegal schemes or hold themselves out to do so. In particular, the persons who are best placed to ensure that such schemes comply with the law are those who organise and manage the schemes and they can do so by seeking legal advice and implementing a system of appropriate checks.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In addition, the Act’s effectiveness in eradicating pyramid selling schemes would be weakened if accused persons were permitted to escape criminal liability on the basis that they lacked <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> in relation to the existence of a pyramid selling scheme. Here, there exists a risk identified in <span class="font-italic">K</span><span class="font-italic">oh Peng Kiat</span>, that accused persons (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… are unlikely to be cooperative and requiring the Prosecution to prove knowledge would lead to fewer prosecutions, to the detriment of society, given how easy it is for any one trader [accused person] to deny his state of knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Although this observation was made in the context of the Health Products Act, it applies squarely here as there can conceivably be difficulties in proving that each and every participant in a pyramid selling scheme knows about all the features in the scheme. In particular, it may be unduly onerous to require the Prosecution to prove in every case that a promoter of or a participant in a pyramid selling scheme knew that someone other than his immediate recruiter would receive benefits from the scheme, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for C to know that A would receive benefits for B’s recruitment of C. But this is what the District Judge’s analysis implies by requiring the Prosecution to prove knowledge of the third requirement (see [29] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Even if there is a mental element in respect of the second physical element of the offence<span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 3(1) of the Act, I do not accept the Appellants’ contention that the Prosecution must prove that the Appellants knew that the GEP amounted <span class="font-italic">in l</span><span class="font-italic">aw </span>to a pyramid selling scheme.

The appellant argued that he was operating under the belief that he did not need a permit for the assembly, due to the police’s response that no permit was required for a similar event conducted by him just three days earlier. Quentin Loh J upheld the finding made by the trial judge that the appellant was essentially raising a defence of “mistake of law” which could not stand. The issue was whether a permit was required for the assembly conducted by the appellant, and this was a question of law. Loh J held that the codification of defences in the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) does not allow such a defence to be accepted. Section 79 of the Penal Code draws an express distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law, and expressly excludes the latter from being a defence to criminal offences (<span class="font-italic">Chee Soon Juan</span> at [50]–[51] and [57]). The fact that mistake of law is not a valid defence must mean that ignorance of the law is also not a valid defence. In a similar vein, it has been pointed out that the Penal Code framers most likely intended ignorance of law to be “subsumed” under the concept of mistake of law (<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (LexisNexis, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Revised 2nd Ed, 2015) (“Yeo, Morgan and Chan”) </span>at p 531).

This approach is consistent with the pragmatic and utilitarian underpinnings for not recognising a defence of mistake of law – if ignorance of law is admitted as a ground of exemption, the courts would be involved in questions which are almost impossible to solve (such as whether the party involved is really ignorant of the law, and is so ignorant that he has no surmise of its provisions) and which can scarcely be determined by any evidence accessible to the Prosecution. This will render the administration of justice next to impracticable. Further, recognising mistake of law as a defence would encourage ignorance despite the law-makers’ determination to make men know and obey the relevant laws. Any concerns relating to the individual justice is rightly outweighed by the larger interests of society (see <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Yeo, Morgan and Chan</span> at p 516).

</div> The accused had contended that mistake or ignorance of the law in their particular circumstances was an excuse. The Alberta Provincial Court specifically rejected this argument and held that as long as it was proven that the accused conducted, managed or was a party to the scheme, and knew what the scheme was and how it operated, no other proof was necessary to show any other type of intention or mental element (at [35]–[36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 From these authorities, it is clear that the Appellants’ contention that the Prosecution must prove that they knew the GEP amounted in law to a pyramid selling scheme is untenable. At most, the Prosecution would be required to prove that the Appellants knew that the GEP bore features which satisfied the three definitional criteria of a pyramid selling scheme under s 2(1) of the Act. In the present case, I have no reason to disturb the District Judge’s findings that, at all material times, the Appellants knew what the GEP was, knew how it operated and thus knew of the three requirements which rendered the GEP a pyramid selling scheme.

</div> A similar definition is found in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary where “engage in” is stated as either “to do (something)” or “to cause (someone) to take part in (something)” (<div style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">&lt;</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engage%20in&gt; (accessed 10 July 2017)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)</span>.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>, the Supreme Court of Western Australia had to interpret s 24(4) of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA) (“the Fair Trading Act”), a provision in <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> materia</span> to s 3(1) of the Act, presently superseded by the Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Act No 51 of 1974) (Australia), the relevant part of which provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">24.

Nevertheless, the court adopted a wide definition, in line with the statutory purpose of s 24(4) to stamp out pyramid trading schemes (<span class="font-italic">Hawkins </span>at [15]). It becomes immediately apparent that the Act in Singapore shares a common statutory purpose with that of s 24(4) of the Fair Trading Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The facts in <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span> concerned a pyramid trading scheme which involved a set of records being maintained by the accused persons, who were collectively called the board master, to enable participants in the scheme to keep track of their statuses. The Supreme Court of Western Australia expressly disagreed with the lower court’s narrow construction of “promote” as requiring encouragement of the scheme in the sense of drawing in participants and excluding a merely “reactionary role” as that of board master. Thus, using first principles, the Supreme Court favoured a very broad interpretation, which did not require the restriction of promotion to advertising or similar activity, save that this should not include ministerial or advisory acts which in ordinary language would not be called “promotion” or “taking part in promotion”. Some of the examples of conduct falling short of being considered promoting included anonymous recording of details and mailing of details to participants without any <span class="font-italic">meaningful</span> role in the design or origination of the recording system or responsibility for a meaningful part of scheme activity that might be represented by such recording system of mail-out (<span class="font-italic">Hawkins </span>at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Applying the guidelines stated in <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>, even if HIN’s role in the GEP is likened to that of a passive “reactionary role”, that does not in and of itself mean that HIN’s conduct did not come within the meaning of “promote”. More importantly, HIN’s involvement was not mere ministerial or advisory acts falling within the narrow examples raised in <span class="font-italic">Hawkins</span>. HIN had played a very <span class="font-italic">meaningful</span> role in GEP’s design. Without the payment service offered by HIN, the GEP would not have been able to operate – the existence of a functional payment stream is an indispensable feature of any pyramid selling scheme.

Just because a person does a criminal act coupled with several non-criminal actions, does not make him any less guilty of the offence as someone who only does the criminal act. The offence under s 3(1) of the Act is triggered once there is promotion of a pyramid selling scheme by a person, even if the act of promoting the pyramid selling scheme formed only a small part of his business activities. Thus, the inquiry as to whether there was “promotion” concerns the role played by one relative to the scheme, as opposed to how significant or major these efforts were in relation to one’s overall activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 For these reasons, I have no reason to disturb the District Judge’s conclusion that HIN promoted the GEP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 For completeness, although the Appellants do not expressly dispute this, I find that it is also proven beyond a reasonable doubt that HEG promoted the GEP.

The GEP, with its particular feature of payment of overriding commissions to the Country Managers and Global Managers, is exactly how Chua intended the GEP to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 I propose to deal with the s 6(2) defence in its two constituent parts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Chua consented or connived to HEG’s offence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The interpretation to be accorded to the words “consent” and “connivance” was recently considered, albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>, by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Ghani Bin Tahir v PP</span> [2017] SGHC 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Ghani</span>”) at [99]–[100]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">99 … there is also a fine difference in culpability between “consent” and “connivance” under English law – consent requires more explicit an agreement for the illegal conduct to take place. In <span class="font-italic">Huckerby</span><span class="font-italic"> v Elliot </span>[1970] 1 All ER 189, although the Divisional Court was essentially concerned with whether the appellant had committed an offence by reason of her neglect, Ashworth J noted that a fellow director of the company had pleaded guilty to a charge under the “consent” limb. In this connection, he expressed his approval for the following remarks which had featured in the magistrate’s judgment from whose decision the appeal arose (at 194): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would seem that where a director consents to the commission of an offence by his company, he is well aware of what is going on and agrees to it … Where he connives at the offence committed by the company he is equally well aware of what is going on but his agreement is tacit, not actively encouraging what happens but letting it continue and saying nothing about it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Attorney General's Reference No 1 of 1995</span> [1996] 1 WLR 970, the English Court of Appeal was asked to answer the question as to what was required to be proved against a director to show “consent”. Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ concluded that a director must be shown to have known the material facts that constituted the offence by the body corporate and to have agreed to its conduct of the business on the basis of those facts (at 981). Subsequently, Lord Hope in <span class="font-italic">Chargot</span> endorsed this test, adding that consent can be established by either inference or proof of an express agreement (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In the absence of any other local decisions from the Supreme Court in Singapore, I adopt the above-mentioned interpretation accorded to the words “consent” and “connive” in English law. As is clear from the survey of English law in <span class="font-italic">Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Ghani</span>, “consent” carries the connotation that the person consenting is aware of the facts constituting the offence and agrees to it. In contrast, “connive” has the connotation that the person is aware of what is going on and being in a position to do something about it, turns a blind eye and does nothing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he acquiesces to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Applying these principles, it is clear to me that HEG’s offence of promoting a pyramid selling scheme cannot be said to have been carried out without Chua’s consent.

As the learned authors of Amanda Pinto QC &amp; Martin Evans, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Criminal Liability</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2013) put it: “[w]hat constitutes due diligence is an objective fact; ignorance of the law is no excuse” (at para 20-23).

I unreservedly commend her industry and care in assisting me in deciding this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 I close with a note of caution. It is an offence to join a MLM or pyramid selling scheme as a mere participant, just as much as it is an offence to promote such a scheme, as the Appellants have done. Any prospective participant who is keen on joining such schemes should be prudent to check whether the scheme he seeks to join confers any financial benefit on an upline as a result of his downline’s recruitment of new participants. If that is the <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> of the scheme, then joining it is likely to violate the law. Lucrative promises of reward with minimal effort, merely through the recruitment efforts of downlines, is a tell-tale sign of illegality. Such is the case with schemes like the one before us today. In the end, the old adage is vindicated: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Philip Fong Yeng Fatt, Nicklaus Tan, Sui Yi Siong and Chie Zi Han (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Appellants;<br/>Hon Yi, Kok Shu-En and Nicholas Lim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Respondent;<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><div style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"><br/></div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Lee Chia Ming</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) as Young </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Amicus Curiae</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
