<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 On 22 January 1992, the Plaintiffs entered into a contract with

<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 For the purpose of securing protection and indemnity against, inter

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The conversion work to the Vessel was carried out during the period

February 1992 to January 1993. Grit blasting and spray painting were carried out. At the

material time, a yacht, the El Corsario was undergoing warranty and docking works at a

neighbouring shipyard at No 29, Tuas Crescent, <font face="CG Times" size="3">Singapore</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 In June 1995, the Plaintiffs received a claim from the owners of the

El Corsario for damage allegedly caused by the grit blasting and spray painting works

carried out by the Plaintiffs on the Vessel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The Plaintiffs referred the claim to the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">. On 4

October 1995, the </font><font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"> denied liability principally on the ground

that the claim was not being brought against the Plaintiffs as the owner but as the

repairer of the Vessel. Consequently the Plaintiffs were not entitled to be indemnified

under Clause 19. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 On 31 August 1996, the owners of El Corsario commenced proceedings in

Suit 1627 of 1996 against the Plaintiffs and the neighbouring shipyard Kvaerner

Fjellstrand (S) Pte Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 As liability to indemnify the Plaintiffs had been denied by the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">, the Plaintiffs conducted their own defence through their own solicitors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 Pending the hearing of Suit 1627 of 1996, the Plaintiffs on 6

February 1998 filed these proceedings for, inter alia, a declaration that in the event

that they were held liable for the claim made by the owners of the El Corsario, they were

entitled to be indemnified by the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants under

clause 19 of the Collective Policy </font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">in respect of the said claim including all interest and costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 Eventually, the claim in Suit 1627 of 1996 was settled on 25 August

1998 when, by consent, the claim was dismissed with no order as to costs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 On 1 March 1999, the Plaintiffs amended their claim herein to one

for declaration, inter alia, that they ‘be entitled to be indemnified by the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"> for their legal costs incurred in defending Suit 1627 of 1996 pursuant to Clause

19’ of the Collective Policy. The amount claimed is $146,193.96.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 These proceedings came up for hearing before me. I dismissed the

Plaintiffs’ claim. The Plaintiffs have appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my

reasons.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 Clause 19.1 provides that the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"> shall indemnify the Plaintiffs as the

Assured in respect of ‘any sum or sums paid by Assured to any person or persons by

reason of the Assured becoming legally liable, as Owner of the Vessel…’ It is

thus quite clear that the indemnity provided is against liability incurred by the Assured

as ‘Owner’ of the Vessel. The other sub-clauses of clause 19 also relate to

liability of shipowners or persons in possession of a ship as owners or as operators.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 In <i>Rigby &amp; Ano. v Sun Alliance &amp; London Insurance Ltd</i>

[1980] 1 Lloyd’s Law Reports 359, a policy on buildings contained an ‘Additional

protection’ clause reading:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<i>Additional protection:</i> … the Company will pay to the

  Insured… (13) the amount of claimant’s damages (including costs and expenses)

  arising out of the Insured’s liability at law attaching solely as owner, not

  occupier, of the house in respect of (a) accidental bodily injury (including death or

  illness) to any person, or (b) accidental damage (including loss) to property happening in

  or about the house during any period of insurance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.1 The issue before the court was whether that clause would indemnify

the insured against claims by their neighbours for damage to the latter’s property

allegedly caused by encroachment of the roots of oak trees on the insured’s property.

The claim was based on the tort of nuisance which is concerned with the wrongful use of

land by a defendant who may or may not be the owner. In holding that the claims were not

within the scope of the policy, Mustill J stated at p 364:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The liability must attach to the insured "as owner".

  These words are apt to describe not the capacity of the insured or the history of the

  liability, but the character of the liability itself. To my mind they denote that the

  status of the insured as owner is an integral part of the cause of action against him, and

  not merely that in practice he would never have found himself in the position of receiving

  a claim and being held liable if he had not been the owner of the premises. This view

  corresponds with the opinions expressed on a very similar point by Mr. Justice McNair and

  Lord Justice Diplock delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>Sturge v.

  Hackett,</i> [1962] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 117, at p. 124, and [1962] 1 W.L.R. 1257."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 In <i>Sturge v Hackett </i>[1962] 1 Lloyd’s List Law Reports

117, the defendant obtained a policy of insurance covering his liability as

‘occupier’ of a flat in a house up to 100,000 and his personal liability for

negligence up to 10,000. The house was destroyed by fire resulting from the

defendant’s efforts to burn a birds’ nest under the eaves of the house while

standing on the balcony which he was permitted to use. The owner of the house brought an

action against the defendant for 50,000. The insurer brought an action for declaration

that his liability under the policy was limited to 10,000 under the personal negligence

clause. In granting the declaration, McNair J stated at p 124:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In my judgment, the phrase "All sums for which the Assured

  (as occupier…) may be held legally liable" in the section of the policy headed

  "Liability to the Public" clearly relates, and relates only, to a well-defined

  group of liabilities imposed upon occupiers of premises. The words "as occupier"

  connote that occupation is an essential ingredient of the liability and are not merely

  descriptive of the identity or status of the person to whom liability attaches."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.1 The defendant appealed. Though the appeal was allowed by the Court

of Appeal, Diplock LJ upheld McNair J’s construction of the words ‘as

occupier’:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In our view, the learned Judge was right in law in holding that

  the question whether Colonel Hackett’s liability falls within the occupier’s

  liability clause depends upon whether the fire that caused the damage started upon

  premises of which he was the occupier."</p>
<p align="justify">See <i>Sturge v Hackett</i> [1962] 1 Lloyd’s List Law Reports 626

  at 631.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 My attention was drawn to the decision in <i>Chrismas v Taylor

Woodrow Civil Engineering Ltd and Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd </i>[1997] 1 Lloyd’s Law

Reports 407. That case concerned a floating platform which could be moved though not under

its own power. It could also be jacked up on legs which rested on the seabed with the

platform itself raised above the level of the water. The platform was owned by the first

defendants and was at the time on demise charter to the second defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.1 The platform was insured with the plaintiff. The policy named the

assured as Taylor Woodrow Plc, including charterers. The plaintiff accepted that the

second defendant was an assured under the policy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.2 The policy conditions incorporated the Institute Time Clauses

Hulls Port Risks which provided, inter alia, that ‘[t]he Underwriters agree to

indemnify the Assured for any sum paid by the Assured to any other person or persons by

reason of the Assured becoming legally liable, as owner of the Vessel, for any claim,

demand, damages and/or expenses, where such liability is in consequence of any of the

following matters … [par. 4] Including cover in respect of liability arising out of

goods … being lifted and/or transported mechanically or otherwise by the insured

equipment and/or craft for the purpose of any contract for works or otherwise.’</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.3 The second defendant was using the platform as a platform for a

crane which it employed in work for a water authority. There was a provision in the

contract between the water authority and the second defendant that on completion of the

works the second defendant should clear away and remove from the site all constructional

plant plus material, rubbish and temporary works of every kind and leave the whole of the

site and permanent works clean and in a workmanlike condition. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.4 While the platform was jacked up it was struck by an exceptionally

large wave which lifted it off its legs. The crane fell off the platform and sank. The

second defendant incurred substantial expense in removing the crane from the seabed and

sought to recover such expenses from the insurers under the policy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.5 Judge Kershaw held that though the second defendant were

charterers and not owners, they were entitled to be indemnified under the policy in

respect of their expenses in removing the crane from the seabed. In delivering his

judgment, the learned judge stated at p 411:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I have reached the conclusion that the fourth paragraph of the

  condition does apply only to liabilities which would be covered by the Institute Times

  Clauses and that it is a requirement of cover under the fourth paragraph that it should be

  by reason of the assured becoming legally liable, … the second defendant would be

  insured, by reason of the fourth paragraph, against liabilities which fall upon the second

  defendant, in the sense that they would have fallen upon the first defendant as owner but

  instead fall upon the second defendant under a demise charter. …</p>
<p align="justify">… I have reached the conclusion that the second defendant became

  liable to remove the crane from the seabed not in any way as charterer or because it was a

  charterer by demise and an owner would have been liable, but purely and simply and solely

  because of its contractual obligation to the water authority."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 Relying on <i>Chrismas v Taylor Woodrow </i>and the description of

the four named insureds in the Collective Policy containing the words ‘for their

respective rights and interest’ the Plaintiffs contended that they, as ship

repairers, were entitled to be indemnified in respect of the claim brought by the owners

of the El Corsario. They also contended that as the <font face="CG Times" size="3">Defendants</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"> had wrongfully repudiated liability to

indemnify them under the Collective Policy, they took steps to defend the claim as a

prudent uninsured. The defence resulted in the claim against them being withdrawn. But the

Plaintiffs incurred costs as between solicitor and client in defending the said claim for

which they should be reimbursed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">My decision</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 In my view, <i>Chrismas v Taylor Woodrow </i>turned on the special

wording of sub-paragraph 4 of the policy. This sub-paragraph is not in the Collective

Policy. Accordingly, the case is of no assistance. The Collective Policy only covered the

Plaintiffs’ liability as owner and not as repairers of the Vessel. Accordingly, I

dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim with costs. I would also add that if the Plaintiffs

as ship repairers are covered under the terms of the Collective <font face="CG Times" size="3">Policy</font>, their claim will still be subject to a deductible of $50,000 under

clause 10.</p>
