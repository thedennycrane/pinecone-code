The plaintiff law firm, Messrs Legis Point LLC (“the Plaintiff”), filed the present originating summons under s 113 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”) against its client, Ms Tay Choon Ai (“the Defendant”), for an order that the Plaintiff be entitled to tax its costs incurred in accordance with the terms of the fee agreement between them. However, both sides have presented differing interpretations of the fee agreement in question. At the heart of the dispute is whether the fee agreement imposed what may be loosely termed a “hard cap” on the amount of fees and disbursements that could be charged by the law firm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Having heard the parties’ arguments, I agree with the Defendant’s interpretation of the written agreement. Accordingly, I find that there is a cap of $28,000 on the amount of professional fees and disbursements incurred by the Plaintiff in the course of its representation of the Defendant. I also find that this sum includes the costs of all work done by the Plaintiff on the matter, including all drafting work whether prior to or after the filing of the writ of summons, negotiation with opposing counsel and work done in respect of mediation sessions. Accordingly, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application with costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s representation of the Defendant in the KKS Suit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Defendant is a secretary at a law practice, Messrs Lim &amp; Co, which is a sole proprietorship run by Mr Lim Loo Leong (“Mr Lim”).

Even on the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement, the party-and-party costs fixed by the court only related to work done in connection with the KKS Suit, and did not include work done during the pre-writ period and in relation to the SMC mediation.

In support of its interpretation of cl 8, the Plaintiff argues that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 8 further provides that the parties will discuss and agree on any fees to be charged.

</div> The Plaintiff asserts that this indicates that the Defendant’s current position is an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In interpreting the Fee Agreement, the court should prefer a construction which entails that the contract and its performance are lawful (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”) at [131]). The Fee Agreement may be illegal and unenforceable on the Defendant’s interpretation of cl 8 for amounting to a contingent fee arrangement. The Plaintiff cites the Council of the Law Society’s Practice Direction No 2 of 2012 (“the 2012 Practice Directions”), which addresses the impropriety of a particular arrangement under which solicitor-and-client costs and disbursements are limited to whatever party-and-party costs and disbursements are recovered from the other party, and under which the solicitor-and-client costs would be waived and only disbursements billed in the event that no costs are recovered from the other party. The 2012 Practice Directions states at para 3(a) that the Council has taken the position that such a fee arrangement would be improper, as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any fee arrangement that provides for payment of solicitor-and-client costs that is contingent on the amount of party-and-party costs recovered by a client would render a solicitor in breach of s 107 of the Legal Profession Act (“LPA”) and r 37 Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules [1998] because the solicitor would have an interest in the subject matter of the litigation or be purchasing an interest in the client …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff thus submits that the court should not accept the Defendant’s interpretation of cl 8.

If the Defendant’s dispute with KKS had been settled during the pre-writ period, there would have been no costs awarded by the court.

The parties do not dispute that the Fee Agreement amounts to an agreement for costs in respect of contentious business under s 111 of the LPA, or that it is binding (see [25] above). The dispute is really as to whether the Plaintiff is entitled under the Fee Agreement to bill the Defendant for more than $28,000. While the Plaintiff has stated in its written submissions that “the sole issue for the Court’s determination in this application [is] whether the Plaintiff’s or the Defendant’s interpretation of [cl 8] is to be preferred”, the Plaintiff has not included this in its prayers.

Instead, according to the Defendant, the Plaintiff should have either sued her for the payment of the Bill, or applied for an order of taxation under s 120 of the LPA. In the case of the latter, the Plaintiff would have to first advise the Defendant according to rr 17(5) and 17(6) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (GN No S 706 of 2015) (“the 2015 Rules”) of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, her right to apply to court to have the Bill taxed.

The payment of fees to the Plaintiff was not contingent on the Plaintiff’s success in the KKS Suit. “Party-and-party costs” in cl 8 includes costs ordered to be paid by the Defendant, if costs were to have been ordered against her in the KKS Suit. The interpretation of cl 8 to impose a cap on the Plaintiff’s costs according to the amount of party-and-party costs awarded does not contravene s 107(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA which prohibits solicitors from entering into agreements contemplating payment only in the event of success in the litigation, nor the underlying rationale that a solicitor should not be personally interested in the subject matter of the litigation. This is supported by the examples set out in the 2012 Practice Directions. In any event, s 107 is a prohibition against the solicitor, and does not state that any fee agreement that runs afoul of it will be null, void or illegal.

It is clear that ss 111 and 113 apply to the Fee Agreement. Because of this, I see no need to grant any declarations to this effect, which the Plaintiff seeks in its first two prayers (see [24(a)]–[24(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The key issue as to the interpretation of the Fee Agreement amounts to a “question respecting the … effect of the agreement” and therefore falls squarely within s 113(2) of the LPA. As such, it was procedurally proper for the Plaintiff to have filed an application under s 113(2). Although the interpretation issue is not explicitly stated in the Plaintiff’s originating summons, it does indirectly arise from the prayer for an order that the Plaintiff be entitled to tax its costs in accordance with the terms of the Fee Agreement (see [24(c)] above). The Defendant has always clearly known what case she has to meet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As the Plaintiff only seeks an order that it be <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> to tax its costs, rather than the actual taxation of its costs, I do not consider this to be an application for an order for taxation under s 120 of the LPA. That said, I accept that the Plaintiff’s prayer for an order that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff the taxed costs forthwith (see [24(d)] above) does appear misplaced. But in any event, in view of my interpretation of the Fee Agreement, I do not think that any order to this effect will be necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the argument that the Plaintiff may not seek payment of any amount over $31,695.18, I see no justification or authority for finding the Plaintiff to be bound to the amount stated in the Bill. This is especially considering that amount in the Bill was arrived at as a result of the Plaintiff’s attempt to make a compromise with the Defendant. There cannot be estoppel on these facts when the Plaintiff has made no representation that it would refrain from seeking a higher amount or an order for taxation if the Defendant did not agree to the amount under the Bill, and when there has clearly been no detrimental reliance on the Defendant’s part (see <span class="font-italic">The Bunga Melati 5</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1114 at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As none of these objections by the Defendant amount to reasons for dismissing the Plaintiff’s application outright, I will proceed to consider the substantive issues.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Defendant’s actions amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Fee Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I will first briefly deal with the Plaintiff’s alternative argument that the Defendant’s actions amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Fee Agreement. I note that this issue was not seriously canvassed by the Plaintiff, and only arose in the course of oral submissions at the second hearing when I specifically asked the parties about it. No authorities were cited by the parties on the issue of repudiatory breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The legal principles on the right to terminate a contract in view of a repudiatory breach are set out in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”) at [91]–[99] (see also <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic">) v Wong Bark Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 at [153]–[157]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> identified four situations which entitle the innocent party to elect to treat the contact as discharged as a result of the other party’s breach. The first situation is where the contractual term in question clearly and unambiguously provides for the right to terminate the contract upon the occurrence of certain events. The second is where the party in breach renounces the contract and clearly conveys to the innocent party that it will not perform its contractual obligations at all. The third is where the term breached is a condition of the contract. The fourth is where the breach deprives the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended to obtain from the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is clear to me that none of the above situations apply to the present facts. All the Defendant did was to challenge the Plaintiff’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement in their e-mail exchanges, and to assert her own. Especially considering that cl 8 of the Letter of Representation stated that the parties would discuss and agree on the fees to be charged, the Defendant’s actions do not amount to a breach, let alone a repudiatory breach that would allow the Plaintiff to set aside the Fee Agreement. I therefore dismiss the Plaintiff’s claims in the alternative at the outset.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interpretation of the Fee Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plain meaning of cl 8</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I now turn to the main issue of how the Fee Agreement – in particular, cl 8 – should be interpreted. I start with the text of cl 8, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In view of the fact that your matter was referred to us by Mr. Lim Loo Leong, we will cap any charges in this matter (other than disbursements) at the level of party and party costs. Prior to issuing any bills, we will discuss and agree on any charges to be levied as professional costs. Any disbursements will be billed as and when incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, a plain reading of cl 8 supports the interpretation put forward by the Defendant. The reference to a “cap” indicates a ceiling or maximum limit, which accords with the Defendant’s interpretation. The Plaintiff’s interpretation on the other hand does not involve the same notion of an absolute or determinable maximum amount, only the question of what basis on which the costs should be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The literal wording in the phrase “party and party costs” also points in favour of the Defendant’s interpretation, which is simply that costs are to be capped at the amount of party-and-party costs awarded. If the Plaintiff meant that costs would be assessed on a standard basis, it is puzzling why it did not simply say so instead. One would also expect a brief explanation to the client as to what “costs on a standard basis” means, and how that relates to party-and-party costs. No such explanation was provided in the Letter of Representation. I note that party-and-party costs are usually assessed on a standard basis, but not always (see O 59 r 27(3) of the ROC). The Plaintiff’s interpretation thus relies on a questionable assumption equating party-and-party costs to costs on a standard basis, and this was also not explained in the Letter of Representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 While the Plaintiff raises the fact that cl 8 mentions the “usual charge-out rates” of its lawyers, I am unable to see how this detracts from the Defendant’s interpretation. The hourly rates of the Plaintiff’s lawyers apart from Mr Chacko are still relevant and would still be assessed as usual, up until the “cap” amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Similarly, the requirement that the parties “discuss and agree” on the charges does not advance the Plaintiff’s interpretation, as it simply appears to be a courtesy extended by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a client. As the Defendant argues, such a clause would also cover situations where the court has not made any order as to party-and-party costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I note also that the printed “Standard Terms of Appointment” set out on the reverse side of the Warrant to Act contains a section on “Fees” which concludes with the statement, “Where possible we will give you an estimate of our fees.” Clause 8 of the Letter of Representation states that since the matter was referred to the Plaintiff by Mr Lim, charges in that matter (other than disbursements) were capped at the level of party-and-party costs. There is nothing in the standard terms on fees which is inconsistent with the interpretation that cl 8 sets out a hard cap pegged to the party-and-party costs awarded. The cap on fees is set at “the level of party and party costs” and not expressed in terms of limiting the fees to the sum chargeable “at the standard rate of assessment”. The use of the words “cap” and “level” and the absence of any explanation or reference to “standard rate of assessment” make it clear that what was intended was a hard cap pegged to the actual party-and-party costs awarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The fact that the Defendant was a secretary at a law firm and had the assistance of Mr Lim does not make any difference. The solicitor is bound to provide a clear explanation of the fees chargeable to the client, and I make some further observations on this at [68]–[71] below. The Letter of Representation and the Warrant to Act form the contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The provision on fees relates to the fees which the Plaintiff as solicitor is entitled to charge the Defendant as client. Party-and-party costs, on the other hand, are about the costs payable (ordinarily) by the losing party to the winning party. It is against this backdrop that my decision was reached. I shall turn to the position where no party-and-party costs at all are awarded, at [63]–[66] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having found the Defendant’s interpretation to be consonant with the plain meaning of the Fee Agreement, I shall now consider whether there are any reasons why the Plaintiff’s interpretation or any other interpretation should be preferred. I briefly note at the outset that I do not give much weight to the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendant had failed to mention her interpretation of the Fee Agreement to Mr Chacko at their meeting on 1 April 2016, and only did so later when the Plaintiff proposed rendering her an invoice of $70,000. There are many reasons why the Defendant might have initially omitted to raise this to Mr Chacko, and it does not exert much influence on my interpretation of the meaning of the Fee Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant’s interpretation would make the Fee Agreement unlawful or improper</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Fee Agreement would amount to a contingent fee arrangement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Plaintiff takes the position that if the Defendant’s interpretation was accepted, the Fee Agreement would amount to a contingent fee arrangement prohibited under s 107(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. I disagree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Section 107(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA provides that no solicitor shall:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">enter into any agreement by which he is retained or employed to prosecute any suit or action or other contentious proceeding which stipulates for or contemplates payment only in the event of success in that suit, action or proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Defendant, however, does not posit that costs would only be payable if party-and-party costs were awarded in her favour. Instead, she takes the position that regardless of her success or failure in the KKS Suit, she would have to pay costs capped at the amount of party-and-party costs awarded to <span class="font-italic">either party</span>. This does not contravene the wording or spirit of s 107(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which prohibits fee arrangements that are contingent on the client’s success in the proceedings, thereby preventing lawyers from having a stake in the litigation or purchasing an interest in the client (see the 2012 Practice Directions, para 3(a)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Next, r 18 of the 2015 Rules provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A legal practitioner or law practice must not enter into any negotiations with a client of the legal practitioner or law practice —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) for an interest in the subject matter of litigation or of any other contentious proceedings; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) except to the extent permitted by any applicable scale of costs, for remuneration proportionate to the amount which may be recovered by the client in the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Rule 18 of the 2015 Rules is closely similar in form and substance to r 37 in the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 1998 (GN No S 156 of 1998, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the 1998 Rules”), which was the version of the Rules in force prior to the 2015 amendments at the time that the Letter of Representation was sent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It may appear at first glance that r 18(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 2015 Rules might be relevant, considering that the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement would make the Plaintiff’s costs somewhat proportionate to (or at least capped by) the amount of party-and-party costs ordered by the court. However, a significant difference is that r 18(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) refers to “remuneration proportionate to the amount which may be recovered <span class="font-italic">by the client</span> in the proceedings” [emphasis added]. As mentioned at [53] above, the Defendant’s interpretation is that the amount of party-and-party costs awarded will serve as a cap regardless of whether the costs were awarded in favour of the Defendant or the KKS side. On this view, the prohibition in r 18(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This is made clearer by the illustrations in the 2012 Practice Directions, which were incorporated into the Council of the Law Society’s Practice Directions 2013 at para 58C. The 2012 Practice Directions at para 2 sets out the situation where a lawyer’s costs and disbursements are limited to the party-and-party costs and disbursements “recovered from the other party”, and where the lawyer’s costs would be waived if no such costs are recovered from the other side. Unsurprisingly, the 2012 Practice Directions stated that such an arrangement would be improper under s 107 of the LPA and r 37 of the 1998 Rules. However, for the reasons already mentioned, the present situation is quite different from what is envisioned in the 2012 Practice Directions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there would be a conflict of interest for the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the Plaintiff’s further submissions, it advances the further argument that even if the Fee Agreement is not prohibited for being a contingent fee arrangement under the Defendant’s interpretation, it would at least amount to a conflict of interest on the Plaintiff’s part that is prohibited under r 22(4) of the 2015 Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Rule 22(4) of the 2015 Rules provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a law practice has an interest in any matter entrusted to it by its client —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  in any case where the interest is adverse to the client’s interests, the law practice must withdraw from representing the client, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the law practice makes a full and frank disclosure of the adverse interest to the client;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the law practice advises the client to obtain independent legal advice;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) if the client does not obtain independent legal advice, the law practice ensures that the client is not under an impression that the law practice is protecting the client’s interests; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) despite sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii), the client gives the client’s informed consent in writing to the law practice acting, or continuing to act, on the client’s behalf; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in any other case, the law practice must withdraw from representing the client, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the law practice makes a full and frank disclosure of the interest to the client; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) despite sub-paragraph (i), the client gives the client’s informed consent in writing to the law practice acting, or continuing to act, on the client’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This rule corresponds to r 27 of the 1998 Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Plaintiff essentially argues that it would have been placed in a position of conflict if the Defendant had lost the KKS Suit and had to pay costs to the KKS side, as it would have been in the Plaintiff’s interests (and contrary to the Defendant’s) to submit a high figure for costs before the SAR so as to receive a higher amount of fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I acknowledge the Plaintiff’s point. However, this position of conflict did not actually materialise in this case, as the Defendant was awarded costs in the KKS Suit. If it became likely that the Defendant would be ordered to pay costs, it might then have been prudent for the Plaintiff to provide full and frank disclosure, advise the Defendant to obtain independent legal advice, and obtain the client’s informed written consent to the Plaintiff acting for her in the costs hearing before the SAR, as stipulated under r 22(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). But the possibility of potential conflict at the costs hearing (a small part of the Plaintiff’s overall representation of the Defendant) later down the line, and requiring the Plaintiff to satisfy certain conditions to submit for costs on the Defendant’s behalf in such an event, do not render the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement illegal or improper in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Moreover, I have some hesitations about reading r 22(4) so broadly as to include all potential conflicts regarding the amount of legal fees that may be earned from the client. For instance, lawyers often advise their clients as to whether to appeal, and it could equally be said that a lawyer would be faced with a conflict between advising his client to pursue the appeal which would generate more fees in the lawyer’s own interest, or acting in the client’s interests by advising him not to pursue an unmeritorious appeal. In such situations, it seems preferable to rely on other ethical obligations and provisions in the LPA and the 2015 Rules, such as the lawyer’s duty to be honest to the client and to act in his interests under r 5 of the 2015 Rules. It may be too broad to read such situations as falling within r 22(4) as matters “[w]here a law practice has an interest in any matter entrusted to it by its client”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In short, I am not satisfied that the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement would be illegal or improper, whether because it would amount to a contingent fee arrangement or a conflict of interest. Further, as the Defendant submits, the provisions cited by the Plaintiff are ethical obligations for legal practitioners, and do not suggest that any fee arrangement in contravention of any such prohibitions would be void or unenforceable, especially not where the legal practitioner seeks to avoid the fee arrangement to his benefit. I accept that these considerations can nonetheless inform the court’s interpretation of the fee agreement in the appropriate circumstances, but on these facts, I do not find the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement to be illegal or improper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant’s interpretation would lead to an unreasonable result</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement would lead to an unreasonable result in situations where the court does not award party-and-party costs. The Plaintiff cites the example that if the Defendant’s dispute with KKS had been settled during the pre-writ period, the Plaintiff would not have been entitled to bill the Defendant any costs at all, and would have been out-of-pocket in such a situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I do not consider the outcome of the Plaintiff’s cited example to be unreasonable. It is apparent under the Fee Agreement that the Plaintiff was extending the Defendant a favour and a preferential rate “[i]n view of the fact that [her] matter was referred to [the Plaintiff] by Mr. Lim Loo Leong”. The Plaintiff had also agreed to waive all of Mr Chacko’s fees in the matter. If the dispute had been settled even prior to the formal commencement of the KKS Suit, it is not altogether unreasonable to expect that the Plaintiff would have been willing to waive any costs (other than disbursements) that had been incurred to date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Furthermore, the “discuss and agree” part of cl 8 would operate in all other situations where party-and-party costs are not awarded by the court. I add that given the absence of any order as to party-and-party costs in such situations, it seems that there would simply be no cap within the meaning of cl 8, such that costs could be taxed as usual if the parties were unable to reach an agreement after discussion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the above reasons, I do not see any reason to depart from the plain meaning of cl 8 on the basis that such an interpretation would lead to an unreasonable result.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other observations on the interpretation of the Fee Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In any case, even if there are any ambiguities in the terms of the Fee Agreement that cannot be resolved, the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span> rule will apply such that a viable interpretation that is against the interests of the draftsman is to be preferred (see <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1083 at [51]). As the Letter of Representation was drafted by the Plaintiff, any unresolvable ambiguities should be interpreted in favour of the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 On the present facts, I further note that this was not an ordinary contractual agreement where parties negotiated terms at arm’s length and on equal footing. The Plaintiff is a law firm that was representing the Defendant as its client. Law firms have a duty to exercise utmost scrupulousness when entering into agreements with their clients who are unlikely to have separate legal representation. This is why rr 17(3) to 17(4) of the 2015 Rules place firm obligations on legal practitioners to inform their clients at the outset about the fees for professional services to be charged, and to provide the necessary explanations so that clients can fully understand how they will be charged. These rules correspond to rr 35 and 36 of the 1998 Rules, which were in force at the time that the Letter of Representation was sent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The onus should be on law firms to make their fee agreements clear and unambiguous, and it would be an improper and unsatisfactory outcome if law firms could simply take undue advantage of ambiguities in their fee agreements by insisting on their interpretation of the fees at the close of the solicitor-client relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As stated in Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015</span><span class="font-italic">: A Commentary </span>(Academy Publishing, 2016) at para 17.021, “the client must be fully informed so that he is absolutely clear about the extent of his actual or potential liability for fees and expenses related to the retainer”. In this regard, the learned author rightly states at para 17.023, “Where the fees are agreed between a lawyer and his client, the amount must not be increased unilaterally by the lawyer unless the agreement clearly provides for such an eventuality in the event that the circumstances change or new work needs to be done.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For example, in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Joseph Chen Kok Siang</span> [2016] SGDT 4, the engagement provided payment of $8,000 for work to be done (as set out in the letter) and for any party-and-party costs that were payable by the defendants to be paid to the client. The matter had been set down for eight days (although the lawyer claimed that he was unaware of this). The lawyer subsequently rendered an invoice for $35,000 in legal costs. The disciplinary tribunal ruled that the lawyer had agreed to the fees and that he was not entitled to raise the amount without the agreement of the client even if the solicitor “had underestimated the time and effort required for that agreed scope of work”. The tribunal’s observations on terms on agreed or capped fees bear setting out:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This case illustrates the importance of having clear fee arrangements which reflect the course of litigation, and the consequent work to be done. Clients increasingly ask solicitors for agreed or capped fees. In setting out agreed or capped fees in their engagement, solicitors should:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Clearly identify the stage of the work that such agreed or capped fees apply to;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Set out the agreed or capped fees for each stage, so that the effect of any unexpected event does not impact on the fees to be charged beyond that stage;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Clearly identify the circumstances in which the agreed or capped fee arrangement can be changed and the process for change and notification.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)  Use clear, simple and unambiguous language in communicating with the client, particularly in matters involving fees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 While I have already found in favour of the Defendant’s interpretation of the Fee Agreement based on a plain reading and the surrounding context, I note that this finding is one that accords with public policy and the ethical obligations of lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether costs for pre-writ and mediation work fell within the party-and-party costs ordered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having found that the professional fees payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff under the Fee Agreement are to be capped at the amount of party-and-party costs ordered by the court, I now consider the question of what the $28,000 figure ordered by the SAR at the PTC really entails. In particular, parties disagree over whether costs incurred as a result of work done by the plaintiff during the pre-writ period and in respect of the SMC mediation are to fall within the $28,000 sum or to be taxed separately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I set out the relevant parts of the SAR’s notes of evidence of the PTC, where the abbreviations “DC”, “PC” and “CT” stand for KKS’ counsel, Ms Chan-Richard and the SAR respectively:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">DC: My client’s basic position is as stated in the last PTC (ie, that the acceptance of Offer to Settle is in full and final settlement of all claims including costs) but they will be willing to pay reasonable costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">PC: Parties spoke outside and agree for Your Honour to fix costs. 1 round of discovery done and copies of documents exchanged.

There were 70 documents in our List of Documents and 94 on my learned friend’s List.

Indeed, the Plaintiff did not really press this argument hard during oral submissions, and its only argument is that the Costs Guidelines do not make any reference to pre-writ work. But the Costs Guidelines are certainly not meant to comprehensively set out all the work that may be taken into consideration by the court in awarding costs. Moreover, the Costs Guidelines at part III(A)(ii) specify a range for party-and-party costs for matters that are settled at the close of pleadings ($5,000 to $20,000). If work done in the preparation of pleadings cannot be considered by the court in awarding costs, it is puzzling what these suggested costs would constitute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The court’s discretion in awarding costs under O 59 r 2(2) of the ROC covers “costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court”. I accept that the costs incurred by the Plaintiff in the drafting and preparation of the writ of summons and the statement of claim in the KKS Suit are “incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court”. That said, the question of whether work done in respect of negotiations is similarly “incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court” is a trickier matter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Communications and negotiations with KKS</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Order 59 r 31(1) of the ROC states that Appendix 1 to O 59 (on costs on taxation) is applicable to the taxation of all costs with respect to “contentious business”, subject to rr 1 to 30. “Contentious business” is in turn defined in O 59 r 1(1) of the ROC read with s 2(1) of the LPA as “business done in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court of justice or before an arbitrator”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The definition of “contentious business” in s 2(1) of the LPA is largely similar to that in s 87(1) of the Solicitors Act 1974 (c 47) (UK) (“the UK Solicitors Act 1974”), which includes the similar phrase “in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court or before an arbitrator”. The Defendant cites <span class="font-italic">Bilkus v Stockler Brunton (a firm) </span>[2010] 1 WLR 2526, wherein the English Court of Appeal held at [44] that “[w]ork ‘for the purposes of proceedings’ may be carried out before the proceedings are begun (taking instructions, writing a letter before claim, obtaining evidence and so on)”. Such work, unlike work done after the completion of the proceedings, falls within the definition of “contentious business”. In the same vein, it is clear to me here that the work done by the Plaintiff in the pre-writ period amounts to “contentious business” and that Appendix 1 to O 59 of the ROC should therefore apply. Paragraph 2(6) of Appendix 1 then makes clear that “[w]ork done in the cause or matter includes work done in connection with the negotiation of a settlement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81  More generally, the Defendant also cites the English decision of <span class="font-italic">In re Simpkin Marshall Ltd </span>[1958] 1 Ch 229 (“<span class="font-italic">Simpkin</span>”) at 235–236 for the proposition that all business “done before proceedings are begun provided that the business is done with a view to the proceedings being begun, and they are in fact begun” fall within the definition of “contentious business”. While <span class="font-italic">Simpkin</span> preceded the UK Solicitors Act 1974, the earlier 1957 version of that Act contained the same phrase “in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court or before an arbitrator” (see s 86(1) of the Solicitors Act 1957 (c 27) (UK)), which the court in <span class="font-italic">Simpkin</span> focused on (at 233). In the present case, the negotiations with KKS were indeed in view of the KKS Suit that was later begun. Nonetheless, I do note that this proposition in <span class="font-italic">Simpkin</span> was strictly <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, as on the unique facts of that case, no proceedings had begun in respect of the matters advised on by the solicitors apart from compulsory winding up proceedings that had already been commenced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 <span class="font-italic">Pinsler on Civil Procedure</span> does, however, clearly state the following at p 1024:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although Order 59 of the Rules of Court is entitled “Costs”, it is primarily concerned with costs related to contentious work, which is described as “business done, whether as solicitor or as advocate, in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court of justice or before an arbitrator”. <span class="font-italic">This includes the work performed prior to the commencement of proceedings for the purpose of the impending proceedings. Furthermore, the time which a lawyer puts into the negotiations for a settlement is regarded as being part of his court work.</span> If the case is settled prior to the commencement of court proceedings, the work would be classified as non-contentious.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; internal footnotes omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the footnotes to the above passage, the learned author cited O 59 r 31(1) of the ROC, Appendix 1 to O 59 and <span class="font-italic">Simpkin</span>. The Plaintiff, however, contends that the above propositions in <span class="font-italic">Pinsler on Civil Procedure</span> were made in the context of discussing solicitor-and-client costs, not party-and-party costs, which are the issue at hand.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Indeed, in Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2017</span>, Vol II (LexisNexis, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span>”) at para 59/28/1, the learned author makes the same point in reference to O 59 r 28, which is on costs payable to a solicitor by his own client. While I acknowledge that the two English cases were both concerned with solicitor-and-client costs, and that the above passage in <span class="font-italic">Pinsler on Civil Procedure</span> was preceded by discussion on solicitor-and-client costs, I see no cogent reason why these principles should not apply to party-and-party costs as well. Nothing in O 59 r 31(1), Appendix 1 to O 59, or s 2(1) of the LPA on the definition of “contentious business” states that these provisions only apply when solicitor-and-client costs are being considered. Instead, these provisions are framed to apply generally to the ascertainment of costs on taxation by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> Court Practice</span> at para 59/31/3 states, with reference to O 59 r 31, that “the [taxing] registrar’s objective is to ensure that the amount of costs to be paid to the receiving party, <span class="font-italic">whether in a party and party or solicitor and own client taxation</span>, is just and fair in all the circumstances” [emphasis added]. It goes on to explain, with reference to O 59 r 2, that the party receiving costs is only allowed the costs of and incidental to any proceedings, and cites <span class="font-italic">Re Gibson’s Settlement Trusts</span> [1981] 2 WLR 1 at 7, in which Sir Robert Megarry V-C held that costs incurred as part of the preparation for negotiations which are relevant to the proceedings may well be incidental to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For the above reasons, I find that it would have been proper for the SAR to have taken into account all of the pre-writ work done by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">“Without prejudice” negotiations</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 A corollary and significant issue that has arisen with regard to the work done by the Plaintiff in the negotiations to settle the dispute with KKS is whether the SAR could have taken into account the “without prejudice” negotiations between the parties in the KKS Suit when awarding party-and-party costs. The Plaintiff argues that in the absence of a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a letter marked “without prejudice save as to costs” (see <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as Singapore Bus Services Limited) v Koh Swee Ann</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 365 (“<span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span>”) at [2] and [16], referring to <span class="font-italic">Calderbank v Calderbank</span> [1976] Fam 93), it could not have raised the existence of these negotiations to the SAR. Accordingly, the Plaintiff takes the position that the $28,000 sum ordered by the SAR could not have included any work done by the Plaintiff on the negotiations with KKS, at least some of which was expressly stated to be “without prejudice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Plaintiff cites two cases.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span>, the appellant offered to settle the respondent’s potential claim for damages through a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter, which the respondent did not accept. The respondent also did not accept two subsequent formal offers to settle made by the appellant. The matter went to trial, and the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent damages and costs. The appellant was dissatisfied with the costs order, and contended that the respondent was not entitled to costs as the judgment sum awarded in the respondent’s favour was lower than the amount that was offered in the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter. The Court of Appeal found that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal for other reasons, but remarked at [24] that a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter can be a relevant factor if the result of litigation is less favourable to the litigant than the offer in the letter.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second case that the Plaintiff cites is <span class="font-italic">Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 (“<span class="font-italic">Shi Fang</span>”), a family law case the facts of which are not relevant for our present purposes. When the Court of Appeal turned to the question of costs to be awarded, it noted at [54] that the judge below had taken into account a “without prejudice” offer of $230,000 made by the husband to the wife in settlement of all of her claims, and later offers of $150,000 and $170,000 made on a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> basis. The judge below noted that the $230,000 “without prejudice” offer was very close to the $240,000 lump sum maintenance that the wife had ultimately received. The Court of Appeal remarked at [55] that the judge below should not have taken into account the husband’s “without prejudice” offer, which was inadmissible on the question of costs. On the other hand, it was permissible for the judge below to have considered the two subsequent offers made in the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letters which were substantially below the amount that was awarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, neither <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span> nor <span class="font-italic">Shi Fang</span> advances the Plaintiff’s argument here. <span class="font-italic">SBS Transit</span> simply stands for the proposition that an offer under a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter can be considered by the court in its determination of the costs to be awarded. The Court of Appeal’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Shi Fang</span> should not be read so widely as to suggest that the very existence of negotiations between parties cannot be raised to the court in its determination of costs, even when the substance of the negotiations and the offers made by either party are kept confidential. The Plaintiff did not have to disclose any details about any “without prejudice” negotiations between the parties to the KKS Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I, therefore, do not accept that the SAR could not have considered costs incurred in respect of work done in respect of negotiations to settle the KKS Suit, whether or not the negotiations were conducted “without prejudice”. In any event, it appears from the schedule of services rendered by the Plaintiff to the Defendant

There was nothing before me to suggest that all of the correspondence and meetings were meant to have been “without prejudice”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Work done in respect of the SMC mediation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The final issue is whether the work done by the Plaintiff in respect of the mediation could have been taken into account by the SAR in awarding party-and-party costs to the Defendant. I note that this does not include the costs of the SMC mediation sessions itself, which were already borne by the Defendant by way of about $17,000 to the SMC (see [12] above). This is a close question in my view, as none of the authorities cited by the parties are illuminating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Plaintiff cites <span class="font-italic">Bobby Chin</span>, a case in which the respondent commenced fresh proceedings in the High Court to recover the costs of an arbitration against a company that had gone into receivership. The Court of Appeal held at [31] that the respondent should not have done so, as the proper procedure was to apply to the arbitral tribunal for an order of costs instead. First, O 59 r 2(2) of the ROC (which the respondent had relied on) does not create an independent cause of action under which a party may bring an action to sue for costs of earlier proceedings that had been awarded in his favour (at [26]). The second reason identified by the Court of Appeal at [27] may be more pertinent:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second flaw in the respondents’ reasoning was that a careful reading of O 59 r 2(2) would reveal that the provision is confined to “costs of and incidental to proceedings in the Supreme Court or the [State] Courts”. <span class="font-italic">It therefore does not apply to costs of non-court proceedings</span>, such as arbitration proceedings. Order 59 r 2(2) therefore does not confer upon the courts the power to order costs of arbitration proceedings, as it may for court proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Plaintiff emphasises the Court of Appeal’s remark that O 59 r 2(2) “does not apply to costs of non-court proceedings”, which the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> interpret to include mediation and arbitration proceedings (at para 59/2/1). However, I am hesitant about whether the Court of Appeal means that O 59 r 2(2) does not apply to work done in respect of mediation under these circumstances before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The circumstances in <span class="font-italic">Bobby Chin</span> are distinguishable in that there were no existing court proceedings there, only arbitration proceedings. Here, in contrast, there were existing litigation proceedings in the Supreme Court, and the costs from work done in respect of the mediation to settle the KKS Suit could reasonably be described as “incidental to” these court proceedings, within the meaning of O 59 r 2(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Court of Appeal further noted at [28] that s 6 of and the First Schedule to the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed) conferred upon arbitrators a wide discretion to award costs. This is not the case with mediators, who do not have any discretion to award costs. On the present facts, it appears that the parties to the KKS Suit did not make any provision in their settlement as to who should bear the costs of the work done for the mediation, and were content to simply submit the matter of costs in general to be decided by the courts. The thrust of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in respect of arbitration proceedings does not pertain to mediation in the same way. I would, therefore, be slow to interpret its <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> about “non-court proceedings” in general as being intended to apply to costs incurred from work done in respect of mediation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Furthermore, having decided at [79]–[84] above that costs from negotiation work can be taken into account in the award of party-and-party costs, it would be a somewhat unsatisfactory position if certain negotiation work were excluded simply because it was conducted under the auspices of the SMC mediation. I reiterate that mediators at the SMC do not have the discretion to award costs, and that my decision does not extend to fees that are charged by the SMC or other mediation bodies. The type of work done by the lawyers when negotiating to reach settlement is still very much the same, and the reasoning and provisions on negotiation work (for example, Appendix 1 to O 59, para 2(6)) should similarly apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For completeness, I note that Defendant makes an argument based on O 59 r 5(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC, which requires the court, in exercising its discretion as to costs, to take into account the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation, where appropriate. This rule refers to the court taking into account the parties’ <span class="font-italic">conduct</span> in attempting to settle the case, and not the costs of the work for mediation. As such, I have not placed much weight on this rule in coming to my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In summary, I find that all of the work done by the Plaintiff on the KKS matter, including drafting and negotiation work done pre-writ, and work done in respect of mediation work, could have been taken into consideration by the SAR when awarding party-and-party costs at the PTC. I, therefore, take the $28,000 sum awarded by the SAR to include all of these costs, including disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Even if I am wrong in my finding that the SAR could take into account any of these costs, I note that the cap on charges in cl 8 was drafted very widely. I refer back to the wording of the first sentence of cl 8:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In view of the fact that your matter was referred to us by Mr. Lim Loo Leong, we will cap <span class="font-italic">any charges in this matter</span> (other than disbursements) at the level of party and party costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clause 8 clearly refers to “any charges in this matter”. It is clear that the “matter” in question refers to the entire dispute between the Defendant and KKS. The point has been made that the standard terms on fees in the “Standard Terms of Appointment” includes specific reference to the nature and duration of hearings and/or trials in court, arbitration or mediation proceedings. It is clear that the Letter of Representation and the standard terms envisaged or anticipated that a variety of types of work might be undertaken, including work to settle the matter through mediation. As noted, the provisions on fees relate to the fees which the Plaintiff as solicitor is entitled to charge the Defendant as client. Party-and-party costs, on the other hand, are about the costs payable (ordinarily) by the losing party to the winning party. The discussion of what items fall within party-and-party costs at taxation and the extent to which the items (such as pre-writ work and work done to settle a suit through mediation) could have been taken into account in and for the purposes of party-and-party taxation, is part of the backdrop against which cl 8 of the Letter of Representation is to be interpreted. I, therefore, interpret the Fee Agreement to mean that the cap of $28,000 applies to <span class="font-italic">all</span> charges payable, <span class="font-italic">including any charges for</span><span class="font-italic"> drafting, negotiation and mediation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Finally, cl 8 states that the cap on the charges payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff does not include any disbursements. However, the $28,000 figure awarded by the SAR was an “all in” figure that was inclusive of disbursements. I, therefore, find that under the Fee Agreement, the Defendant is only required to pay the Plaintiff up to the total amount of $28,000, which includes both professional fees and disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the above reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application. The Plaintiff may only charge the Defendant up to $28,000 in professional fees and disbursements for work done in respect of the Defendant’s dispute with KKS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 It follows that the Plaintiff is to pay the costs of this application to the Defendant, which may be offset against the amount to be paid by the Defendant in respect of the professional fees and disbursements. I shall hear the parties if they are unable to agree on the amount of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Shack Keong and Anne-Marie John (Legis Point LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Bachoo Mohan Singh and Too Xing Ji (Bachoo Mohan Singh Law Practice) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
