        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction and facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) who had refused to grant the
                    defendants a stay of the action brought against them by the plaintiff (see
                        <em>Mineral Enterprises Ltd v JIO Minerals FZC and
                        others</em> [2010] SGHC 109).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge, the
                    defendants appealed. After hearing counsel, we allowed the appeal. We now give
                    the detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mineral Enterprises Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”) is the plaintiff. It is an Indian company with expertise in
                    mining and marketing iron ore in India and internationally. The Respondent has
                    projects in Indonesia which are coordinated by its Mining and Operations
                    Manager, Joseph Cyriac (“Cyriac”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       JIO Minerals FZC (“the First
                    Appellant”) is a company incorporated in the United Arab Emirates
                    (“UAE”) and was set up by Jimmy Singh (“the Second
                    Appellant”) and Raman Srinivasan (“the Third Appellant”).
                    The First, Second and Third Appellants are the defendants and we will refer to
                    them collectively as “the Appellants”. The Second Appellant is the
                    President and Director of an Indonesian company known as PT JIO Energi
                    Resources (“PT JIO”). The Second Appellant is also a
                    commercial licensee and manager of the First Appellant. PT JIO owns iron
                    ore mining concessions in 12 hectares of land in Pelaihari, Kalimantan
                    (“the Pelaihari Concession”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Third Appellant is a commercial licensee of
                    the First Appellant. Although it was suggested that the Third Appellant had
                    control over PT JIO, together with the Second Appellant, the exact nature
                    of the Third Appellant’s association with PT JIO was not addressed by
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Initial Meetings in Indonesia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Cyriac met the Second and Third Appellants in
                    Indonesia around August 2005. At this first meeting, Cyriac told the Second and
                    Third Appellants that the Respondent was interested in mining iron ore in
                    Indonesia. The Second and Third Appellants told Cyriac that a company that they
                    controlled, PT JIO, had mining concessions in Pelaihari,
                Kalimantan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Cyriac later visited the Pelaihari Concession.
                    The outcome of this visit is disputed. The Appellants’ version is that
                    Cyriac assessed that the Pelaihari Concession contained approximately 300,000 to
                    500,000 tonnes of iron ore and that Cyriac communicated this assessment to
                    the Respondent’s directors. The Respondent’s version was that Cyriac
                    did not explore the Pelaihari Concession because the Appellants did not provide
                    sufficient facilities and logistical arrangements for Cyriac to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Singapore Joint Venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 7 April 2006, the Respondent entered
                    into a joint venture agreement (“the Singapore JVA”) with JIO
                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“JIO Singapore”), a Singapore company. The
                    Second Appellant was the majority shareholder and a director of JIO
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Singapore JVA provided for the incorporation
                    of a joint venture company in Singapore. JIO Singapore was to procure marketing
                    rights over at least 1 million tonnes of iron ore from Indonesia for the
                    joint venture company. The Respondent and JIO Singapore were to have an equal
                    number of shares in the joint venture company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Singapore JVA stipulated Singapore law as
                    its governing law and included both a Singapore International Arbitration Centre
                    arbitration clause and a forum selection clause for the Singapore
                courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After an amendment on 9 May 2006 to the
                    Singapore JVA’s payment provisions, the Singapore JVA was, however, not
                    pursued further. The Respondent’s director, H R Jain, deposed in
                    his affidavit dated 18 January 2010 that the Singapore JVA was not
                    pursued because of “the more advantageous income tax benefits” of
                    forming the joint venture vehicle in the UAE instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     JIO Singapore was struck off the register of
                    companies in Singapore on 4 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Visits to the Tanah Bumbu Concession</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     From February to August 2006, the
                    Respondent’s representatives visited a mining concession in Tanah Bumbu,
                    Kalimantan (the “Tanah Bumbu Concession”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Second Appellant deposed in his affidavit
                    dated 23 November 2009 that two representatives of the local government in
                    charge of the Tanah Bumbu Concession were aware of these visits by the
                    Respondent’s representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Exclusive Mining Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 2 August 2006, the UAE Government of
                    Ajman issued a commercial license to the First Appellant. Shortly thereafter, on
                    7 August 2006, the First Appellant entered into an agreement with
                    PT JIO. This agreement was termed an “Exclusive Irrevocable
                    Exploration, Exploitation, Mining and Marketing Agreement” (“the
                    Exclusive Mining Agreement”). Under the Exclusive Mining Agreement,
                    PT JIO appointed the First Appellant as “its sole and exclusive
                    international agent with irrevocable rights of exploration, exploitation, mining
                    and marketing of Iron Ore Concession [<em>sic</em>]”. The Exclusive Mining Agreement did not define the term
                    “Iron Ore Concession”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Under Article 5.1 of the Exclusive Mining
                    Agreement, however, PT JIO represented that it had iron ore concessions
                    with an estimated reserve of 1 million tonnes of “+65 Fe iron
                    ore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Exclusive Mining Agreement selected the
                    laws of Ajman, UAE, as its governing law. The Exclusive Mining Agreement
                    provided for disputes in connection with it to be resolved “under the
                    rules of the UAE International Arbitration [<em>sic</em>]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 7 September 2006, PT JIO sent the
                    Respondent a copy of the Exclusive Mining Agreement via email. PT JIO sent
                    the copy from Indonesia and the copy was received by the Respondent in
                    India.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meetings in Indonesia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Respondent’s representatives had
                    meetings and negotiations with the Second and Third Appellants in Indonesia in
                    or around August 2006. The outcome of the meetings is material to the dispute
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     According to the Appellants, the Respondent
                    and the Appellants had agreed that the Pelaihari Concession was to be used as a
                    “pilot project”. The Appellants further allege that the parties
                    agreed that the Appellants would procure mining concessions with iron ore
                    deposits of 1 million tonnes. In procuring these iron ore deposits, the
                    Appellants were <em>not</em> to be limited to the Pelaihari
                    Concession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to the Respondent, the outcome of
                    the meetings was that the Respondent was to be given a first right of refusal
                    for all other concessions that the Appellants held and that the Pelaihari
                    Concession was to be the first project for the parties. The Respondent further
                    alleged that the Appellants assured it at the meetings that they had control
                    over the Tanah Bumbu Concession and could bring that concession within the scope
                    of the joint venture that the parties intended to enter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Letter of Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 7 September 2006, the First Appellant
                    sent a letter of offer to the Respondent (“the Letter of Offer”).
                    The Second Appellant signed the Letter of Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The material terms of the Letter of Offer were
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     The First Appellant offered the
                        Respondent 50% shareholding in the First Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     The First Appellant represented that
                        it “has a high grade iron ore reserve of 1 million tones
                            [<em>sic</em>]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Letter of Offer was sent from Indonesia.
                    The Respondent received the Letter of Offer in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cyriac’s Assessment of the Tanah Bumbu Concession</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Cyriac visited the Tanah Bumbu Concession
                    around the time when the First Appellant sent the Letter of Offer to the
                    Respondent. After the visit, Cyriac made a written report (“the Cyriac
                    Report”) that stated that the Tanah Bumbu Concession had approximately 5
                    to 6 million tonnes of iron ore deposits. The Cyriac Report was dated
                    14 September 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellants argued that the Respondent only
                    accepted the Letter of Offer after it received the Cyriac Report. In contrast,
                    the Respondent argued that it was not aware of the contents of the Cyriac Report
                    before it accepted the Letter of Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment of Consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Respondent accepted the offer in the
                    Letter of Offer by paying the requisite consideration (“the Investment
                    Funds”) to the bank accounts of the Second and Third Appellants in
                    Singapore on 27 September 2006. We will refer to the resulting contract
                    between the parties as the “Investment Agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Second and Third Appellants then
                    transferred 30 and 20 shares, respectively, in the First Appellant to the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s drilling activities at the Pelaihari
                Concession</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Respondent started drilling at the
                    Pelaihari Concession some time after the Investment Agreement was concluded. The
                    exact date when the Respondent’s drilling commenced and the extent of the
                    Respondent’s drilling activities are, however, disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellants alleged that the
                    Respondent’s drilling activities were insufficient for it to form a firm
                    view on the amount of iron ore deposits in the Pelaihari Concession. The
                    Appellants alleged that representatives of the local government in charge of the
                    Pelaihari Concession witnessed the Respondent’s drilling activities and
                    would be able to give evidence on those activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Partial Repayment of the Investment Funds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellants returned the Respondent a sum
                    of US$699,000. The purpose of this repayment is disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Appellants argued that the sum was
                    returned because they felt that they had no choice but to return the unutilised
                    portion of the Investment Funds because the Respondent was not going to restart
                    drilling. The Appellants further argued that they did not agree to return the
                    balance of the Investment Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Respondent alleged that the Appellants
                    returned that sum because they admitted that the Pelaihari Concession did not
                    contain sufficient deposits. The Respondent also argued that the Appellants
                    promised to return the balance of the Investment Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On 19 February 2009, the Respondent
                    commenced proceedings against the Appellants in the Singapore High Court for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that the Respondent
                        had validly rescinded the Investment Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     the return of the balance of the Investment
                        Funds (amounting to US$1,028,695);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     damages to be assessed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     further or alternatively, damages for fraudulent
                        misrepresentation or misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act
                        (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Misrepresentation
                        Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Judge allowed the Respondent’s
                    appeal from the Assistant Registrar’s decision to stay the action on the
                    ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Judge’s reasons for holding that
                    Singapore was not <em>forum non conveniens</em> were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     The only legally significant
                        geographical connections that the dispute had with Indonesia were:
                        (i) the location of the concessions in Indonesia; and (ii) the
                        Indonesian residency of the Second Appellant, who, in the Judge’s
                        opinion, was the “directing mind behind the corporate structures and
                        documentation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellants did not raise a compelling argument that
                        the Investment Agreement was governed by Indonesian law. Rather, reasonable
                        persons in the position of the parties would not have concluded that
                        Indonesian law should govern the Investment Agreement, given that:
                        (i) the Exclusive Mining Agreement was governed by UAE law; and
                        (ii) the Singapore JVA was governed by Singapore
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Appellants’ arguments on the law governing the alternative tort claims
                        did not present “insurmountable obstacles”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Appellants were not able to show
                        that the evidence of two Indonesian witnesses who allegedly witnessed the
                        extent of the Respondent’s drilling operations would be material. The
                        Appellants also failed to show whether these witnesses would be available or
                        whether other witnesses would be able to provide the same
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     On the
                        whole, the Appellants had failed to demonstrate the presence of another more
                        appropriate forum for the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The sole issue on appeal was whether the
                    Respondent’s action should be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In particular, we were concerned with
                    whether or not Indonesia was a clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum than
                    Singapore for the hearing of the dispute between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The approach in <em>Spiliada</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The general principles to be applied in the
                    context of the present appeal are well-established and may be traced back to the
                    seminal House of Lords decision of <em>Spiliada Maritime
                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460
                        (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). Indeed, the
                    principles set out in <em>Spiliada</em> have been approved
                    and applied a great many times by the Singapore courts. The applicable
                    principles were recently summarised in the decision of this court in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>CIMB
                    Bank</em>”), as follows (at [25]–[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The <em>locus classicus</em>
                            on the question of when a stay would be granted on the basis of
                                <em>forum non conveniens</em> is <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em>
                            [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”), a decision of the House of Lords where
                            Lord Goff of Chieveley, in delivering the leading judgment, laid
                            down certain guiding principles (at 476-478) for determining the
                            question of <em>forum non conveniens</em>
                            (“the <em>Spiliada</em> test”). Those
                            principles have been adopted by this court in several cases such as
                                <em>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast
                                Services Indonesia</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 345,
                                <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</em> [1995]
                            2 SLR(R) 851, <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu
                                Enterprises</em> (<em>Holdings</em>)
                                <em>Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 104 and
                                <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron von
                                Uexkull</em> [2007]
                                1 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Rickshaw
                                Investments</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The gist of these principles is that, under the
                            doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, a stay
                            will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some
                            other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action.
                            The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant and it is not
                            enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate
                            forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available
                            forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore.
                            The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and
                            substantial connection. In this regard, the factors which the court will
                            take into consideration include not only factors affecting convenience
                            or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but also other
                            factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where
                            the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court
                            concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (“stage one of the
                                <em>Spiliada</em> test”), that there is
                            no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial
                            of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it
                            concludes that there is some other available forum which <em>prima facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the
                            trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are
                            circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should
                            nevertheless be refused. In this connection, the court will consider all
                            the circumstances of the case. For this second stage inquiry
                            (“stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                            test”), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the
                            existence of those special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We will, in fact, proceed to analyse the facts
                    of the present appeal in accordance with the two stages enunciated in <em>Spiliada</em> and, consistent with the terminology adopted in
                        <em>CIMB Bank</em>, will refer to each stage as
                    “stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test” and
                    “stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test”,
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is worth noting that a decision on whether
                    to grant a stay of proceedings is, ultimately, a discretionary one. The
                    discretionary nature of the determination necessarily limits the role of an
                    appellate court; as this court has observed in <em>CIMB
                        Bank</em> (at [84]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of
                        proceedings, the judge will be exercising a discretion. Such an exercise of
                        discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court unless the
                        judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or he had taken into
                        account matters which he ought not to have taken into account or had failed
                        to take into account matters which he ought to have taken into account, or
                        his decision is plainly wrong (see <em>The Abidin
                            Daver</em> [1984] AC 398 at 420 <em>per</em> Lord Brandon of Oakbrook).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factors to consider under stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The courts will generally consider the
                    relevant connecting factors at <em>stage one</em> of the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> test. Although the list of factors is
                    obviously not closed and much will depend upon the precise factual matrix
                    concerned, Prof Yeo Tiong Min has furnished some helpful guidance, as
                    follows (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore –
                        Conflict of Laws</em> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009)
                        (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                    Singapore</em>”) at para 75.090):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">General connecting factors are considered at this stage. These include the
                        locations of the parties, relevant witnesses, facts, and evidence, and the
                        applicable law to the issues in dispute. As the search is for the forum that
                        is prima facie clearly more appropriate to try the case, it is important to
                        see what the case is about, and connections which have no or little bearing
                        on adjudication of the issues in dispute between the parties will carry
                        little weight. While there is a natural emphasis on the minimisation of
                        expense and inconvenience of trial at this stage, it should be borne in mind
                        that the true test is appropriateness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At this stage, differences in legal systems are generally ignored. In
                        general, five types of connections may conveniently be identified, but they
                        are not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The learned author then proceeds to list the
                    following “five types of connections” which he states (and as also
                    observed in the preceding paragraph) “are not exhaustive” (and see
                    generally the very helpful and perceptive account of these factors in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
                    paras 75.091–75.095):</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In so far as <em>stage
                        two</em> of the <em>Spiliada</em> test is
                    concerned, Prof Yeo observes as follows (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at para 75.096):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Stage Two, the court is primarily concerned with the question whether
                        there are circumstances by reason of justice why it should exercise its
                        jurisdiction even if it is not the prima facie natural forum. The ultimate
                        question of where the case should be heard for the interests of the parties
                        and the ends of justice must not be lost sight of. This part of the test
                        requires all circumstances to be taken into consideration, including factors
                        already taken into consideration in Stage One. The main consideration in
                        Stage Two is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreign
                            <em>prima facie</em> natural forum. The court of
                        the forum needs to tread a fine balance between justice to the parties and
                        international comity. In considering this question, the court will not pass
                        judgment on the competence or independence of the judiciary of another
                        country, all the more so of a friendly foreign country,<sup></sup>and will assiduously avoid comparing the quality of justice
                        obtainable under its own legal system and the foreign legal system. It is
                        not true that the quality of foreign judiciary will never be questioned, but
                        the court of the forum will take a very cautious approach. The mere fact
                        that the plaintiff has a legitimate or juridical advantage in proceedings in
                        Singapore will not be decisive. The plaintiff must establish with cogent
                        evidence that he will be denied substantial justice if the case is not heard
                        in the forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The learned author then proceeds to consider a
                    number of related issues under the following headings (and see generally (again)

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Australian approach not followed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Before proceeding to apply the principles just
                    stated, it might be appropriate to emphasise, once again, that the approach
                    adopted in the Singapore context may be <em>contrasted
                        with</em> that adopted in the <em>Australian</em>
                    context (consisting in what has been termed the “clearly inappropriate
                    forum test”, which is elaborated upon below). In so far as the present
                    Australian approach is concerned, it may, in fact, be traced back to the seminal
                    High Court of Australia decisions of <em>Oceanic Sun Line Special
                        Shipping Co v Fay</em> (1988) 165 CLR 197 (“<em>Oceanic Sun</em>”) and <em>Voth v
                        Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited</em> (1990)
                    171 CLR 538 (“<em>Voth</em>”).
                    However, it should be noted that the Singapore courts <em>rejected</em> the Australian approach (in favour of the approach in
                        <em>Spiliada</em>) fairly early on. In the Singapore
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak
                        Hern</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 851, for example,
                    L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the court, observed thus
                    (at [24]–[25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Counsel for the appellant sought to set out the
                            basis for the <em>Spiliada</em> test and submitted
                            that it was formulated at the time to prevent “forum
                            shopping” when the parties had little or no connection with the
                            forum in which the case was brought. On the strength of the Australian
                            authorities counsel submitted that the test in <em>Oceanic Sun</em> and approved in <em>Voth</em> should apply and urged this court to depart from
                            the principles enunciated in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v
                                Cansulex Ltd</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    On authority and on principle we cannot agree.
                                <em>The Spiliada</em> has been considered and
                            approved in <em>Brinkerhoff</em> and we can see no
                            reason for departing from that authority. The underlying basis in this
                            test is whether the local court is clearly an appropriate forum or not
                            and whether there is another forum which is distinctly and clearly more
                            appropriate. It has a more liberal approach which cut down local
                            parochialism as regards judicial adjudication and attaches greater
                            importance to consideration of international comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is notable that, whilst it was decided
                    first, <em>Oceanic Sun</em> was only a bare majority
                    decision of 3 to 2 in so far as the general approach to be adopted was
                    concerned (unlike the majority, both Wilson and Toohey JJ preferred the
                    test in <em>Spiliada</em> and (not surprisingly) arrived at
                    a different decision on the facts). However, the judgments of the majority also
                    raised a number of uncertainties inasmuch as it could not be said that there was
                    a clear majority (amongst the majority judges in <em>Oceanic
                        Sun</em>) in favour of what is presently known as the “clearly
                    inappropriate forum test” in the Australian context. Indeed, this
                    last-mentioned test was clearly set out in the judgment by Deane J (at
                    247–248). However, only Gaudron J (albeit not Brennan J) agreed
                    with Deane J in this particular regard (at 266).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The “clearly inappropriate forum
                    test” was, however, clearly endorsed in <em>Voth</em> (with only one judge (Toohey J (who was also in the
                    minority in <em>Oceanic Sun</em>)) being in the minority,
                    the learned judge stating (at 590) that he was “impenitent in adhering to
                    the view which Wilson J. and [he] expressed in <em>Oceanic
                        Sun</em>”). Significantly, Brennan J, who adopted a
                    narrower approach than “the clearly inappropriate forum test” in
                        <em>Oceanic Sun</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>), endorsed this particular test in <em>Voth</em>; as the learned judge put it (at 572):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I think it is more important that a test be authoritatively settled
                        than that I adhere to the test I prefer, and as any such test is judge-made
                        law, I add my acceptance of the test proposed by the majority. It is
                        unnecessary to consider whether the performance of the institutional duty of
                        enunciating the law authoritatively should prevail when Justices’
                        individual views diverge on questions of the true construction of the
                        Constitution or perhaps on questions of the true construction of a statute,
                        for that is not the present case. I therefore join in the decision that the
                        “clearly inappropriate” test be adopted for the determination
                        of applications of the three classes mentioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, although Brennan J agreed with the majority of the court
                    in <em>Voth</em> as to the particular test to be applied,
                    he did “respectfully dissent from the result of its application”
                        (<em>id</em>). In contrast, Toohey J, who (as we
                    have just seen) adopted the approach in <em>Spiliada</em>
                    instead, nevertheless arrived at the <em>same</em>
                    conclusion as the majority (who applied “the clearly inappropriate forum
                    test” instead) – thus illustrating the following observation made
                    by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment in
                    the same decision (at 558) (see also below at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The “clearly inappropriate forum” test is similar to and,
                        for that reason, is likely to yield the same result as the “more
                        appropriate forum” test in the majority of cases. The difference
                        between the two tests will be of critical significance only in those cases
                        – probably rare – in which it is held that an available foreign
                        tribunal is the natural or more appropriate forum but in which it cannot be
                        said that the local tribunal is a clearly inappropriate one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may, in this regard, also be made to the following
                    observations by Prof Yeo (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> at para 75.083):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A notable variation is found in Australian jurisprudence, where the courts
                        have struck a different balance. The Australian court will refuse to
                        exercise its jurisdiction only if it is demonstrated that it is a clearly
                        inappropriate forum. In many cases, the result will be the same as the
                        approach in <em>The Spiliada</em>, but there may be a
                        marginal case where it may be demonstrated that there is a clearly more
                        appropriate forum available elsewhere yet the forum is not a clearly
                        inappropriate forum, in which case stay of proceedings would <em>prima facie</em> be granted under the <em>Spiliada</em> approach but denied under the Australian approach.
                        The Singapore courts apply the <em>Spiliada</em>
                        approach because it is thought to be more consistent with international
                        comity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     
          <em>Voth</em> therefore
                    marks the clear establishment of the “clearly inappropriate forum
                    test” (see also Martin Davies, Andrew Bell and Paul Le Gay Bereton,
                        <em>Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 8th ed, 2010) (“<em>Nygh’s
                        Conflict of Laws in Australia</em>”) at
                    paras 8.13-8.24).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     And, in the decision of this court in

                    thus (at [32]–[35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    In so far as those
                            of the disputed foreign properties situated in Australia (“the
                            Australian properties”) are concerned, the appellant also
                            previously brought claims in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
                            Gzell J, in <em>Murakami v Wiryadi</em>
                            [2006] NSWSC 1354 (“<em>Murakami</em>”), stayed those proceedings on the
                            ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. The
                            learned judge applied the Australian approach to <em>forum non conveniens</em> as set out in the Australian High
                            Court decisions of <em>Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping
                                Co Inc v Fay</em> (1988) 165 CLR 197

                            189 CLR 345 to the effect that the court may stay or dismiss
                            proceedings if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the
                            availability of the foreign tribunal, the forum is clearly inappropriate
                            for the determination of the dispute (reference may similarly be made to
                            the (also) Australian High Court decision of <em>Regie
                                Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang</em> (2002)

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    Although
                            the test applied in the Australian context to the issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is quite different from
                            that set out in <em>Spiliada</em> ([26] supra),
                            there would (on most occasions) be no difference in the actual result
                            arrived at by the court (see, for example, <em>Oceanic
                                Sun Line</em> at 251-252 (<em>per</em>
                            Deane J) and 265-266 (<em>per</em>

                            Inappropriate’ Test?” (1999) 23 Melb Univ L Rev 30)). That having been
                            said, it is important to guard against simply equating the two tests
                            because (if nothing else) their respective points of emphasis are quite
                            different (see, for example, <em>Voth</em> at 558 <em>per</em> Mason CJ and Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; the
                            learned judges, however, also observed that, in applying the test under
                            Australian law, “the discussion by Lord Goff in <em>Spiliada</em> of relevant ‘connecting factors’ and ‘a
                            legitimate personal or juridical advantage’ provide[d] valuable
                            assistance” (<em>id</em> at 564-565) - observations which
                            were also cited and applied by Gzell J in <em>Murakami</em>
                            at ([39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    While we have
                            previously rejected the Australian approach to <em>forum
                                non conveniens</em> in favour of the test in <em>Spiliada</em>, which calls for a determination of
                            whether there is another forum which is clearly or distinctly more
                            appropriate than Singapore (see, for example, the decision of this court
                            in <em>Eng Liat Kiang</em> at [26]), Gzell J's
                            observations in <em>Murakami</em> ([32] supra) are
                            nevertheless helpful. This is because the factors which the learned
                            judge considered would apply with equal force in the context of the
                            doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> as set
                            out in <em>Spiliada</em>. In particular,
                            Gzell J noted that (see <em>Murakami</em> at
                            [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The connecting factors ... do not favour New South Wales against
                            Indonesia. [The appellant] is not resident in New South Wales and [the
                            first respondent] and [the fourth respondent] do not live in Australia.
                            The events [which are] the subject of complaint are just as much centred
                            in Indonesia where the non-disclosure of the New South Wales assets is
                            alleged to have occurred as in New South Wales where the assets were
                            acquired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The learned judge also noted (<em>id</em> at [46]), just as we have (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), that the <em>lex
                            causae</em> was Indonesian law. He further commented (at [47] of
                            <em>Murakami</em>) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If matters are to be determined in the New South Wales court expert
                            evidence will be required. If the issues are to be determined in the
                            Indonesian courts there is no need for experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, Gzell J was of the view (<em>id</em> at
                        [52]) that “it [was] in the interests of the parties that a proper
                        resolution of the issues be made in proceedings to be commenced in
                        Indonesia”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The factors and the arguments considered by
                            Gzell J in the preceding paragraph, although analysed in the
                            context of the Australian approach to <em>forum non
                                conveniens</em>, apply equally in the context of the approach
                            of this court as embodied in <em>Spiliada</em>
                            ([26] <em>supra</em>). Indeed, there is a
                            considerable overlap between the factors and the arguments considered by
                            Gzell J in <em>Murakami</em> and those
                            discussed above in the context of the present proceedings. There is, in
                            fact, good reason to believe that this is one instance where there would
                            be no difference in result regardless of whether the Australian approach
                            or the approach in <em>Spiliada</em> is adopted
                            (see also above at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It should be noted that the decision of
                    Gzell J in <em>Murakami v Wiryadi</em>
                    [2006] NSWSC 1354 was in fact reversed on appeal in the decision of
                    the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <em>Murakami v
                        Wiryadi &amp; Ors</em> [2010] NSWCA 7. However, the
                    general principles as well as observations set out in the quotation in the
                    preceding paragraph continue to represent the Australian approach towards the
                    issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, notwithstanding the
                    following observations by Kirby J in the High Court of Australia decision
                    of <em>Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang</em>
                    (2002) 210 CLR 491 (“<em>Zhang</em>”) (at 525):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like the Pilgrim I have not lost faith. One day <em>Voth</em> may be overruled and a principle of the common law may
                        be established more appropriate to contemporary circumstances of global and
                        regional disputes in which Australian courts, like those of every country,
                        must now operate. But until overruled by this Court or replaced by valid
                        legislation, <em>Voth</em> must be applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Indeed, a challenge mounted recently against
                    the present Australian approach in the subsequent (also) High Court of Australia
                    decision of <em>Puttick v Tenon</em> (2008)
                    238 CLR 265 was rejected, in no uncertain, terms by the majority. The
                    challenge (which was mounted by the Respondent) was, in fact, framed by way of
                    an invitation to the court to either overrule the “clearly inappropriate
                    forum test” in <em>Voth or</em> to <em>restate</em> the test in <em>Voth</em>
                    in a <em>modified</em> form by also permitting a stay when
                    there was a more appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute. The latter
                    was, in effect, an invitation to introduce the <em>Spiliada</em> test <em>in addition to</em> the
                    “clearly inappropriate forum test”. Not surprisingly, perhaps,
                    French CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Kiefel JJ <em>rejected</em> this invitation and reaffirmed the “clearly
                    inappropriate forum test” in <em>Voth</em>. Heydon
                    and Crennan JJ, however, whilst clearly of the view that <em>Voth</em> could not be overruled in that particular case, did
                    (perhaps somewhat curiously) add thus (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Voth’s</em> case should simply be followed
                        until the time comes, if it ever comes, for full argument to be developed
                        about its correctness, and for an argument that it is wrong to be
                        accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judges proceeded to give reasons as to why the test in
                        <em>Voth</em> could not be challenged in that
                    particular case. These included, first, that there was no “satisfactory
                    forensic background against which to explore the correctness of <em>Voth’s</em> case” (at [39]); that it was not
                    satisfactorily explained in detail how the considerations relevant to overruling
                    prior authorities (here, <em>Voth</em>) had been satisfied
                    (at [40]); that the written submissions advanced by the Respondent in relation
                    to the correctness of <em>Voth</em> “were not
                    developed in the detail which is desirable when a question of this important
                    kind is presented” (at [41]); that “it was not demonstrated that
                    even if the <em>Voth</em> test were overruled or modified,
                    there would be any difference in the result of the appeal”; and that
                    “[i]n the absence of that demonstration, any observations making a change
                    to the <em>Voth</em> test would in one sense be dicta
                    only”, which was “not in general a satisfactory method of
                    developing the law” (at [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The observations of both Heydon and
                    Crennan JJ are, on one reading at least, ambiguous although it might, on
                    another reading, be open to the interpretation that they were at least open to
                    the “clearly inappropriate forum test” in <em>Voth</em> being revisted on an appropriate occasion in the
                    foreseeable future. Looked at in this light, the following observations by the
                    authors of a leading Australian textbook may appear a little too strong (see
                        <em>Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia</em> at
                    para 8.24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary
                            Limited</em> (1990) 171 CLR 538] has been part of
                        Australian law for twenty years. In [<em>Puttick v Tenon
                            Ltd</em> (2008) 250 ALR 482], a new generation of High Court
                        justices, none of whom participated in <em>Voth</em>,
                        showed no inclination to reconsider the ‘clearly inappropriate
                        forum’ test. Despite all the academic lamentation and complaint,
                        judicial reform of the <em>Voth</em> test appears to be
                        past praying for. Without legislative change, the test is entrenched in
                        Australian law and critics must just grin and bear it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A final point – relativity of natural forum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     A final point might be noted. Counsel for the
                    Appellant, Mr Cavinder Bull, laid great emphasis upon the fact that there
                    were, in effect, no substantive connecting factors in relation to <em>Singapore</em>. He argued that this was a relevant factor as
                    stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test was <em>comparative</em> in nature. There is some force in this
                    argument inasmuch as the defendant must, under the first limb of the test in the
                        <em>Spiliada</em>, establish that there is <em>another</em> available forum which is clearly or distinctly
                    more appropriate than Singapore. To <em>that</em> end, the
                    number as well as quality of connecting factors in the <em>Singapore</em> context <em>is</em> relevant from
                    a comparative (or relational) perspective. And, to the extent that there are
                        <em>no</em> substantive connecting factors in relation
                    to Singapore, that must surely weigh in favour of the defendant. However, as
                    this court pointed out in <em>CIMB Bank</em> (at [26]; also
                    reproduced above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>), “it is not
                    enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate
                    forum” – which would, of course, be the situation if there were, in
                    the case concerned, <em>no</em> substantive connecting
                    factors in relation to <em>Singapore</em>. The defendant
                    must, as we have already noted, go <em>further</em> and
                    establish that there is <em>another</em> available forum
                    which is <em>clearly or distinctly more appropriate than
                        Singapore</em> (see also the decision of this court in <em>Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR
                    1007 at [4] (“<em>Siemens AG</em>”)). Hence,
                    notwithstanding the fact that there might be few – or even <em>no</em> – substantive connecting factors in relation to
                        <em>Singapore</em>, this does <em>not
                        necessarily</em> mean that the defendant would have discharged the
                    burden that is placed upon it under the first limb of the test in the <em>Spiliada</em>. This is, in fact, an excellent example of the
                    more <em>general</em> principle that <em>every</em> perspective in a given legal test <em>must</em> be considered. Indeed, in so far as this particular issue
                    is concerned, the following summary by Prof Yeo is particularly helpful
                    (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> (at
                    para 75.089), appropriately entitled “Relativity of Natural
                    Forum”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle of the natural forum does not seek to identify <em>the</em> most clearly appropriate forum in the absolute
                        sense. The search is for <em>a</em> natural forum, not
                            <em>the</em> natural forum. Four implications
                        follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Firstly, there may be cases where no forum can be said to be comparatively
                        more appropriate than any other. In such a case, stay will not be granted
                        because it cannot be shown that there is another forum that is clearly more
                        appropriate. Similarly, in a service out of jurisdiction case, it cannot be
                        rebutted that Singapore is the proper forum to hear the case. The Singapore
                        court will exercise its jurisdiction in such cases, even if it means
                        multiplicity of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, although the formulation in <em>The
                            Spiliada</em> is that the defendant seeking a stay of proceedings
                        must not only show that Singapore is not an appropriate forum, but that
                        there is clearly another more appropriate forum elsewhere, it should be
                        borne in mind that the inappropriateness of Singapore as a forum is relative
                        to the existence of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere. It is not
                        necessary to show that Singapore is a clearly inappropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, the defendant may show that two (or more) fora are clearly more
                        appropriate than Singapore, without having to identify one of them
                        specifically as <em>the</em> most appropriate
                        forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in
                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this
                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the
                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by
                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more
                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore
                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than
                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly
                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor
                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not
                        affect the proposition that the court should <em>prima
                            facie</em> stay the proceedings when the defendant has
                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum
                        elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We should note – parenthetically –
                    that, in <em>contrast</em> to the <em>Singapore</em> position, the <em>Australian</em>
                    position (see above at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>–<a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>) tends, by its very nature, to be focused,
                    instead, on (as Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ put it in
                        <em>Voth</em> (at 565)) “the inappropriateness
                    of the local court and not the appropriateness or comparative appropriateness of
                    the suggested foreign forum”. And, in the same decision, the learned
                    judges also observed, in a similar vein (at 558), that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the question which the [“clearly inappropriate forum”]
                        test presents is slightly different [from the approach in <em>Spiliada</em>] in that it focuses on the advantages and
                        disadvantages arising from a continuation of the proceedings in the selected
                        forum rather than on the need to make a comparative judgment between the two
                        forums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ
                    observed in <em>Zhang</em> (at 503) that “it should
                    at once be noted that a court is not an inappropriate forum merely because
                    another is more appropriate”. However, we would think that, on a
                    practical level at least, some comparative analysis is probably inevitable in
                    most cases. Indeed, in <em>Voth</em>, Mason CJ, Deane,
                    Dawson and Gaudron JJ observed (at 558) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The focus on the inappropriateness of the local forum] is not to deny
                        that considerations relating to the suitability of the alternative forum are
                        relevant to the examination of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of
                        the selected forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(See also <em>Voth</em> at 564-565 and <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Let us turn now to apply both the first limb
                    as well as the second limb of the test in the <em>Spiliada</em> to the facts of the present appeal. Before proceeding
                    to do so, it would be appropriate to review – in summary form – the
                    main arguments proffered on behalf of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Appellants argued that, as between
                    Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia was the more appropriate forum for hearing
                    the dispute between the parties. The Appellants emphasised that the following
                    connecting factors pointed towards Indonesia as the natural forum:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     Events relevant to the dispute
                        occurred in Indonesia. For example, Indonesia was the place where Cyriac
                        first met the Second and Third Appellants. Indonesia is also the location of
                        the mining concessions that are the subject of the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        parties have connections with Indonesia. The First Appellant is a UAE
                        company but it has a registered office in Indonesia. Both the Second and
                        Third Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent carries out
                        projects in Indonesia and its representative, Cyriac, spends a significant
                        amount of time there.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellants will have to rely on non-party witnesses who are
                        resident in Indonesia (“the Indonesian Witnesses”). Some of
                        these witnesses may have to be compelled to testify. In this regard, the
                        Judge erred in predetermining the witnesses that the Appellants wished to
                        call for the trial on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_d"></a>(d)     Documentary evidence relevant to the dispute is presently
                        located in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_e"></a>(e)     In so far, at least, as the Respondent’s alternative claim for
                        misrepresentation in tort is concerned, the natural forum is Indonesia
                        because that is the place where the tort occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Respondent’s claims are
                        governed by Indonesian law. The claim for misrepresentation is governed by
                        Indonesian law because Indonesian law is the <em>lex loci
                            delicti</em>. Indonesian law is also the law governing the
                        Investment Agreement because that is the law which has the closest and most
                        real connection with the Investment Agreement. In relation to the governing
                        law of the Investment Agreement, the Judge erred in suggesting that UAE law
                        might govern the Investment Agreement even though neither party raised the
                        applicability of UAE law in the hearing below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Appellants sought leave to raise a new
                        argument on the Respondent’s claim under the Misrepresentation Act.
                        The Appellants argued that the Respondent has no claim under the
                        Misrepresentation Act because the Misrepresentation Act does not have
                        extraterritorial effect, <em>ie</em>, that this Act
                        does not apply to misrepresentations occurring outside the territory of
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     On the whole, the Appellants submitted that,
                    as between Singapore and Indonesia, Indonesia is the more appropriate forum for
                    hearing the dispute. The Appellants further argued that, even if the Investment
                    Agreement was governed by UAE law, the connecting factors were still
                    overwhelmingly in favour of Indonesia. In any case, the Appellants urged us to
                    only consider whether Singapore was a more appropriate forum than Indonesia
                    since neither party was contending that the dispute should be heard in any forum
                    apart from Singapore or Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Respondent submitted that the following
                    connecting factors pointed towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum for
                    hearing the dispute:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellants chose to receive the
                        Investment Funds in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both the Second and Third Appellants have connections
                        with Singapore. The Second Appellant studied in Singapore. He also has a
                        Singapore bank account and he previously owned an apartment in Singapore.
                        The Second Appellant also previously held shares and directorships in
                        Singapore companies. The Third Appellant also holds shares and directorships
                        in Singapore companies. The Respondent also has connections with Singapore
                        in the form of a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     As for
                        the location of witnesses, the dispute is in relation to the discussions
                        between the Appellants and the Respondent. Therefore, the party witnesses
                            (<em>ie</em>, the Second and Third Appellants and
                        the Respondent’s representatives) are the most relevant witnesses. In
                        any case, the Appellants have not shown that adducing evidence via
                        video-link would be unsuitable. Furthermore, the travel time between
                        Indonesia and Singapore is not long and so the inconvenience occasioned by
                        having the case heard in Singapore is not significant. As for the need to
                        compel the witnesses, the Appellants have not adduced evidence on whether
                        the witnesses are compellable in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     The location of documents should not be given
                        any weight. The expense of transporting the documents to Singapore may be
                        compensated with an appropriate costs order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_e"></a>(e)     Indonesian law is not the governing law of the
                        Investment Agreement. Rather, the Investment Agreement is governed by
                        Singapore law because the Singapore JVA was abandoned only because of the
                        more advantageous tax benefits of using a UAE entity. The parties always
                        intended for Singapore law to govern the Investment Agreement.
                        Alternatively, the governing law is UAE law. As for the misrepresentation
                        claim, the Judge did not err in considering that the application of
                        Indonesian law was not an insurmountable obstacle. The Judge was merely
                        ascribing the weight that he was giving to the governing law as a connecting
                        factor. In any event, the Indonesian law issues for the tort claim are not
                        complex.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        place of the tort is indeed the <em>prima facie</em>
                        natural forum for the misrepresentation claim. However, this is just one of
                        the factors that the court should consider. Furthermore, this factor should
                        be given less weight because Indonesian tort law has not been shown to be
                        different from Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_g"></a>(g)     As for the Respondent’s claim under the
                        Misrepresentation Act, the Respondent took issue with the Appellants’
                        raising of a new point that was not canvassed before the Judge. On the
                        merits, the Respondent argued that the applicability of the
                        Misrepresentation Act has no bearing on the <em>forum non
                            conveniens</em> analysis because it is not a connecting
                        factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_h"></a>(h)     On
                        balance, the connecting factors do not point clearly and distinctly away
                        from Singapore to Indonesia. The connecting factors in favour of Indonesia
                        should be given little weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is perhaps important to state an obvious
                    point right at the outset. Notwithstanding the principles stated above, the
                        <em>facts</em> of each case are of equal importance.
                    Put simply, there is no mechanistic method that can be utilised in this –
                    indeed, any – legal context. To adopt such an approach would be a sure
                    recipe for legal disaster, producing (in the majority of cases at least) great
                    injustice. Hence, a close attention to the factual matrix of the present appeal
                    is imperative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s discretion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As we noted earlier (at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>), a decision to grant, or to refuse to grant,
                    a stay of proceedings is discretionary. We were of the view that the appeal
                    could not be allowed merely because we disagreed with the Judge’s exercise
                    of his discretion inasmuch as we might have arrived at a different conclusion on
                    the facts. To reiterate, the guiding principles in this regard were, as this
                    court stated in <em>CIMB Bank</em> (at [84] reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>), that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate
                        court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or
                        he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into
                        account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have
                        taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, the Appellants’ arguments suggested that the
                    Judge might have misapplied certain principles. For example, the Appellants
                    submitted that the Judge failed to correctly apply the <em>Albaforth</em> principle, which, as will be seen below (at <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>), is a principle that, in a dispute
                    involving a tort, the place where the tort occurred is <em>prima
                        facie</em> the natural forum. It was, therefore, necessary for us to
                    apply the <em>Spiliada</em> test afresh to the facts in
                    order to ascertain whether or not the Judge had misapplied the principles just
                    stated. We pause to observe – parenthetically – that the relevant
                    factors in the context of the facts of the present appeal fall (as we shall see)
                    principally within the purview of the first three categories of connections
                    identified by Prof Yeo (above at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The residence and place of business of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The First Appellant is a UAE corporation.
                    However, it has a representative office in Jakarta. The First Appellant appears
                    to have conducted most of its business from that office, as evidenced by the
                    following facts: (i) it sent the Letter of Offer to the Respondent from
                    Indonesia; (ii) it conducted its meeting of its board of directors to
                    increase its share capital at the representative office; and (iiii) it sent
                    the Respondent a copy of the Exclusive Mining Agreement from
                Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As for the other parties, the Second and Third
                    Appellants are resident in Indonesia. The Respondent is an Indian company with
                    operations in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The availability of non-party witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     We were of the view that the parties were
                    conflating two factors: (i) the <em>convenience</em>
                    in having the case decided in the forum where the witnesses are ordinarily
                    resident (“the Witness Convenience Factor”); and (ii) the
                        <em>compellability</em> of those witnesses (“the
                    Witness Compellability Factor”). We should analyse these factors
                    separately because each may suggest that different forums are the natural forum.
                    In addition, the Witness Compellability Factor could also be a relevant factor
                    under the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, as
                    was the argument of counsel in <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and
                        another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377
                    at [91]–[92] (“<em>Rickshaw
                    Investments</em>”). In this regard, we agreed with the following
                    observations of Prof Yeo (<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> at para 75.091):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The connections of relevant witnesses can be important too. The physical
                        locations of witnesses are generally of less significance today given the
                        ease of travel and the possible use of information and communication
                        technology. <em>A more important consideration is the
                            compellability of the witnesses</em>. This has been considered as
                        a Stage One factor although it involves a comparison of the procedures of
                        different legal systems. <em>Arguably, it sits more naturally
                            as a Stage Two factor</em> – a juridical advantage of trial
                        in a particular forum. However, <em>the benefit of
                            considering this as a Stage One factor is that compellability of the
                            defendant’s witnesses in the foreign court will be weighed in the
                            equation as well</em>, whereas as a Stage Two factor, the
                        defendant would have to prove that non-compellability in Singapore is a
                        denial of substantial justice, a very difficult case to make out. This
                        point, while illustrating the different objectives of the two stages, also
                        demonstrates the need to take a holistic view. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Given the differences between the two factors,
                    we considered them separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Witness Convenience Factor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In so far as the Witness Convenience Factor
                    was concerned, our view was that the Judge had, with respect, erred for two
                    reasons in holding that the Appellants had not shown that the evidence of the
                    Indonesian Witnesses is material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     First, as this court in <em>Good Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 has held (at [21]), the court hearing an
                    application for a stay should not predetermine the witnesses that the parties
                    should call. In fairness to the Judge, he did not hold that the evidence of the
                    Indonesian Witnesses was not necessary for the Appellants’ defence.
                    Rather, the Judge indicated that <em>the Appellants had failed to
                        demonstrate</em> that the evidence of the Indonesian Witnesses’
                    would be material. However, we were of the view that the Judge had, in
                    substance, predetermined that the Appellants did not need testimony from the
                    Indonesian Witnesses to advance their defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Second, the Appellants have endeavoured to
                    explain the reasons why they require the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses.
                    It would not be appropriate to require the Appellants to demonstrate <em>exactly</em> how they would use the testimony of the
                    Indonesian Witnesses at this interlocutory stage. The Appellants have not yet
                    prepared their Defence. We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant
                    applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation,
                    that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for
                    defendants to manufacture a connecting factor. Our view was that a defendant
                    should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably
                    relevant to its defence. The Appellants have, in our view, met that
                    threshold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Since the Appellants require the testimony of
                    the Indonesian Witnesses, it appears that this factor points to Indonesia as the
                    natural forum. However, our analysis did not end there. It was necessary for us
                    to consider whether (i) the possibility of obtaining evidence from the
                    Indonesian Witnesses through video-link and (ii) the fact that Indonesia is
                    relatively close to Singapore suggest that this factor should not be given
                    substantial weight. Our view was that both considerations were persuasive and
                    hence operated against the Appellants on this particular
                sub-issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     With regard to the first consideration, this
                    court has endorsed the views of the High Court in <em>Peters
                        Rogers May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 381 (at [26]) on how the possibility of obtaining video-link
                    evidence should impact the stage one analysis of the <em>Spiliada</em> test (see <em>Good Earth</em> at
                    [21]). The Appellants have not explained why the evidence of the Indonesian
                    Witnesses cannot be given via video-link.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As for the second consideration, we note that
                    this court in <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR(R) 1206 held (at [35]) that the availability of witnesses
                    should not be a significant factor if the witnesses are from Malaysia because of
                    the proximity of Singapore to Malaysia. This consideration applies with equal
                    force to Indonesia, which (as the Respondent has argued) is also relatively near
                    to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Witness Compellability Factor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In so far as the Witness Compellability Factor
                    is concerned, a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in a
                    Singapore court (see Order 38, rule 18(2) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)). Therefore, the fact that the
                    Indonesian Witnesses cannot be compelled by a Singapore court to either testify
                    in person in Singapore or to give evidence via video-link is a factor that
                    points to Indonesia as being the natural forum. The Appellants have argued that
                    the Indonesian Witnesses may need to be compelled to testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     A countervailing consideration is, as the
                    Respondent has argued, that the Appellants have not shown that the Indonesian
                    Witnesses would be compellable in an Indonesian court if this dispute were heard
                    in Indonesia. The Respondent cited the recent Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 111 (“<em>Sun Jin
                        Engineering</em>”) in support of the argument that the
                    Appellants should have led evidence on the compellability of the Indonesian
                    Witnesses in the Indonesian courts. In <em>Sun Jin
                        Engineering</em>, the court had the benefit of expert evidence on
                    whether foreign witnesses were compellable in the alternative forum (the
                    Maldives).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     With respect, the Respondent has misunderstood
                    this particular aspect of the decision in <em>Sun Jin
                        Engineering</em>. The Appellants have correctly explained that in
                        <em>Sun Jin Engineering</em>, the court considered that
                    the expert evidence on whether witnesses were compellable in the Maldives was
                    unclear. Notwithstanding this, the court considered that it was <em>more likely</em> that the Maldivian witnesses would testify
                    if the case were heard in the Maldives (see <em>Sun Jin
                        Engineering</em> at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We took a similar view in this appeal.
                    Although it would have been preferable to have had expert evidence on whether
                    the Indonesian Witnesses are compellable to testify in an Indonesian court, it
                    is more likely that the Indonesian Witnesses would testify if the dispute were
                    heard in an Indonesian court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The governing law of the claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As this court has observed (in <em>Rickshaw Investments</em> at [42]), the governing law of the
                    claims raised by the parties is a significant factor in stage one of the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Characterising the issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Before determining the governing law of the
                    claims, it is necessary for us to characterise the issues raised by the claims.
                    The first stage of any choice of law analysis is to characterise the issues that
                    the parties have raised (see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision
                    of <em>Macmillan Inc v Bishopsgate Investments plc
                        (No 3)</em> [1996] 1 WLR 387 at 407).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Respondent has made claims (see also above
                    at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>) for the following: (i) a
                    declaration that the contract was validly rescinded; (ii) restitution of
                    the remainder of the Investment Funds; (iii) damages for misrepresentation
                    in contract; (iv) damages for misrepresentation in tort; and
                    (v) damages for misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The first and the third claims are claims in
                    contract. The second claim is a claim in restitution. However, the choice of law
                    analysis for the restitutionary claim is the same as the choice of law analysis
                    for the contract claims because the restitutionary claim is consequential on the
                    failure of the Investment Agreement (see <em>CIMB Bank</em>
                    at [41]). The fourth claim is a claim in tort and the fifth claim is a statutory
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The governing law for the contractual and restitutionary
                claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(a)   The choice of law rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     It is well established that a three stage
                    approach is applied to determine the governing law of a contract (see, for
                    example, the decision of this court in <em>Pacific Recreation Pte

                    Recreation</em>”) at [36]). At the first stage, the court considers
                    if the contract expressly states its governing law (“the Express
                    Law”). If the contract is silent, the court proceeds to the second stage
                    and considers whether it can infer the governing law from the intentions of the
                    parties (“the Implied Law”). If the court is unable to infer the
                    parties’ intentions, it moves to the third stage and determines the law
                    which has the closest and most real connection with the contract (“the
                    Objective Law”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     It is clear that there was no Express Law. We
                    were of the view, however, that it is possible to determine the Implied Law. It
                    is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that UAE law govern the
                    Investment Agreement given the choice of that law in a closely related contract,
                        <em>viz</em>, the Exclusive Mining Agreement. The
                    Exclusive Mining Agreement was, in fact, sent to the Respondent. The Letter of
                    Offer also refers to the Exclusive Mining Agreement three times. Furthermore,
                    the Exclusive Mining Agreement was essential to the Investment Agreement.
                    Without it, the First Appellant would have had nothing of value to offer the
                    Respondent in exchange for its provision of expertise.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The editors of <em>Dicey and
                        Morris (11th Ed)</em> cite a number of cases for this
                    proposition, including the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Re United Railways of Havana</em> [1960] Ch 52
                        (“<em>Re United Railways of
                    Havana</em>”). <em>Re United Railways of
                        Havana</em> involved two related contracts that were part of a
                    transaction for an English railway company to obtain finance to purchase rolling
                    stock. The English railway company incorporated a subsidiary in Pennsylvania and
                    sold the rolling stock to that subsidiary. The subsidiary then leased the
                    rolling stock to the English railway company (“the First
                    Contract”). Under the terms of the First Contract, the English railway
                    company was to pay rentals to the subsidiary. The subsidiary entered into a
                    contemporaneous contract with a trust company (“the Second
                    Contract”). Under the terms of the Second Contract, the subsidiary
                    assigned its rights under the First Contract to the trust company. In effect,
                    this arrangement meant that the English railway company would pay the rentals to
                    the trust company which would in turn pay the rentals to holders of trust
                    certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     One of the issues in <em>Re United Railways of Havana</em> was the governing law of the
                    First Contract. Having held that the Second Contract was governed by <em>Pennsylvanian</em> law, the English Court of Appeal proceeded
                    to hold that the First Contract was also governed by Pennsylvanian law because
                    that was both the Implied Law and the Objective Law. The following portion of
                    the court’s judgment is instructive (<em>Re United
                        Railways of Havana</em> at 94):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been material to consider the agreement in this connection because
                        it was held by the judge, and argued before us by counsel for the
                        respondents, that <em>the proper law of the agreement and of
                            the lease was intended to be the same</em>. <em>This is probably, though not, we think, inevitably, true</em>. In
                        the words of the judge: "The lease is expressly recited in the agreement,
                        and in the lease there is a recital of the intention immediately to assign
                        the benefit of the lease to the trustee. <em>The two
                            documents are essential parts of the same transaction</em>,
                        namely, the Philadelphia Plan. In those circumstances one would expect that
                        they would each have the same proper law, and I hold that they have." One
                        certainly cannot ignore the fact that <em>each of the two
                            documents constituted essential parts of one entire transaction and it
                            would, we think, be unusual if the parties concerned in that transaction
                            should desire one part to be governed by the law of Cuba (which is in
                            many relevant respects totally different from American law) and the
                            other part to be governed by the law of Pennsylvania</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that <em>Re United Railways of
                        Havana</em> proceeded on appeal to the House of Lords (see <em>In re United Railways of Havana and Regla Warehouses Ltd</em>
                    [1961] AC 1007 (“<em>Re United Railways of
                        Havana (HL)</em>”)). On this particular point, the House of
                    Lords considered that the Objective Law was Pennsylvanian law (see <em>Re United Railways of Havana (HL)</em> at 1068
                        (<em>per</em> Lord Denning) and 1081 (<em>per</em> Lord Morris)). The judgment at the House of
                    Lords did not consider whether the Implied Law was Pennsylvanian law (and was,
                    incidentally, one of the rare decisions that was overruled (pursuant to the
                    House of Lords Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966]
                    1 WLR 1234) by the House of Lords in <em>Miliangos v
                        George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</em> [1976] AC 443 (albeit with
                    Lord Simon of Glaisdale dissenting (on the issue as to whether or not the
                    “breach date conversion” rule in <em>Re United
                        Railways of Havana (HL)</em> ought to be departed from and be
                    substituted with the rule that an English court was entitled to give judgment
                    for a sum of money expressed in a foreign currency in the case of obligations of
                    a money character to pay foreign currency under a contract, the proper law of
                    which was that of a foreign country and when the money of account was that of
                    that country or possibly some country other than the United
                Kingdom))).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     We also considered decisions such as the
                    English High Court decisions in <em>The Njegos</em> [1936]
                    1 P 90 (“<em>The Njegos</em>”) and
                        <em>The Adriatic</em> [1931] P 241 to be
                    relevant because they consider that it is possible to infer that the parties
                    concerned intended that a contract be governed by the same law as the governing
                    law of a related contract. In <em>The Njegos</em>, for
                    example, a bill of lading incorporated the terms of a charterparty. The
                    charterparty contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration in
                    England. The parties agreed that the proper law of the charterparty was English
                    law. The issue related to the governing law of the bills of lading. The court
                    found that the bills of lading did not incorporate the arbitration clause and
                    hence the governing law could not be inferred from the arbitration clause.
                    However, the court nevertheless held that English law governed the bills of
                    lading because the parties should be presumed to have intended that the bills of
                    lading be governed by the same law as the law governing the charterparty
                        (<em>The Njegos</em> at 107). It might also be noted
                    that the Singapore High Court in <em>Las Vegas Hilton Corp
                        (trading as Las Vegas Hilton) v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 589 referred (at [39]) to <em>The
                        Njegos</em> when discussing the circumstances in which an inference
                    may be drawn in relation to the governing law of a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Returning to the relevant facts of the present
                    appeal, we considered that it was possible to infer that the parties intended
                    that the Investment Agreement be governed by the same law that governs the
                    Exclusive Mining Agreement (UAE law) because of the close relation between the
                    contracts. We did not consider it to be material that the Exclusive Mining
                    Agreement and the Investment Agreement were not between the same parties. The
                    related contracts in the decisions referred to above (at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> and <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>)
                    were also between different parties. The crucial point is that the two contracts
                    in each of those decisions were so closely related that the parties could not
                    reasonably be considered as having intended that different laws govern the
                    related contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     This raises the issue as to whether the Judge
                    was entitled to suggest that the applicable law was UAE law when the parties
                    proceeded on the basis that the applicable law was either Singapore law or
                    Indonesian law. The Appellants argued that the Judge should not have suggested
                    that the applicable law was UAE law without inviting the parties to make
                    submissions on the potential applicability of UAE law. The Appellants relied on
                    the decision of this court in <em>Pacific Recreation</em>
                    as support for this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It is indeed true that the Judge should have
                    allowed the parties to submit on the potential applicability of UAE law.
                    However, it is open to us to reach a provisional view that the governing law of
                    the Investment Agreement is UAE law because both parties had the opportunity to
                    submit, in this appeal, on the potential applicability of UAE law – which
                    opportunity they in fact availed themselves of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The governing law for the alternative tort claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(a)   The choice of law rule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The choice of law rule that Singapore courts
                    apply for torts is the double actionability rule (see <em>Rickshaw Investments</em> at [53]). The double actionability rule
                    provides that the tort must be actionable under both the <em>lex
                        fori</em> and the <em>lex loci delicti</em>.
                    Exceptionally, the double actionability rule may be displaced such that the tort
                    may be actionable in Singapore even though it is not actionable under either the
                        <em>lex loci delicti</em> or the <em>lex
                        fori</em>. The exception may even be applied to provide that the law
                    of a third country is the applicable law for the tort (see <em>Rickshaw Investments</em> at [56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(b)   analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     We have to first determine the place of the
                    tort in order to ascertain the <em>lex loci delicti</em>.
                    This posed some difficulty in the present appeal because the elements
                    constituting the tort of misrepresentation did not occur in a single
                    jurisdiction. The alleged misrepresentations were made in Indonesia. But at
                    least some of the misrepresentations were received in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The test that is commonly applied for
                    determining the place of the tort is that which looks at the events constituting
                    the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose (“the
                    Substance Test”) (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Distillers Co. (Biochemicals) Ltd v Thompson</em>
                    [1971] AC 458 at 468 and the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Metal und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson
                        Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc &amp; Anor</em> [1990]
                    1 QB 391 at 443). The Singapore courts have also applied the Substance
                    Test (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decisions of <em>Wing Hak Man and another v Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and others</em>
                    [2009] 1 SLR(R) 446 at [26] and <em>Focus Energy Ltd v
                        Aye Aye Soe</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 1086 at
                [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The English courts have crystallised the
                    Substance Test into a more certain rule in cases of misrepresentations made in
                    one jurisdiction and received in another jurisdiction. In the context of
                    determining the place of tort for the purpose of leave to serve out of
                    jurisdiction, the English Court of Appeal has held that the place of the tort is
                    the place where the representation is “received and acted upon”
                    (see the English Court of Appeal decisions of <em>Cordoba
                        Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The
                        “Albaforth”)</em> [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 at
                    92 (“<em>The Albaforth</em>”) and <em>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal</em>
                    [1979] QB 333 at 345–346). A different approach, however, was
                    taken in a case where the misrepresentation occurred in one jurisdiction to an
                        <em>unspecified class</em> of persons and was received
                    and relied upon in a second jurisdiction. The court found that the tort occurred
                    in the first jurisdiction (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Cordova Land Co v Victor Bros Inc</em> [1966]
                    1 WLR 793 at 801). Prof Yeo, in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, concisely states the
                    approach taken in these misrepresentation cases thus (at
                    para 75.378):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The tort of misrepresentation is generally committed in the country where
                        the representation is <em>received and acted upon</em>,
                        at least where the representation is directed specifically at the plaintiff,
                            <em>unless the place is fortuitous in the
                            circumstances</em>, or if the receipt and reliance occur in
                        different countries. If the representation is made <em>at
                            large</em>, then the tort may have occurred in the <em>place where the representation is made</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It should be noted, in passing, that the
                    English courts <em>now</em> apply a <em>different</em> test for determining the place of the tort. For cases
                    arising before the date when the Rome II Regulation came into force
                    (11 January 2009), the test for the place of the tort is found in
                    s 11(2) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
                    1995 (c 42) (UK) (“the PILMPA”) (which is, of course, not
                    applicable in Singapore). That provision defines the place of the tort
                    differently for personal injury cases (see s 11(2)(a) of the PILMPA),
                    property damage cases (see s 11(2)(b) of the PILMPA) and all other cases
                    (see s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA). The present case would have come within the
                    scope of s 11(2)(c) of the PILMPA, under which the place of the tort would
                    be the place where “the most significant element or elements” of
                    the events constituting the tort in question occurred (see <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at
                    para 35-088–35-089 (“<em>Dicey, Morris and
                        Collins</em>”)). For cases coming within the purview of the
                    Rome II Regulation, there is no longer a need to consider the place of the tort
                    because other connecting factors, such as the place where the damage occurs and
                    the place of habitual residence, are utilised instead (see generally <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws</em>, Third
                    Cumulative Supplement to the Fourteenth Edition at
                    paras S35-194–S35-200).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     We were of the view that the approach adopted
                    by the English courts (as discussed above at <a href="#p1_91">[91]</a>) has some merit. The Substance Test is itself rather broad
                    and open-ended. There is, for example, room for debate as to whether the place
                    where the representation was made is more significant than the place where the
                    representation was received – and <em>vice
                    versa</em>. More importantly, both would, theoretically at least, satisfy
                    the Substance Test. It would therefore help to have more concrete rules, with
                    appropriate exceptions, for particular torts. For misrepresentations, it is
                    suggested that, if the representation was received and acted upon in a single
                    jurisdiction, that place should be the place of the tort unless that place was
                    fortuitous or if the receipt and reliance occur in different countries. The
                    Substance Test (in its more general form and possible
                    “incarnations”) may nevertheless still be resorted to in cases not
                    falling comfortably within this suggested (and more specific) rule. However, for
                    reasons which we will elaborate upon in a moment, there is no need to rule
                    definitively on this point in the present appeal. In particular, the
                    circumstances are such that the suggested rule cannot (as we shall see) be
                    applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As just mentioned, the present appeal is, in
                    fact, a case that does not fit comfortably within the suggested rule. The actual
                    misrepresentation was <em>received</em> in India because
                    that was the place where the First Appellant sent the Letter of Offer and the
                    Exclusive Mining Agreement. Both those documents contained a representation that
                    the First Appellant had mining concessions with one million tonnes of iron ore.
                    However, the Appellants contend that other representations were also made during
                    meetings in Indonesia as to the mining concessions that the First Appellant
                    could rely on to make up a total of one million tonnes of iron ore. The
                    representations were also <em>acted upon</em> in <em>two</em> jurisdictions. The Respondent acted on the
                    representation by remitting funds from India. The Respondent also acted on the
                    representation in Indonesia by conducting drilling works at the Pelaihari
                    Concession. Accordingly, it is not possible to apply the suggested rule.
                    Instead, we applied the general Substance Test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Applying the general Substance Test, we were
                    of the view that the place of the tort was Indonesia. Indonesia was the place
                    where most of the negotiations took place. The Respondent also took steps in
                    reliance of the representations in Indonesia. The only reason why the
                    representations in the Letter of Offer and the Exclusive Mining Agreement were
                    received in India was because the Respondent was based in India. Accordingly, we
                    were of the view that the <em>lex loci delicti</em> is
                    Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It remained for us to consider the
                    Respondent’s contention that Indonesian law has not been shown to be
                    different from Singapore law. In this regard, we noted that strict proof of the
                    differences between Indonesian and Singapore law was not necessary. As this
                    court observed in <em>Rickshaw Investments</em>, we may
                    take notice that the laws of other jurisdictions are likely to be different (at
                    [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Choice of law questions raise a related issue regarding a party's
                        evidential burden to plead foreign law. In <em>Goh Chok Tong
                            v Tang Liang Hong</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 811, Lai Kew
                        Chai J pointed pertinently to <em>the need for foreign
                            law to be pleaded</em>, and held that if foreign law was not in
                        fact pleaded, it would be presumed to be the same as the relevant position
                        under Singapore law (see generally at [77]-[84], and especially at [79]):
                        see also <em>Ertel Bieber and Company v Rio Tinto Company,
                            Limited</em> [1918] AC 260 at 294-295. Where this
                        evidentiary presumption can be invoked, the applicability of a foreign
                            <em>lex causae</em> under choice of law rules may
                        therefore be reduced in significance since the forum is unlikely to have
                        difficulty applying a foreign law which is (assumed to be) identical to the
                            <em>lex fori</em>. In this regard, however, a
                        number of cases suggest that a court may, despite a party's failure to
                        adduce proof of foreign law, have regard to the fact that the principles in
                        the foreign jurisdiction concerned will, in all likelihood, differ from the
                            <em>lex fori</em> in some respects (see, for
                        example, the Singapore High Court decision of <em>PT Jaya
                            Putra Kundur Indah v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd</em>
                        [1996] SGHC 285 at [44] ("<em>PT
                        Jaya</em>")). Hence, in the present case, the mere factum of a foreign
                            <em>lex causae</em>, <em>ie</em>, German law, may be accorded due weight <em>despite</em> the respondent's failure to adduce evidence
                        regarding the content of this law. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The statutory claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions
                    (see above at [58(g)]), whether the Misrepresentation Act potentially applies is
                    a relevant consideration under stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test because it is relevant for this court to consider
                    the law governing the claims raised by the Respondent. For example, if the scope
                    of the Misrepresentation Act is such that it potentially applies to the present
                    case, then that would be a factor against Indonesia being the natural forum
                    because greater expense and inconvenience would result in having the application
                    of a Singapore statute heard in an Indonesian court. This is <em>not</em> to state that we are determining the <em>substantive</em> issue as to whether the Respondent’s claim
                    under the Misrepresentation Act is sustainable on the facts, as we cannot,
                        <em>ex hypothesi</em>, make this determination in the
                    context of the present proceedings. Rather, we are determining whether the
                        <em>scope</em> of the Misrepresentation Act is such
                    that it <em>potentially</em> applies in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Before considering the scope of the
                    Misrepresentation Act, we should elucidate the approach that we took in our
                    analysis. The Appellants approached the issue of the scope of the
                    Misrepresentation Act from the perspective of the presumption against
                    extraterritoriality. It is useful to clarify that there are in fact two aspects
                    to this presumption in the conflict of laws context. Prof Yeo notes as
                    follows (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
                    para 75.292):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the conflictual scope of legislation is not spelt out, it has often
                        been said that there is a presumption that legislation of the forum is
                        intended only to have territorial effect. There are two overlapping aspects
                        to this presumption. <em>Firstly</em>, as a matter of
                            <em>private international law</em>, the presumption
                        is that the statutory provision <em>only applies if the
                            relevant connecting factor points to the law of the forum as the law
                            governing the issue</em>. <em>Secondly</em>,
                            <em>whatever the basis that the statute
                            applies</em> (whether as forum mandatory law, or as the
                        substantive law governing the issue by reason of the forum’s choice of
                        law rule, or as forum procedural law), it is presumably <em>only intended to affect activities occurring within the territory of
                            the forum</em>, or to <em>activities abroad of
                            nationals of the forum</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     
          <em>Dicey, Morris and
                        Collins</em> note that there are two approaches to determining the
                    scope of a statute in the conflict of laws context. However, the editors do not
                    consider the two approaches to be part of a common exercise of deriving
                    parliamentary intention. The following remarks by the editors, in the context of
                    a discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76) (UK),
                    are instructive (at para 1-040):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court, when confronted by a statute of its own law or of foreign law
                        which is expressed in general terms like this, could use one of the two
                        methods to determine its scope. The <em>first</em> is
                        to <em>interpret the statute in the light of its purpose and
                            background</em> so as to read into it the limitations which the
                        legislature would have expressed if it had given thought to the matter. This
                        is an artificial method, and perhaps a dangerous one, because <em>ex hypothesi</em> the legislature gave no thought to the
                        matter – if it had done so it would have expressed the limitations.
                        The <em>second method</em> is to <em>apply general principles derived from the conflict of laws</em>
                        – i.e. <em>first characterise the question</em>
                        as relating to capacity to marry [as noted above, this quotation is from a
                        discussion on the scope of s 2 of the Marriage Act 1949 (c 76)
                        (UK), which provides that “[a] marriage between persons either of
                        whom is under the age of sixteen shall be void”], and then apply the
                        relevant conflict rule to the question so characterised. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Our view was that, conceptually, it is
                    better to consider the two approaches as part of a common exercise of discerning
                    parliamentary intention. If Parliament clearly intended for a statute to apply
                    even where the choice of law rules suggest that Singapore law does not apply,
                    the courts must not disregard Parliamentary intention and refuse to apply the
                    statute. Parliament has the power to legislate extraterritorially (see the
                    decision of this court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Taw Cheng
                        Kong</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 489 at [37]). The choice of law
                    rules are simply useful tools in ascertaining Parliamentary intention on the
                    geographical scope of our laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    On the first aspect of the presumption, the
                    starting point is to characterise the issue that the Respondent has raised with
                    its claim that the Appellants have induced it to enter into a contract through a
                    misrepresentation. The competing characterisations are a tort and a contract
                    characterisation. It is not necessary to reach a firm conclusion on the proper
                    characterisation because, on either characterisation, the applicable law is not
                    Singapore law. As considered above, the applicable law on a contract
                    characterisation is UAE law (see above at <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a>) and the applicable law based on a tort characterisation is
                    Indonesian law (see above at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>).
                    Therefore, on the first aspect of the presumption, we may presume that
                    Parliament did not intend that the Misrepresentation Act apply to the present
                    case because Singapore law does not govern the issue that the Respondent has
                    raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The second aspect of the presumption does
                    not rely on choice of law rules. Parliament is <em>generally</em> presumed to have intended for its laws to only apply
                    to activity in Singapore (see the decision of this court in <em>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 377 at
                    [38]–[39] (“<em>Parno</em>”)). This
                    presumption may be displaced by clear indication of Parliamentary intention that
                    the statute concerned is intended to apply extraterritorially (see <em>Parno</em> at [39]). This intention need not be stated
                    expressly (see <em>Parno</em> at [38]). As an illustration,
                    the Singapore High Court recently held that the presumption against
                    extraterritoriality was rebutted in the Traditional Chinese Medicine
                    Practitioners Act (Cap 333A, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Traditional
                    Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act”) on the basis that extraterritorial
                    application of that statute would serve Parliamentary intention and would not
                    cause any difficulty with international comity and enforcement of the statute
                    (see <em>Huang Danmin v Traditional Chinese Medicine
                        Practitioners Board</em> [2010] SGHC 152 at
                        [36]-[38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Applying this general presumption, the
                    Misrepresentation Act is presumed to apply only to misrepresentations within
                    Singapore territory. Unlike, for example, s 37 of the Prevention of
                    Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“the Prevention of
                    Corruption Act”), the Misrepresentation Act is silent as to its
                    geographical scope. It is clear, therefore, that the Singapore Parliament has
                    not <em>expressly</em> stipulated that it intended that the
                    Misrepresentation Act apply extraterritorially. However, it seems that the
                    intention underlying the Misrepresentation Act would be furthered if the
                    Misrepresentation Act were applied to misrepresentations occurring outside
                    Singapore territory but <em>only if</em> the applicable law
                    of the relevant contract were Singapore law. The purpose of the
                    Misrepresentation Act, which is based on the Misrepresentation Act 1967
                    (c 7) (UK), is well known and is concisely stated by the editors of
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (30th Ed,
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) in the following manner (at
                    para 6-001):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Prior to the enactment of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the
                        position broadly speaking was that a misrepresentation which induced a
                        person to enter into a contract gave the representee the right to rescind
                        the contract, subject to certain conditions, but <em>generally gave him no right to damages unless the misrepresentation had
                            contractual force</em>. Since the coming into force of the
                        Misrepresentation Act the representee <em>will always be able
                            to claim damages for negligent misrepresentation</em> in
                        circumstances in which he could have recovered damages had the
                        misrepresentation been fraudulent. In addition the Act <em>gives the court a discretion to refuse to permit a representee to
                            rescind a contract, but to award him damages in lieu of
                            rescission</em>, if the misrepresentation is negligent or wholly
                        innocent; but it leaves the representee with an absolute right to rescind
                        where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. The Act of 1967 <em>does not, however, alter the rules as to what constitutes an
                            effective misrepresentation</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It appears, therefore, that the purposes
                    underlying the Misrepresentation Act are two-fold: (i) to supplement the
                    remedies available to a representee under common law (more accurately, under the
                    then common law as the seminal House of Lords decision in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners
                        Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465 had been decided by the time the
                    Misrepresentation Act had been enacted and had filled the then existing gap,
                    albeit in different manner than that provided for pursuant to s 2(1) of the
                    Misrepresentation Act (see, for example, <em>Cheshire, Fifoot and
                        Furmston’s Law of Contract – Second Singapore and Malaysian
                        Edition</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1998) (“<em>Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston</em>”) at
                    pp 468–471)); and (ii) to confer the courts with flexibility in
                    remedial matters by allowing courts to award damages in lieu of rescission,
                    which flexibility was not available under the common law (pursuant to
                    s 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act (see also <em>Cheshire,
                        Fifoot and Furmston</em> at pp 482–484)). These purposes
                    would not appear to be enhanced if the Misrepresentation Act were applicable to
                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory in relation to
                    contracts governed by foreign law. Unlike, for example, the Prevention of
                    Corruption Act or the Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Act, the
                    Misrepresentation Act is not intended to regulate conduct or protect classes of
                    persons. The purposes of such conduct regulating and protective statutes would,
                    perhaps, be advanced if they are applied without strict regard to territorial
                    links. A statute that merely supplements existing common law remedies with
                    respect to the <em>Singapore</em> common law of contract,
                    without serving a conduct regulating or protective function, on the other hand,
                    does not appear to require <em>general</em>
                    extraterritorial application to have its purposes advanced. If, however, the
                    relevant contract were governed by Singapore law (whether by express choice or
                    otherwise), it would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the
                    Misrepresentation Act to say that it applies even to misrepresentations
                    occurring outside Singapore territory. In fact, we would suggest that it would
                    be highly artificial if a choice of Singapore law in a contract only brings into
                    operation Singapore <em>common law</em> for
                    misrepresentations occurring outside Singapore territory without the
                    supplementary or facilitative provisions of the Misrepresentation
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As we have held, the Investment Agreement
                    might be governed by UAE law (see above at <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a>). It follows, therefore, that the Misrepresentation Act
                    does not apply because the misrepresentation occurred outside the territory of
                    Singapore and the Investment Agreement was not governed by Singapore law.
                    Therefore, the fact that the Respondent has raised a claim based on the
                    Misrepresentation Act should not be a relevant factor in stage one of the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other connecting factors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The place of the tort</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    As this court accepted in <em>Rickshaw</em> (at [39]), for tort claims, the place of the tort is
                        <em>prima facie</em> the natural forum. This principle
                    is derived from <em>The Albaforth</em> (at 96) and was
                    accepted by the House of Lords in <em>Berezovsky v
                        Michaels</em> [2000] 1 WLR 1004 (at 1014). However, as was
                    observed in <em>Rickshaw</em> (at [40]), <em>The Albaforth</em> principle is only a <em>prima
                        facie</em> position. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal recently noted,
                    the place of the tort may, in some cases, be fortuitous (see <em>The Peng Yan</em> [2009] 1 HKLRD 144 at [28], <em>per</em> Ma CJHC (with whom Cheung J agreed)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is therefore important when applying <em>The
                            Albaforth</em> principle in the context of <em>forum non conveniens</em> applications, to examine just how close
                        a connection there really exists with any given <em>forum</em>. In some cases, the place of the commission of the
                        tort may be decisive; in others, perhaps not weighty at all. The underlying
                        principle to be firmly borne in mind is the basic test in <em>The Spiliada</em> and <em>The Adhiguna
                            Meranti</em>. The place of the commission of the tort may in some
                        cases be quite fortuitous and may provide no more than a convenient starting
                        point or <em>prima facie</em> position. The court is
                        required to look into more substantial factors in the application of the
                        basic test. The present case involved a collision where, quite often, there
                        is no obvious or natural forum: see <em>The
                            Spiliada</em> at p.477C-D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    As we held earlier (see above at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>), the place of the tort was Indonesia.
                    Applying the <em>Albaforth</em> principle, Indonesia would,
                        <em>prima facie</em>, be the natural forum, at least
                    for the alternative tort claim. We were of the view that there was nothing on
                    the facts of this case to displace the <em>prima facie</em>
                    position. The place of the tort was not fortuitous. Indonesia was the place from
                    which the misrepresentations were made. Indonesia was also the place where
                    substantial acts in reliance of the misrepresentation took place: the Respondent
                    conducted drilling at the Pelaihari Concession because of the Appellants’
                    alleged misrepresentations. This is not to say that the <em>Albaforth</em> principle, whilst applicable in the context of the
                    present proceedings, is decisive in the present appeal. We were aware that the
                    Respondent’s claim in tort was framed as an <em>alternative</em> cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   General connections with Singapore and the payment of the
                Investment Funds in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Respondent placed considerable emphasis
                    on certain general connections that the parties have or have had with Singapore.
                    The Respondent also relied on the fact that the Investment Funds were paid into
                    Singapore bank accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    We did not consider these connections to be
                    relevant in stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test. The
                    general connections to Singapore and the payment of the Investment Funds into
                    Singapore bank accounts have no relevance to the claims that the Respondent has
                    framed. Only connections that are relevant to the disputes should be considered
                    in the <em>forum non conveniens</em> analysis (see, for
                    example, the decision of this court in <em>The Rainbow
                        Joy</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [52] and the English High
                    Court decision of <em>Vetco Gray UK Ltd v FMC Technologies
                        Inc</em>, [2007] EWHC 540 (Pat) at [26]). The underlying
                    purpose of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> analysis is to
                    determine whether there is a more appropriate forum, <em>viz</em>, one “in which the case may be tried more suitably
                    for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice” (see
                        <em>Spiliada</em> at 476), and the core inquiry is to
                    determine the place which has the “most real and substantial
                    connection” with the case (see <em>Spiliada</em> at
                    478). This purpose and core inquiry will not be advanced by considering
                    connecting factors that are not relevant to the dispute because those factors
                    are not really and substantially connected with the case at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on stage one of the <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Spiliada</span>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On the whole, we were satisfied that
                    Indonesia was clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore for
                    the trial of the claims concerned. Indonesia is the place where all the parties
                    have some connection that is relevant to the dispute. Although not a significant
                    factor in so far as the proximity of Indonesia to Singapore and the possibility
                    of obtaining evidence via video-link are concerned, we gave some weight to the
                    fact that the Appellants intend to call witnesses based in Indonesia. The
                    Appellants have also argued that they need to rely on Indonesian Witnesses who
                    may have to be compelled, and the Appellants will more likely be able to compel
                    these witnesses if the case was heard in Indonesia. In relation to the
                    alternative claim in tort, it was relevant that Indonesian law was the <em>lex loci delicti</em> and that the place of the tort was
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Although (as noted above) we considered that
                    UAE law might govern the Investment Agreement, this was not a factor in favour
                    of Singapore’s candidacy as the natural forum. It should be recalled that
                    the <em>forum non conveniens</em> analysis is a relative
                    one (see above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>). The choice in the
                    present proceedings was between Indonesia and Singapore. Between Indonesia and
                    Singapore, it would not be logical for us to consider that Singapore was the
                    natural forum simply because a third forum, the UAE, had a better or as strong a
                    claim as Indonesia as the natural forum. In this regard, we found the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Macsteel Commercial Holdings
                        (Pty) Ltd &amp; Anor v Thermasteel V (Canada)
                        Inc &amp; Anor</em> [1996] CLC 1403
                        (“<em>Macsteel</em>”), which the
                    Appellants discussed at length in their Appellants’ Case, to be a useful
                    illustration (incidentally, <em>Macsteel</em> was recently
                    considered by this court in <em>Siemens AG</em> (at [15])).
                        <em>Macsteel</em> was a case where the dispute had
                    links to Ontario and South Africa. The only link with England was that English
                    law was expressed to be the governing law of the contract. On those facts, the
                    court held that the action should be stayed even though both South Africa and
                    Ontario had <em>equally</em> strong links with the dispute.
                    The court considered it relevant that the parties were not arguing that the case
                    should be heard in South Africa. The only comparison was between England and
                    Ontario. As between England and Ontario, Ontario was the clearly more
                    appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In fact, the Singapore High Court case
                    adopted a similar approach to the English Court of Appeal in <em>Macsteel</em>. In <em>Lehman Brothers Special
                        Financing Inc v Hartadi Angkosubroto</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 664, the court considered that the natural forum was either
                    New York or Indonesia and not Singapore (at [35]). The High Court accordingly
                    granted the stay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Reference in this regard may also be made to
                    the following views of Prof Yeo, which were also reproduced above (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>) (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at para 75.089):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, if the parties have chosen not to have their dispute decided in
                        the foreign forum with the strongest connections with the case, and this
                        alternative forum is not put forward to the court for consideration, the
                        court is still obliged to consider whether any other forum put forward by
                        the defendant is a clearly more appropriate forum than Singapore. A more
                        difficult situation arises where the defendant applies to stay Singapore
                        proceedings on the basis that forum X is clearly more appropriate than
                        Singapore, while the plaintiff presents evidence that forum Y is clearly
                        more appropriate than either X or Singapore (but neither the plaintiff nor
                        the defendant is interested in litigating in Y). In principle, this does not
                        affect the proposition that the court should <em>prima
                            facie</em> stay the proceedings when the defendant has
                        demonstrated that there is a clearly more appropriate and available forum
                        elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    We were satisfied that, on a relative
                    analysis, Indonesia was clearly a more appropriate forum than Singapore.
                    Accordingly, stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> analysis
                    pointed firmly in favour of granting a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    It should be noted that no arguments were
                    proffered with respect to this particular limb of the test in the <em>Spiliada</em>. This was not surprising, in our view, having
                    regard to the relevant facts before us, and we therefore need say no more about
                    this particular limb.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    For the reasons set out above, it was clear
                    that Indonesia was clearly and more distinctly the appropriate forum for the
                    trial of the claims concerned. We therefore allowed the appeal with costs, and
                    with the usual consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    We would also like to take this opportunity
                    to commend both Mr Bull and Ms Gan for their clear arguments. In
                    particular, neither sought to either exaggerate or even embellish their
                    respective client’s cases but simply presented their arguments to this
                    court in as cogent and as persuasive a fashion as possible.</p>
