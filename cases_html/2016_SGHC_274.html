<div class="txt-body text-left">  NE 28 September 2016, at 30:12-14.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I rejected the submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 A transfer notice under Article 30 is in essence an offer by the proposing transferor to sell his shares to any member or selected person in accordance with the process set out in the Articles. If the offer is accepted, the proposing transferor becomes bound to sell the shares to the purchaser. There can be no transfer notice for purposes of Article 30 unless it was given with such intent. Otherwise, it cannot be said that there was any offer to sell.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, the Notice of Sale was not a transfer notice for purposes of Article 30 because it was clearly never intended to operate as such. The Notice of Sale had nothing to do with Article 30. In fact, it was not disputed that DVI had no knowledge of Article 30 when it issued the Notice of Sale. There was clearly no intention in the Notice of Sale to sell the Shares to any shareholder of Universal or to any selected person. It did not constitute Universal as DVI’s agent for the sale of the Shares. Instead the Notice of Sale clearly stated that the proposed sale was to GS Asia, that the proposed sale was pursuant to the order made by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court on 7 July 2004 and that the Notice of Sale was given in accordance with procedures set out in that order. It gave interested parties an opportunity to file objections if they so wished. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It was evident that the defendant himself did not treat the Notice of Sale as a transfer notice under the Articles. Nothing in the WST Letter suggested that the defendant was treating the Notice of Sale as a transfer notice. In addition, in response to the WST Letter, DVI informed Universal that it had withdrawn the Notice of Sale. A transfer notice under Article 30 cannot be withdrawn unilaterally. The defendant must have known of the withdrawal of the Notice of Sale yet he did not protest against the withdrawal. Neither did he inform DVI that he had already exercised his right of pre-emption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendant next referred me to <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott Ltd v Scott’s Trustees</span> [1959] AC 763 (“<span class="font-italic">Lyle  &amp; Scott</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott</span>, article 9 of the articles of association provided that any “ordinary shareholder who is desirous of transferring his ordinary shares shall inform the secretary in writing of the number of ordinary shares which he desires to transfer…”. The court held that shareholders who had entered into a binding agreement to sell their shares to a third party, and who had received the purchase price, must be deemed to be desirous of transferring them and were therefore bound to implement article 9 by issuing a transfer notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The defendant made two different submissions relying on <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott</span>. First, the defendant submitted that DVI’s proposal (in the Notice of Sale) to transfer the Shares to GS Asia showed a desire to sell the Shares and that this was sufficient to trigger the defendant’s right of pre-emption.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I disagreed with both submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my judgment, the defendant’s right of pre-emption could not arise unless there was a transfer notice given pursuant to Article 30. The language in Article 30 was clear. A mere desire to sell the Shares on the part of DVI could not and did not trigger the defendant’s right of pre-emption. <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott </span>did not support the defendant’s submission in this regard. The decision there was that the shareholders’ conduct showed they were desirous of selling their shares and that this fact triggered <span class="font-italic">their</span> <span class="font-italic">obligation to issue a transfer notice</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the defendant’s second submission, in my opinion, <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott </span>did not help the defendant’s case either. In the present case, the defendant did not seek an order requiring DVI to issue a transfer notice. More importantly, even if he had sought such an order, it would not have changed the fact that no transfer notice had been given and the defendant could not therefore have exercised any right of pre-emption whether in 2004 or 2007. This meant that the defendant would still have wrongfully converted the Shares when he caused them to be transferred to him in December 2007 and subsequently to Columbia Asia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In any event, I disagreed with the defendant’s submission that based on <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott</span>, DVI became bound, as a result of the Notice of Sale, to issue a transfer notice<span class="font-italic"> </span>to Universal. As already mentioned, the question in <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott </span>was whether the shareholders’ conduct in accepting the third party’s offer showed that they were desirous of transferring their shares thereby triggering the obligation to issue transfer notices. The fact that they had agreed to sell their shares and had received payment was the decisive factor in the court’s decision that their obligation to issue transfer notices had been triggered. Viscount Simonds was of the opinion (at 774) that “it is not open to a shareholder, <span class="font-italic">who has agreed to do a certain thing and is bound to do it</span>, to deny that he is desirous of doing it” [emphasis added]. Lord Reid drew a distinction between a shareholder who “merely says that he wishes to sell or does something which shows that that is his intention” and a shareholder “who has agreed to sell” (at 779). The obligation to issue a transfer notice would be triggered in the latter case but not in the former. Lord Reid went further to say (at 781) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under article 9 the [shareholders] are bound to give notices so long as they are desirous of selling their shares, and they must be held to be desirous of selling their shares so long as they maintain and do not annul their contracts with [the third party]. It is in their power to do that, and, once they have done so, they will be entitled to say that they are no longer desirous of transferring their shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Applying <span class="font-italic">Lyle &amp; Scott </span>to the present case, the question would be whether by issuing the Notice of Sale, DVI became a “person proposing to transfer” its shares within the meaning of Article 30 such that it became obliged to issue a transfer notice. In my view, the obligation to issue a transfer notice under Article 30 was not triggered because DVI was then clearly not bound to transfer the Shares to GS Asia. DVI was merely expressing an intention to sell to GS Asia and even then, this was subject to any objections that may be raised and to the Delaware Bankruptcy Court’s approval in any event. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the WST Letter was an exercise of the right of pre-emption  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In any event, in my view, the WST Letter did not constitute an exercise by the defendant of his rights of pre-emption under the Articles. An exercise of a right of pre-emption is an acceptance of the offer made by way of a transfer notice. Such an acceptance must be unequivocal. As seen earlier (at [9]), the WST Letter merely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) pointed out that Article 29 of the Articles prohibited DVI from selling to GS Asia (a non-member) because the defendant (a member) was prepared to buy the Shares; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) sought confirmation that DVI would offer to sell the Shares to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The WST Letter could not be construed as an unequivocal acceptance by the defendant. The WST Letter did not even treat the Notice of Sale as a transfer notice under Article 30. Neither did it refer to Articles 30 to 33 nor mention any exercise of a right of pre-emption. The WST Letter treated the situation as one which fell entirely within Article 29 alone; hence the request in the letter for confirmation that DVI would offer to sell the shares to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It was also clear that the defendant did not treat the WST Letter as an exercise of his right of pre-emption. First, if there was an exercise of the right of pre-emption, DVI would have been bound to transfer the Shares to the defendant. Article 33 of Universal’s Articles allowed Universal to receive and hold the purchase money from the defendant for DVI and to register the Shares in the defendant’s name if DVI defaulted in transferring the Shares. Yet, neither the defendant nor Universal asked DVI to transfer the Shares to the defendant. Neither was DVI informed of the registration of the Shares in the defendant’s name or of the fact that Universal was holding the payment for the Shares for DVI. Instead, what took place at the Universal board meeting on 14 December 2007 were hurried steps taken to transfer the Shares to the defendant without informing DVI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, on 14 December 2007, the defendant gave written notice to Universal, pursuant to Article 30, that he wished to purchase the Shares (see [17] above). If the defendant had (as he claimed) exercised his right of pre-emption through the WST Letter in 2004, there would have been no need for his written notice on 14 December 2007. Evidently, the defendant did not treat the WST Letter as an exercise of his right of pre-emption. In my view, the defendant’s assertion that he had exercised his right of pre-emption through the WST Letter was nothing more than an afterthought. I would add, for completeness, that the defendant could not rely on the notice given on 14 December 2007 as his exercise of his right of pre-emption because clearly (assuming the Notice of Sale was a transfer notice), the defendant’s notice on 14 December 2007 was given long after the 28-day period under Article 31 for Universal to find a buyer had expired.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff was estopped </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendant submitted that estoppel by representation can arise where one party keeps silent despite knowing that the other party is acting or proceeding with its course of conduct on the basis of a mistaken belief which the former is said to have acquiesced in: <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati 5” </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1114 at [17]. The defendant also relied on <span class="font-italic">Tradax Export S.A. v Dorada Compania Naviera S.A. (The “Lutetian”)</span> [1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 140 at 158 for the proposition that if one party to a contract knows that the other party mistakenly believes he has validly complied with a contractual term, the first party cannot simply keep silent and let the mistaken party continue to labour under the mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The defendant argued that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it was clear to DVI from the WST Letter that the defendant was exercising his right of pre-emption;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) DVI was therefore under a duty to inform the defendant if DVI felt that the Notice of Sale did not trigger Article 29 and/or that the requirements under the Articles were not complied with; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the DVI Email did not raise any such objections and was instead an acknowledgement that the defendant had exercised his right of pre-emption through the WST Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I rejected the defendant’s submissions.  In my view, the evidence did not support any estoppel by representation. As explained earlier, the WST Letter did not constitute an exercise of any right of pre-emption by the defendant. The WST Letter did not give DVI any reason to suspect, much less believe, that the defendant was purporting to exercise his right of pre-emption. In the circumstances, no estoppel by representation could possibly have arisen.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether DVI had the right to immediate possession of the Shares</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It was common ground that as DVI did not have actual possession of share certificate no. 8 at the time when the conversion took place, the plaintiff had to prove that DVI had the right to immediate possession of the Shares. The plaintiff relied on the fact that DVI was the registered holder of the Shares and submitted that this gave it the requisite right to immediate possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendant’s case was that the Shares had been pledged to MEC pursuant to the MEC Loan Agreement and consequently, GS Asia had taken over the pledge when it bought MEC’s rights under the MEC Loan Agreement. It was not disputed that DVI would not have had the right to immediate possession of the Shares on 14 December 2007 (when the Shares were transferred to and registered in the defendant’s name) if the Shares had in fact been pledged as security for the MEC Loan. However, the plaintiff disputed the pledge of the Shares to MEC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The defendant accepted that the burden was on him to prove that the Shares were pledged to MEC. However, he also submitted that for the plaintiff to prove its right to immediate possession of the Shares, the plaintiff could not just rely on its legal title but had to be able to explain why share certificate no. 8 was not in its possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I disagreed with the defendant. It is true that having title to a property does not necessarily mean having the right to immediate possession of the same. However, a plaintiff in a claim for conversion is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to rely on his title to prove his right to immediate possession. In the present case, it was undisputed that DVI was the registered holder of the Shares at the material time. As the registered holder of the Shares, <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>DVI was entitled to immediate possession of the Shares as against GS Asia. Since the defendant was the one alleging that DVI had lost its right to possession because the Shares were pledged to MEC/GS Asia, in my view, the burden fell squarely on the defendant to prove that the Shares were pledged to MEC/GS Asia. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Shares were pledged to MEC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Michael O’Hanlon (“O’Hanlon”) gave evidence for the defendant. O’Hanlon was the President and Chief Executive Officer of DVI in 2002.  O’Hanlon was also the former Chairman of MEC. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), O’Hanlon claimed that he had “insisted that a pledge of the [Shares] be executed in favour of MEC and held by them” until the MEC Loan was fully repaid. He also alleged that he was asked to sign the share mortgage on behalf of DVI and that share certificate no. 8 was placed in MEC’s custody as security under the MEC Loan Agreement.

</div> More importantly, O’Hanlon could not explain why it was necessary for DVI to pledge the Shares to MEC when DVI was MEC’s parent company. O’Hanlon kept changing his explanation and gave answers that contradicted his own testimony. His reasons for the pledge by DVI changed from exercising control in the event of default of the MEC Loan, to having all the shares in Universal located in Singapore, to assigning the Shares to MEC so that MEC, not DVI, held the Shares, and finally to facilitating the sale of the MEC Loan to a third party.

</div> O’Hanlon could not explain what the mistake in the pledge document was or how the mistake came about. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I rejected O’Hanlon’s testimony on the pledge of the Shares as I was driven to the conclusion that his evidence was simply not reliable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The defendant also relied on the fact that share certificate no. 8 was among the documents returned by A&amp;G (as solicitors for GS Asia) to MK&amp;P after GS Asia received payment under the GS Settlement Deed (see [21] above). There was no evidence as to when, how or why GS came to be in possession of share certificate no. 8. The defendant argued that GS Asia must have obtained possession of share certificate no. 8 because the Shares were pledged to MEC. The question was whether such an inference should be drawn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my view, the mere fact that A&amp;G was able to return share certificate no. 8 to the defendant’s solicitors, when viewed against the totality of the evidence, was insufficient to support an inference that the Shares had been pledged to MEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, it was undisputed that the Shares were given to MEC to enhance MEC’s yield in giving the MEC Loan to Universal. It did not make any sense whatsoever for the Shares to be pledged to MEC as security for the MEC Loan. The fact that the Shares were registered in DVI’s name did not make any difference. DVI was, after all, MEC’s parent company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Second, under the MEC Loan Agreement, the execution of the Share Mortgage Agreement was a condition precedent to the disbursement of the MEC Loan. The MEC Offer Letter, on the other hand, clearly envisaged transferring the Shares to MEC or its nominee only after the loan had been disbursed. Therefore, it could not have been intended that the Shares were to be mortgaged to MEC as part of the Share Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Third, the GS SPA set out the assets acquired by GS Asia. These assets included the Share Mortgage executed by the defendant, Edward Hong and Muliadi. The Share Mortgage was expressly named in the list of security documents. However, there was no mention of any pledge of the Shares anywhere in the GS SPA. If the Shares had been pledged to MEC, that fact would surely have been reflected in the GS SPA. The evidence showed that GS Asia did not consider DVI to be a security provider.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Fourth, the fact that the Notice of Sale envisaged the Shares being sold by DVI to GS Asia <span class="font-italic">unencumbered</span> was consistent with the fact that the Shares had not been pledged to MEC. There was also no mention of any such pledge in the draft sale agreement with GS Asia.

</div>
</div> The defendant was not entitled to make this argument as it was not his pleaded case in his defence. In any event, there was no evidence of any agreement or intention to create a pledge of the Shares to GS Asia in connection with the GS SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on conversion claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my judgment: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no valid exercise of a right of pre-emption by the defendant. DVI had not issued any transfer notice pursuant to Article 30 of the Articles. In any event, the WST Letter did not constitute a valid exercise of a right of pre-emption. Accordingly, the defendant had converted the Shares by wrongfully procuring the transfer of the Shares to himself.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff had the right to immediate possession of the Shares and was therefore entitled to bring the claim against the defendant for conversion. The Shares had not been pledged to MEC and consequently, GS Asia did not acquire any pledge over the Shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 My decision on the plaintiff’s claim for conversion meant that the plaintiff did not have to rely on its alternative claims for reversionary damage and unjust enrichment. For completeness however, I deal with both alternative claims below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reversionary damage claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff referred me to <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts </span>(Anthony Dugdal gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006), at paras 17-138 to 17-139, for the proposition that an owner of goods who lacks standing to sue in conversion (because he had neither possession nor an immediate right to possession of the goods) can bring an action for reversionary injury provided that the wrongful act deprived him either temporarily or permanently of the benefit of his reversionary interest. Actual damage is necessary; the goods must have been destroyed or seriously damaged or wrongfully disposed in a way that destroyed the owner’s title or at the very least reduced his chances of recovering his goods</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission that even if DVI lacked the standing to sue in conversion because the Shares had somehow been pledged to GS Asia, it was nevertheless entitled to relief because the defendant’s acts of conversion had deprived it of its reversionary interest in the Shares. In my view, the plaintiff suffered actual damage as, at the very least, its chances of recovering the Shares from Columbia Asia were significantly reduced. The evidence showed that Columbia Asia bought the Shares from the defendant as a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchase for value without notice of the defendant’s lack of title. The defendant had confirmed (through Eddie Foo) that he was entitled to complete his purchase of the Shares from DVI and subsequently, the Shares were registered in the defendant’s name. There was no allegation or evidence that Columbia had notice that the defendant’s title to the Shares was defective. In any event, there was no dispute that the plaintiff had suffered actual damage or that the elements of a claim for reversionary damage were made out in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s sole objection to the plaintiff’s claim for reversionary damage was that it was a separate cause of action from the claim for conversion and had not been specifically pleaded.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, the defendant did not identify specifically what was required to be, but had not been, pleaded. I agreed with the defendant that the claim for reversionary damage was a separate “cause of action” in the historical sense as it was a distinct tort from conversion (see <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v Intraco Ltd and others</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 at [30]–[31]). However, I concluded that it had been sufficiently pleaded as all the essential factual material necessary to support the claim had been pleaded (see <span class="font-italic">Multistar Holdings Ltd v Geocon Piling &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 2 SLR 1at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover the value of the Shares as damages for its reversionary damage claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Unjust enrichment claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff’s second alternative claim was that even if the plaintiff could not claim in conversion because it did not have the right to immediate possession of the Shares, it could still recover in unjust enrichment. It was common ground that the elements required to succeed in a claim in unjust enrichment are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Has the defendant had benefitted or been enriched?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the enrichment at the plaintiff’s expense? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Was the enrichment unjust? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Are there any defences?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Wee</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiew Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”) at [98]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On the facts as I have found them, there was no question that the defendant had been enriched at the plaintiff’s expense. The transfer of the Shares to the defendant (a) deprived DVI of the Shares that it owned and (b) clearly benefitted the defendant. DVI did not consent to the transfer to the defendant. The only question was whether the enrichment of the defendant was unjust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As the Court of Appeal reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>(at [134]), there is no freestanding claim in unjust enrichment on the abstract basis that it is “unjust” for the defendant to retain the benefit – there must be a particular recognised unjust factor or event which gives rise to a claim. The defendant referred to the list of “unjust factors” summarised in Prof Burrows, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Burrows</span>”) and in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>”), as set out in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span> at [132] and [133]. The defendant submitted that (a) the plaintiff’s claim did not fall within any of the recognised classes of unjust factors and (b) the plaintiff had not pleaded a recognised unjust factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 One of the unjust factors listed in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> is “lack of consent”<span class="font-italic">. </span>Prof Burrows<span class="font-italic"> </span>refers to “ignorance”. The Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>(at [139]) that there is no authority that has expressly acknowledged the unjust factor of ignorance or lack of consent. However, as it did not have to decide on this point in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>, the Court of Appeal did not express any conclusive opinion as to whether ignorance or lack of consent fell within the present catalogue of unjust factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 There is much force in the argument (which the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [139])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that if mistake (vitiation of consent) or failure of consideration (qualification of consent) can constitute unjust factors, the same conceptual justification must apply <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>where there is no consent. In my view, lack of consent ought to be recognised as an unjust factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the unjust factor was the lack of DVI’s consent when the defendant procured the transfer of the Shares to himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As for the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff failed to plead the unjust factor, in my view, the material facts had been sufficiently pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my view, the plaintiff would have succeeded in its claim in unjust enrichment and would have been entitled to recover the value of the Shares from the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation of damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In conversion, the measure of damages is the value of the goods at the time of conversion. The plaintiff relied on the consideration paid by Columbia Asia for 99% of the shares in Universal as evidence of the value of the Shares. The plaintiff computed the value of the Shares as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under the Columbia SSA,
