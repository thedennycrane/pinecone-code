        Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involved three separate appeals from
                    the district court by the three accused persons and the corresponding
                    cross-appeals by the prosecution. They arose from matters related to the
                    business of Sunshine Empire Pte Ltd (“Sunshine Empire”). For
                    convenience, I will identify the accused persons in the order in which they were
                    identified in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Phang Wah (“Phang”) and Jackie Hoo
                    Choon Cheat (“Hoo”) were charged with one charge under
                    s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (the “s 340 charge”) as well as with eight
                    charges under ss 409 read with 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (the “s 409 charges”). Phang and his wife, Neo
                    Kuon Huay (“Neo”), were tried for six charges under s 477A
                    read with s 109 of the Penal Code (the “s 477A charges”).
                    Where appropriate, Phang, Hoo and Neo are referred to as the
                    “appellants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After a joint trial, District Judge Jasvender
                    Kaur (“the DJ”) convicted all three appellants on their respective
                    charges (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Phang </em><em>Wah and others</em> [2010] SGDC 505
                        (“<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                        (DC)</em>”). The DJ sentenced Phang to a total of 9
                    years’ imprisonment and to pay an aggregate fine of $60,000. She sentenced
                    Hoo to a total of 7 years’ imprisonment and imposed on Neo an aggregate
                    fine of $60,000. Phang and Hoo appealed against their convictions and the
                    sentences imposed while Neo appealed only against her conviction. The
                    Prosecution cross-appealed against the sentences imposed on all three
                    appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The facts in the present case will be summarised
                    under the three groups of charges brought against the appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the s 340 charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The charge here was that Phang and Hoo were
                    knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of Sunshine Empire for the
                    fraudulent purpose of selling certain packages yielding returns when in fact
                    Sunshine Empire did not operate any substantive profit generating business and
                    had no sustainable means of funding such returns and they thereby committed an
                    offence punishable under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies
                    Act. At the trial, the parties agreed to proceed on the basis of an agreed
                    statement of facts which was admitted under s 376 of the Criminal Procedure
                    Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed). The agreed facts were set out at length by
                    the DJ (see <em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                        (DC)</em> at [7]-[36]) and I need only mention them briefly
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sunshine Empire was incorporated on 18 July
                    2003 as Niutrend International Pte Ltd (“NTI”). From
                    1 January 2006, Hoo and one Lee Wai Kin acquired the shares from the former
                    shareholders and were appointed as directors of NTI. On 8 January 2007, NTI
                    was renamed as Sunshine Empire. The authorised signatories to Sunshine
                    Empire’s bank accounts were (a) Phang singly or (b) Neo and one Low Wei
                    Ling (Phang’s personal assistant) jointly. Phang was paid consultancy and
                    other fees to provide advice on the management and business of Sunshine Empire.
                    Payment vouchers were prepared by either Low Wei Ling or Chan Jean Yi
                    (“Jean Yi”) (a member of the accounting staff) and approved by
                    either Phang or Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sunshine Empire was a multi-level marketing
                    (“MLM”) business which sold lifestyle packages comprising:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, a seasonal promotion product
                        from e-Mall (an e-commerce platform). The only product sold was call-back
                        services by <em>EM-Call</em> (“EM-Call talk
                        time”). EM-Call talk time was introduced in June 2007 and was given
                        to all participants in the Sunshine Empire scheme, even those who had signed
                        up before the introduction of EM-Call talk time. EM-Call basically
                        functioned by converting outgoing calls into incoming calls, enabling users
                        with free incoming call phone plans to reduce their mobile phone charges for
                        local and overseas calls. Any unused EM-Call talk time purchased under the
                        prime packages would expire each month. Although EM-Call talk time could be
                        sold by Sunshine Empire participants to others, participants were unable to
                        purchase additional EM-Call talk time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, <em>e-Points</em>, which were
                        exchangeable for cash at the rate of $1.60 per e-Point, subject to an
                        administration fee of 5 e-Points or 0.5% of the amount converted. Some
                        conditions on the use of e-Points were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       E-Points could be used to
                            purchase additional merchant and prime packages at a rate of $1.60 per
                            e-Point or transferred to the e-Mall account to purchase products on
                            e-Mall.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       E-Points could be transferred between
                        participants.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       E-Points could not be converted into mall
                        points.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_7-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       E-Points could not be purchased by participants and could only be
                            earned through the Sunshine Empire compensation plan (on which, see
                                <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> below) and/or through
                            Consumer Rebate Privileges (“CRP”) (on which, see
                                <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, <em>mall points</em>, which participants could
                        use to redeem products from e-Mall platform. Mall points could not be
                        converted into cash or e-Points and could not be transferred from one
                        participant to another. Mall points could not be purchased by participants
                        and could only be earned through the Sunshine Empire compensation plan (on
                        which, see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> below) and/or by
                        purchasing lifestyle packages.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, from July 2007, participants were also allowed to
                        sell their products on the <em>e-Mall
                        platform</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Sunshine Empire compensation plan rewarded
                    participants with e-Points and mall points for the purchase of lifestyle
                    packages or for sponsoring others in the purchase of lifestyle packages.
                    Participants would receive their e-Points and mall points in their Sunshine
                    Empire bank account (the “e-Bank account”). To purchase the
                    products, participants had to transfer their mall points and/or e-Points from
                    their e-Bank account to their e-Mall account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Members of the public became participants of the
                    Sunshine Empire scheme by registering with Sunshine Empire and being sponsored
                    by an existing participant. Such participants had to first become a Merchant
                    Affiliate for a registration fee of 25 e-Points or $40. Merchant Affiliates were
                    provided with Merchant Agreement contracts. Each lifestyle package was supported
                    by a 7-day cooling off period from the date of sale, plus a 100% 60-day money
                    back retail guarantee of satisfaction. From July 2007, a Merchant Affiliate
                    received a free starter kit and free mentoring by the leaders of Sunshine
                    Empire. The starter kit contained Sunshine Empire’s business model,
                    compensation plan and policy guide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     A concise summary of the different types of
                    lifestyle packages available suffices for the purposes of the present judgment.
                    Briefly, a Merchant Affiliate was entitled to purchase a lifestyle package
                        (<em>ie</em> Bronze Merchant or Silver Merchant; where
                    necessary, generically referred to as “Merchant package”). If a
                    Merchant Affiliate purchased a Merchant package, he would be entitled to
                    purchase prime packages (<em>ie</em> Bronze Prime, Silver
                    Prime or Gold Prime; where necessary, generically referred to as “Prime
                    package”). The main differences between a Merchant package and a Prime
                    package were the cost of the packages (the Prime packages being more expensive),
                    the EM-Call talk time available (the Prime packages offering more EM-Call talk
                    time) and the entitlement to CRP (only Prime package participants were entitled
                    to CRP).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Some elaboration on CRP is necessary. Phang
                    and Hoo agreed that CRP was a privilege offered to Prime package participants
                    and was intended to be an incentive to participants. CRP was paid on a monthly
                    basis. Between August 2006 and December 2006, the equivalent of CRP was termed
                    “profit-sharing”; CRP was only adopted as the scheme’s name
                    in January 2007. In order to ensure compliance with Singapore laws, Phang and
                    Hoo consulted a lawyer, Francis Goh, on the CRP scheme. Both Phang and Hoo
                    insisted that CRP was a non-guaranteed payment with the amount payable being at
                    the discretion of Sunshine Empire. They also confirmed that CRP was funded from
                    the sale of lifestyle packages, although this fact was not brought explicitly
                    (if at all) to the attention of the participants of the Sunshine Empire
                    scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Between August 2006 and October 2007, a total
                    of 25,773 lifestyle packages were sold by Sunshine Empire (2,836 Bronze
                    Merchant, 4,002 Silver Merchant, 268 Bronze Prime, 1,883 Silver Prime and 16,784
                    Gold Prime). The prices of the packages were generally on an upward trend over
                    those months. The total revenue was about $175m and the total CRP payouts were
                    about $107m. Some US$5.1m were paid by Sunshine Empire as consultancy,
                    management and event fees to a Hong Kong company in which Phang and one Ignatius
                    Yong Wai Hong were directors. Sunshine Empire also paid more than US$6.97m to a
                    company in which Hoo and Neo were directors for the purchase of mall points.
                    This company paid a third company some US$5.9m for the purchase of EM-call talk
                    time. Phang and the said Ignatius Yong Wai Hong were also directors of this
                    third company. In addition, Sunshine Empire made a number of loans to the third
                    company (almost $16m) and various other interest-free loans to others.
                    Everything came to a halt after the Commercial Affairs Department
                    (“CAD”) raided the premises of Sunshine Empire on 13 November
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the s 409 charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     These charges against Phang and Hoo were for
                    criminal breach of trust (“CBT”) as agents, alleging that the two
                    men had engaged in a conspiracy to commit such CBT by causing Sunshine Empire to
                    make payments to Neo on eight occasions totalling S$947,904.88 based on 1% of
                    the preceding monthly sales, purportedly as a Group Sales Director
                    (“GSD”), when they knew that Neo was not qualified as a GSD. It
                    was undisputed that Phang and Hoo had agreed to pay Neo a total of S$947,904.88
                    and that these monies were paid on 8 occasions, <em>ie</em>
                    on a monthly basis from November 2006 to June 2007. Hoo authorised the issuance
                    of the 8 cheques and Phang signed the cheques. The payments were recorded as
                    sales incentives and were based on 1% of Sunshine Empire’s monthly
                    turnover. According to Phang and Hoo, the payments were made on the basis that
                    Neo was a GSD of Sunshine Empire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The criteria for appointment as a Sunshine
                    Empire GSD were specified in the Sunshine Empire starter kit. Briefly, to be
                    appointed as a GSD, the criteria are “Minimum 10,000 MCF, Promote 3 x
                    BRM”. MCF referred to Merchant Car Funds and BRM was the abbreviation for
                    Business Regional Manager. It was also explicitly stated in the starter kit that
                    the appointee “will have to undergo interview and application is subject
                    to Sunshine Empire final approval in its discretion”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Phang and Hoo testified that they regarded Neo
                    as a GSD because she met the qualifying requirements. However, Neo was not told
                    that she had been appointed as a GSD. Phang testified that Neo’s name was
                    not selected by the computer system which generated the names of persons who
                    qualified. In other words, Neo was not recognised by Sunshine Empire’s
                    computer systems to have the level of sales or the number of managers required
                    to be a GSD. However, allegedly because Neo had brought in a huge network to
                    Sunshine Empire, Phang suggested Neo’s appointment to Hoo and Hoo agreed
                    to regard Neo as a GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the s 477A charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     These charges against Phang and Neo alleged a
                    conspiracy to falsify the payments made by Sunshine Empire by means of payment
                    vouchers made out to Phang when the payments were actually meant for Neo. With
                    regard to the payment vouchers arising from the 1% monthly payments made to Neo
                    (allegedly as a GSD), Neo suggested that the vouchers should be prepared in her
                    name for one month and in Phang’s name the following month. Neo confirmed
                    that she had told Jean Yi from the accounts department that she wanted such an
                    alternate-month payment arrangement to be done because her income tax liability
                    was high and she wanted to reduce that liability. She also claimed that she
                    wanted Phang to declare a higher income for tax purposes in order for him to be
                    eligible to obtain credit. Six payment vouchers were falsified in
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     17The DJ convicted Phang and Hoo on the s 340 charge for carrying on
                    the business of Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent purpose as well as on the
                    s 409 charges for CBT as an agent. The DJ also convicted Phang and Neo on
                    the s 477A charges of engaging in a conspiracy to disguise six of the
                    payments (which were the subject-matter of the s 409
                charges).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The appellants were sentenced as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Phang was sentenced to 4 years 6
                        months’ imprisonment for the s 340 charge, to imprisonment terms
                        ranging from 15 to 30 months for the s 409 charges, and a fine of
                        $10,000 for each of the six s 477A charges. The imprisonment terms for
                        the s 340 charge and for two of the s 409 charges (24 months and
                        30 months) were ordered to run consecutively making a total sentence of 9
                        years and $60,000. The fines have been paid and he is on bail pending these
                        appeals;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hoo
                        was sentenced to 3 years 6 months’ imprisonment for the s 340
                        charge and to imprisonment terms ranging from 9 months to 24 months for the
                        s 409 charges. The imprisonment terms for the s 340 charge and for
                        two of the s 409 charges (18 months and 24 months) were ordered to run
                        consecutively making a total of 7 years. He is on bail pending these
                        appeals; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neo was sentenced to a fine of $10,000 for each of the six s 477A
                        charges, making a total fine of $60,000. She has paid the
                    fines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>), Phang and Hoo appealed against their respective
                    convictions and sentences while Neo appealed only against her
                conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The issues before this court are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether Phang and Hoo had knowingly
                        carried on the business of Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent purpose, in
                        contravention of s 340 of the Companies Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether Phang and Hoo had made
                        unlawful payments to Neo, in contravention of s 409 of the Penal
                        Code;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether
                        Phang and Neo had, wilfully and with intent to defraud, falsified payment
                        vouchers in contravention of s 477A of the Penal Code;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the
                        sentences imposed were manifestly excessive (as contended by Phang and Hoo)
                        or manifestly inadequate (as submitted by the
                prosecution).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is not in dispute that an appellate court
                    customarily exercises great caution in evaluating factual findings and will not
                    interfere with a trial judge’s findings unless they are plainly wrong
                        (<em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    1 SLR(R) 1 at [22]). If an
                    appellate court wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision, it must not
                    merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that
                    it is wrong (<em>ibid</em>). Bearing this in mind, I turn
                    now to analyse the first issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 340 charge</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 340 of the Companies Act
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Responsibility for fraudulent
                            trading</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">340.—(1) If, in the course of the winding up of a company
                        or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that <em>any business of the company has been carried on</em>
                        with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any
                        other person or <em>for any fraudulent purpose</em>,
                        the Court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or
                        contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper to do so, declare
                        that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the
                        business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any

                        liabilities of the company as the Court directs. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) Where any business of a company is carried on with the
                        intent or for the purpose mentioned in subsection (1), <em>every person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on
                            of the business with that intent or purpose shall be guilty of an

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For the purposes of the Penal Code, the term
                    “fraudulently” is defined in s 25 of the same thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Fraudulently</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>25</b>.    A person is
                            said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with
                                <em>intent to defraud</em>, but not
                            otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Phang and Hoo were charged under the second
                    limb of s 340, <em>viz</em>, for carrying on a
                    business for any fraudulent purpose (see emphasis added in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). In <em>Phang
                        </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [253], the DJ noted
                    that the term “fraudulent purpose” connotes an intention to go
                    “beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business
                    would regard as honest” (<em>R v Grantham</em>
                    [1984] QB 675) or involving “according to the current notions
                    of fair trading among commercial men, real moral blame” (<em>Re Patrick Lyon Ltd</em> [1933] Ch 786 at
                    790).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The issue to be determined was therefore
                    whether Sunshine Empire was perpetrating a fraud on the participants of the
                    Sunshine Empire scheme and whether Phang and Hoo knew that they were
                    perpetrating such a fraud. As the DJ correctly cautioned, the fact that the
                    Sunshine Empire scheme would not have worked was not sufficient by itself to
                    establish dishonesty, since over-optimistic and honest businessmen could have
                    miscalculated their moves without being dishonest (<em>Phang
                        </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [256]). In the end, a
                    finding of dishonesty on the part of Phang and Hoo was required, with knowledge
                    here encompassing also a situation of turning a blind eye to the
                obvious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The DJ eventually found that Sunshine Empire
                    was an unsustainable business and that Phang and Hoo were knowingly perpetrating
                    a fraud on the participants by the operation of the Sunshine Empire scheme
                        (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em>
                    at [274]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Counsel for Phang and for Hoo raised numerous
                    arguments that challenged the DJ’s conviction of Phang and Hoo on the
                    s 340 charge. The arguments may be classified for convenience into two
                    major categories, <em>viz</em> (1) that Sunshine
                    Empire’s business model had been wrongly found to be
                    “unsustainable”; and (2) that <em>even
                        if</em> Sunshine Empire’s business model was unsustainable, it
                    did not mean that Phang and Hoo had run Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent
                    purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Sunshine Empire’s business was unsustainable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With regard to the former category of
                    arguments, Phang and Hoo submitted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, unlike in a
                        “Ponzi” scheme where an investor places money into the scheme
                        on the <em>guarantee</em> of a high rate of return and
                        where no real products or services to generate profit or returns are
                        involved, Sunshine Empire <em>did not</em> promise any
                        returns (as all CRP payouts were non-guaranteed and fully discretionary) and
                        did in fact provide real products and services in the form of EM-Call talk
                        time and the e-Mall platform. Indeed, Sunshine Empire could be seen as a
                        legitimate MLM business selling tangible and measurable products and
                        services in accordance with the MLM legislation. Counsel for Phang and for
                        Hoo raised further detailed arguments as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The DJ placed a wrong focus
                            on CRP payouts and failed to appreciate that Sunshine Empire could have,
                            at any time, decided not to distribute any of the profits for any
                            reason. They pointed out that had Sunshine Empire refused to declare any
                            CRP benefits, no participant could lay a claim against Sunshine Empire
                            because it had no liability to pay any CRP benefits. This last-mentioned
                            point was buttressed by the fact that no complaint against Sunshine
                            Empire was ever made on the issue of CRP payouts for the 15 months or so
                            of its operations. It was further argued that the DJ failed to realise
                            that historical performance was no guarantee of future performance,
                                <em>viz</em>, the fact that Sunshine Empire had
                            paid out CRP at high rates in the first 15 months did not mean it would
                            continue to do the same or to the same extent in the future. Finally, it
                            was pointed out that CRP was capped at a maximum of 50% of the previous
                            month’s revenue and, accordingly, CRP payouts were <em>always sustainable</em> because they were always
                            based on a <em>subset of the revenue
                            received</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The DJ wrongly assumed that just because a
                            participant could potentially receive an amount far in excess of the
                            amount initially paid for the products and services, it necessarily
                            meant that the only source of “returns” had to be payments
                            by new entrants. In other words, the DJ failed to see the link of
                                <em>realised profit</em> between <em>profit sharing</em> and the <em>sale
                                of products and services</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Sunshine Empire was never in a
                        state of insolvent trading; indeed, the objective evidence was that Sunshine
                        Empire was making huge and increasing levels of profit such that it had
                        sufficient excess to channel into various loans, projects and
                        investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the DJ’s finding of unsustainability was premised on the
                        flawed evidence of the prosecution’s expert, Luke Steadman
                        (“Steadman”), a chartered accountant based in London and an
                        expert in forensic accounting. Phang and Hoo contended that the DJ should
                        instead have accepted the evidence of the defence’s expert, Wilfred Wu
                        Shek Chun (“Wu”), an accountant from Hong Kong. In this
                        regard, Phang and Hoo contended that Steadman erred in several ways,
                        including the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       Steadman should not have
                            adopted a “cost” approach, <em>viz</em> ascribing value to the components of each lifestyle
                            package (<em>ie</em> mall points, EM-Call talk
                            time, <em>etc</em>) to determine how each
                            participant valued the potential of obtaining returns from CRP (such
                            value being derived from the amount unaccounted for by the various
                            components of the lifestyle package). This is because adequacy of
                            consideration should not be a relevant consideration and the true value
                            of the products and services was <em>the amount that the
                                participants</em> were willing to pay for
                        them.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Steadman should not have used the Internal Rate of Return
                            (“IRR”) model to calculate the attractiveness of returns
                            to an investor <em>vis-à-vis</em> investment
                            decisions, because Sunshine Empire did not promise any financial return
                            from the purchase of lifestyle packages.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Steadman wrongly disregarded
                            e-Points in determining whether the Sunshine Empire business was
                            sustainable. Contrary to Steadman’s view, e-Point sales do not
                            result in Sunshine Empire replacing a liability (<em>eg</em> $12,000 for a Gold Prime package) for a greater
                            liability (<em>eg</em> $19,200 payouts for a
                            purchaser of a Gold Prime package) because Sunshine Empire was under no
                            obligation to pay out CRP. Furthermore, Steadman was wrong to suggest
                            that e-Point sales did not bring in new cash to Sunshine Empire, since
                            although the net amount of cash retained by Sunshine Empire remained the
                            same, liabilities decreased, leading to an increase in net
                            assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Phang and Hoo ran Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent
                purpose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With regard to the latter category of
                    arguments, Phang and Hoo argued that the fact that a business was assessed
                        <em>ex post facto</em> to be unsustainable would not
                    necessarily mean that it was fraudulent or that its founders knew or intended it
                    to be unsustainable at the time of inception of such a business model. In this
                    regard, counsel for Phang and Hoo pointed out that when the CAD raided Sunshine
                    Empire in November 2007, the CAD itself had no basis for believing that the
                    business model of Sunshine Empire was unsustainable, as evidenced by the fact
                    that Steadman’s report was only ready about 21 months later in July 2009.
                    Further, Wu disagreed with Steadman’s assessment of the sustainability of
                    the business. It would thus have been impossible for Phang and Hoo to foretell,
                    as at August 2006 (when they started to operate the Sunshine Empire business
                    model), what a forensic accountant might opine about their business model in
                    July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Phang and Hoo also took issue with the
                    DJ’s finding that the concept of CRP was deliberately obfuscated with
                    reference to the consumption on e-Mall and global turnover to make participants
                    believe that there was a viable source of profits to fund the CRP returns. They
                    argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Sunshine Empire did in fact
                        have a viable source of profits from the sale of its packaged products and
                        services. As mentioned above, each and every sale of the lifestyle package
                        of products and services gave Sunshine Empire a minimum 55% gross profit,
                        which was in turn used to fund CRP payouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the reference to consumption on the
                        e-Mall platform was meant to ensure that the description of Sunshine
                        Empire’s business in the legal documentation complied fully with the
                        MLM legislation and was never meant to confuse participants about the source
                        of CRP.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the reference to CRP as being based on Sunshine Empire’s
                        “global turnover” was accurate. Although it was true that CRP
                        payouts in Singapore would be based on the sales in Singapore, this did not
                        mean that CRP payments had nothing to do with global turnover. Global
                        turnover did affect Phang’s discretion and was a consideration in
                        deciding how much CRP payments were to be paid out in each country.
                        Therefore, although the source of CRP payout in Singapore was derived from
                        the sales in Singapore, Hoo asserted that it was, nonetheless,
                        strictly-speaking based on Sunshine Empire’s global turnover.
                        Accordingly, the description was accurate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, there was no duty for Sunshine Empire to
                        inform participants on the source of funding CRP if in fact there was a
                        valid source to fund CRP. The Sunshine Empire participants were <em>stakeholders</em>, <em>not
                            shareholders</em> in Sunshine Empire. There was thus no obligation
                        on the part of Sunshine Empire to account to them on the source of funding
                        CRP if there was a valid source to fund CRP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Finally, counsel for Hoo argued that Hoo had
                    relied on the vastly experienced and capable Phang, as well as sophisticated
                    computer software, to monitor the company’s performance. In this regard,
                    Hoo pointed out that Phang went into full-time MLM in 1990 and had for 10 years
                    prior to that been involved in part-time MLM, <em>ie</em>,
                    that Phang had around 30 years of experience in MLM. Phang was also hugely
                    successful in managing MLM businesses, with his company becoming one of the top
                    3 MLM companies in Southeast Asia. By contrast, Hoo claimed that he was new to
                    managing MLM companies and was accordingly well justified in relying on Phang
                    and the computer systems. Therefore, Hoo argued, even if Sunshine Empire’s
                    business was somehow unsustainable, he would not have known that was the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In summary, Phang and Hoo contended that the
                    prosecution had failed to prove <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> beyond reasonable doubt because Sunshine Empire was
                    operating a highly profitable, sustainable, fully solvent and legitimate MLM
                    business. They also contended that the Prosecution had failed to prove <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> beyond reasonable
                    doubt because Sunshine Empire did not obfuscate the source of CRP to anyone,
                    whether to its legal advisor or to its participants. Hoo additionally argued
                    that even if Sunshine Empire was running a fraudulent business, he did not know
                    this because he had relied on Phang’s judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Sunshine Empire’s business was unsustainable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The key plank in Phang’s and Hoo’s
                    argument was that CRP was non-guaranteed and that the DJ erred in accepting
                    Steadman’s analysis based on historical payout in finding that Sunshine
                    Empire was an unsustainable business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is some merit in this argument, insofar
                    as Sunshine Empire was not legally bound to pay out CRP at the rates it had been
                    paying for the 15 months in question (or at all). However, one cannot rely
                    solely on a legalistic view of Sunshine Empire’s business model. While
                    making a business decision to enter into a contract is undoubtedly influenced by
                    the legally binding terms of the contract, such business decisions are also
                    often influenced by other extra-legal considerations, such as a particular
                    contracting party’s consistent business practices (and, it must be
                    emphasised, regardless of whether that party was legally bound to continue such
                    practices or not).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For the avoidance of doubt, I am not here
                    making any allusion to the concept of implied terms, which constitute legally
                    binding (albeit unwritten) terms of the contract. I am, instead, merely stating
                    that it is important to be cognisant of all the circumstances of the case,
                    including Sunshine Empire’s consistent business practice (quite apart from
                    their legal obligations) in determining whether the Sunshine Empire business was
                    being carried on for a fraudulent purpose. On the facts, it was clear that CRP
                    constituted a very high proportion of Sunshine Empire’s revenue, that the
                    high rates of CRP payout were paid for by the sale of new packages (it was
                    undisputed that 99% of the revenue of Sunshine Empire came from the sale of
                    packages) (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC) at
                        [275]</em>) and, crucially, that there was a consistently high level
                    of payout over 15 months, leading to a return of 160%. The irresistible
                    inference that is drawn is that the highly attractive feature of Sunshine
                    Empire’s lifestyle packages is their historical payout, notwithstanding
                    that Sunshine Empire was not legally bound to continue paying out at high rates
                    or at all. On the evidence, it had to be blatantly obvious to Phang and Hoo that
                    if CRP had been stopped or reduced significantly, the enticing glitter of the
                    packages would have faded almost immediately and further sales thereof would
                    have been severely affected, thereby cutting off the life blood of the scheme.
                    There was no credible alternative source of revenue despite the allusions to
                    vague future business plans and some minor <em>ad hoc</em>
                    investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At this juncture, I turn to consider
                    Phang’s and Hoo’s related argument that there may be conceptual
                    difficulties with the “cost” approach adopted by the DJ (see
                    [28(c)(i)] above). Their argument is that from an economist’s perspective,
                    it is arguable that the value of a package is the amount that a participant was
                    willing to pay for it, rather than a piecemeal valuation of the individual
                    components within the package. To support this argument, Phang and Hoo pointed
                    out that adequacy of consideration was not a relevant factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, I see merit in taking the
                    “value” of the individual components into consideration. Such a
                    hypothetical valuation based on a reasonable market value would provide some
                    indication as to the motivations of the purchaser in buying the product,
                    especially where the purchase price paid far exceeds the reasonable market value
                    of the product. A very simple example illustrates this point: it is highly
                    unlikely that a reasonable purchaser would be willing to pay Company X $10,000
                    for a product that is similar to that sold by Company Y at a mere $1,000, unless
                    there are exceptional circumstances (for instance, very attractive fringe
                    benefits or some sentimental or familial link to the seller) which draw the
                    purchaser to Company X.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Returning to the facts of the present case, it
                    is undisputed that the Gold Prime package was the most popular package. More
                    than 65% of the packages purchased (16,784 out of 25,773 packages) were Gold
                    Prime packages, notwithstanding that such packages were by far the most
                    expensive packages available and that there was no real additional benefit in
                    the Gold Prime package over the other Prime packages, save for some additional
                    EM-Call talk time and the prospect of getting a higher return in CRP. In
                    purchasing a Gold Prime package, a participant would have spent $12,000 to get
                    15,000 mall points worth at most $1,200 (<em>ie</em> 10% of
                    package price), 2,100 minutes of monthly talk time (worth 4% of the package
                    price under Steadman’s formulation or 10% of the package price under
                    Wu’s formulation) and the e-Point bonus for purchasing packages (6% of
                    package price). Although the valuation exercise just conducted may run into the
                    technical difficulties highlighted <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    “cost” approach, such an exercise makes it patently clear that the
                    various components of the packages would have constituted only a small
                    proportion of what a reasonable participant would have spent on a package.
                    Reasoning by analogy to the example I raised regarding Companies X and Y, it
                    would make little sense for a participant to spend $12,000 on a Gold Prime
                    package to get products worth at most 26% of that value, unless there are some
                    exceptional circumstances motivating such a decision. In the present case, it
                    was clear that the exceptional circumstance was that of the prospect of a higher
                    CRP payout, which was consistently providing returns of about 160% over 15
                    months, notwithstanding that Sunshine Empire was not legally bound to continue
                    paying out at this rate (or at all). This finding is supported by the evidence
                    of the prosecution and defence witnesses who testified that they were drawn to
                    the scheme by the prospect of high returns, something totally unsurprising and
                    entirely reasonable. While some of the defence witnesses testified that they
                    participated for other reasons (<em>eg</em> the
                    attractiveness of the e-Mall platform), the DJ rightly pointed out that the
                    credibility of some of these witnesses were affected by prior inconsistent
                    statements given by them showing that they had in fact participated in the
                    scheme for the high payouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I address two other issues related to the
                    evidence given by the experts. First, I am not convinced by Wu’s assertion
                    that IRR should not be used because the Sunshine Empire model is not an
                    investment scheme. Instead, I agree with Steadman that the IRR is used merely to
                    compute financial attractiveness of a particular scheme and provide some basis
                    for comparison, regardless of whether the scheme was strictly speaking an
                    “investment” scheme or not. Second, I am also unconvinced by
                    Wu’s assertion that e-Point sales should be regarded as actual sales (and
                    should therefore be considered revenue as well). It was clear that no additional
                    cash was brought into Sunshine Empire when e-Points were used to purchase
                    packages. Indeed, as the Prosecution pointed out, Wu maintained the somewhat
                    artificial position that e-Point sales should be considered as cash even if
                    nothing but e-Point sales occurred month after month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Finally, I note that despite Phang and
                    Hoo’s insistence that CRP was capped at a maximum of 50% of the previous
                    month’s revenue (see [28(a)(i)] above), Sunshine Empire’s historical
                    record revealed that it continued to pay CRP at a level which breached this
                    threshold consistently from February 2007 (<em>Phang
                        </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [300]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the circumstances, I agree entirely with
                    the DJ’s finding that Sunshine Empire’s business was clearly
                    unsustainable. As the prosecution pointed out, in October 2007 (just before the
                    CAD raid in November that year), around $21m was received by Sunshine Empire but
                    over $25m was paid out. It was clear that collapse of the Sunshine Empire scheme
                    was inevitable. However, as was noted above, the fact that its business was
                    unsustainable would not by itself establish the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> requirement for the s 340
                    charge. I therefore turn now to examine whether Phang and Hoo had the requisite
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> for the
                    purposes of the s 340 charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Phang and Hoo ran Sunshine Empire for a fraudulent
                purpose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I also agree with the DJ’s finding that
                    the concept of CRP had been deliberately obfuscated with reference to the
                    consumption on the e-Mall platform and “global turnover” to make
                    participants believe that there was a viable source of profits to fund CRP
                    returns (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                        (DC)</em> at [288]). Some of the reasons which compel me to agree with
                    the DJ’s finding are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Phang had admitted that
                        participants were not informed that CRP returns were paid from revenue from
                        the sale of packages. Instead, participants were informed that the returns
                        were from the consumption on e-Mall (<em>Phang
                            </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [283]). When Hoo
                        was testifying on this point, the DJ found his evidence to be guarded,
                        evasive and vague (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [284]). Although Hoo acknowledged that it was
                        nowhere stated that CRP returns were paid from sales of packages, he
                        persisted in his contention that the references to privileges being
                        “dependent on the Sunshine Empire worldwide performance” and
                        “based on 10% of Sunshine Empire’s global turnover on the
                        e-mall platform” were sufficient to let the participants know how CRP
                        returns were funded (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [284]). I note that on appeal Hoo argued that
                        “global turnover” affected Phang’s discretion and was a
                        consideration in deciding how much CRP payments were to be paid out (see
                        above at [30(c)]). However, this appears contrived as it was an argument
                        raised in submissions rather than in evidence by Hoo when he was on the
                        witness stand. Furthermore, it would have been considerably easier and more
                        accurate for Sunshine Empire to have stated that the privileges were
                        “dependent on the Sunshine Empire’s ability to secure sales of
                        new packages”. The failure to make such a statement, coupled with the
                        decision to make references to grand concepts such as “worldwide
                        performance” and “global turnover”, showed that the
                        concept of CRP was indeed deliberately obfuscated.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, on the evidence, even senior
                        distributors like Liew Chiew Lan (see also [54(b)(iii)] where she is
                        referred to again) did not know that CRP was funded from the sale of
                        packages (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                            (DC)</em> at [285]). A number of witnesses (both prosecution and
                        defence witnesses) confirmed that they were told about projects overseas and
                        that they consequently believed that CRP returns were from the projects
                            (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                            (DC)</em> at [286]). Indeed, some participants were even offered
                        free air tickets to Taiwan to see the development of the so-called Taichung
                        project (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                            (DC)</em> at [286]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the legal advisor involved in drafting the
                        documentation, Goh, was not given the details on how CRP was funded
                            (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah
                            (DC)</em> at [287]). Goh testified that he did not give legal
                        advice on the operations of Sunshine Empire’s business as he did not
                        know the business and how the CRP rebates were being
                funded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Therefore, the fact that the Sunshine Empire
                    scheme was apparently drafted in consultation with a legal advisor in conformity
                    with the MLM legislation does not affect the s 340 charge. The affixation
                    of tinsels and other decorations (by way of mall points and EM-Call talk time)
                    as well as the making of vague references to “worldwide
                    performance”, “global turnover” and various international
                    projects were disingenuous – it was part of a well thought-out scheme
                    designed to defraud participants under an aura of legitimacy and
                    respectability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In conclusion, I agree that both the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> and <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> elements in
                    respect of the s 340 charge were made out beyond reasonable doubt and the
                    DJ was correct in convicting Phang and Hoo on this charge. I therefore dismiss
                    Phang’s and Hoo’s appeal against conviction for this
                offence.</p>

                    sales to Neo as commission purportedly as a GSD when they knew that she was not

                            thing dishonestly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There was no dispute that Hoo, as director of
                    Sunshine Empire, was entrusted with dominion over the monies belonging to the
                    company. There was also no dispute that the monies in the eight charges,
                    totalling $947,904.88, were paid out either to Phang (on behalf of Neo) or to
                    Neo between December 2006 and August 2007 by way of cheques signed by Phang. It
                    was further agreed that it was Phang who approached Hoo to make the payments to
                    Neo and that Hoo agreed to the request and authorised the issuance of the eight
                    cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The general tenor of the arguments raised by
                    counsel for Phang and Hoo was that Neo “deserved” to be appointed
                    a GSD by virtue of her immense contributions to Sunshine Empire and the fact
                    that she was not formall<em>y</em> appointed did not cause
                    the payments made to her as a GSD to have been made dishonestly. More
                    specifically, the arguments raised were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neo had contributed greatly to
                        Sunshine Empire, for instance, by giving Sunshine Empire her considerable
                        network of downlines. Furthermore, she did not receive any consideration for
                        her contributions, including giving up her entire money-making and
                        profitable network to Sunshine Empire.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     Neo qualified as a GSD within the Sunshine Empire’s
                        compensation plan and she was regarded and treated by Phang and Hoo to be a
                        GSD. Although Phang and Hoo testified (and conceded) that Neo was not
                        formally appointed as a GSD, they argued that the failure to comply with the
                        company’s formalities did not mean that their acts were carried out
                        with dishonest intention. In any case, the fact that Phang and Hoo thought
                        Neo qualified as a GSD and regarded and treated her as one would mean that
                        they were not dishonest when they caused Sunshine Empire to pay Neo 1% as a
                        GSD; at worst, they had directed Sunshine Empire to make the payments under
                        a mistake of fact, thus entitling them to the defence provided in s 79
                        of the Penal Code which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_79"></a>79.     Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is
                        justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of
                        a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by law, in
                        doing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">[The “illustration” in the section is
                        not reproduced here.]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     As Neo had attained an “even higher” status or rank (of
                        “International Sales Director”) at least 10 years ago, there
                        was no need for any ceremonial appointment of her as a
                    GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was no
                        concealment of facts or of the payments made to Neo, as the payments were
                        transparent in Sunshine Empire’s accounting books and the
                        company’s accounts department was aware that the payments were made
                        for Neo’s contributions to Sunshine Empire.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_e"></a>(e)     If Hoo had made the wrong decision to
                        pay Neo, he would only be liable for breach of s 157 Companies Act
                        (duty of directors to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence) rather
                        than CBT as there was no dishonesty on his part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Based on the above arguments, Phang and Hoo
                    argued that neither the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> nor <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> of the s 409 charges had been proved beyond reasonable
                    doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The DJ was satisfied that there was dishonesty
                    because Phang and Hoo knew that Neo did not meet the qualifications of a GSD but
                    went ahead to direct that payments be made to her as a GSD (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at
                [323]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Having perused the evidence and considered the
                    submissions on appeal, I agree with the DJ’s findings and affirm the
                    convictions for the reasons that the DJ set out in detail in her written
                    decision. They are briefly summarised in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Neo was not in fact appointed
                        as a GSD. On her own evidence, she neither knew that she qualified as a GSD
                        nor that she had been so appointed. Phang and Hoo testified that they had
                        regarded Neo as a GSD but had not announced the appointment to her because
                        there was no need for her to know of the appointment. This was strange
                        against the backdrop that, according to Phang’s testimony, such
                        appointments were often made ceremonially at company events. The inference
                        to be drawn was therefore that Neo was not in fact appointed as a
                        GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        there was no evidence that Neo qualified to be a GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       On Phang’s evidence,
                            the names of managers who met the qualification criteria were generated
                            by the computer system and Neo’s name had not been recognised as
                            having the level of sales or managers required for appointment as a
                            GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Phang and Hoo did not provide any evidence of the purported extensive
                            network of downlines attributable to Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_54-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Further, one of the requirements
                            for qualification as a GSD was that the prospective appointee should
                            have 3 BRMs. At the time when Neo started receiving the 1% payments in
                            2006, the evidence was that one of Neo’s purported BRMs, Liew
                            Chiew Lan (see also [42(b)] above), had not yet been promoted to BRM.
                            Indeed, Liew had earlier told the CAD that she was promoted to BRM only
                            in May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the evidence suggested that the payment to Neo as
                        a GSD was made for extraneous reasons (<em>viz</em>,
                        not because Neo qualified as a GSD under the compensation plan). Phang and
                        Hoo repeatedly testified that Neo deserved the 1% payment in recognition of
                        her contributions to Sunshine Empire. The same reason was apparently given
                        to Jean Yi, who additionally testified that she had never been told that the
                        payment was pursuant to Neo’s appointment as a
                GSD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The 1% payments to Neo amounted to
                    misappropriation of Sunshine Empire’s monies because the payments involved
                    assigning the monies to the wrong person (Neo) and wrong use (as payment as a
                    GSD when Neo was neither qualified nor appointed as GSD). The said payments were
                    also made dishonestly, with the intention of causing wrongful gain to Neo (as
                    she was not entitled to the payments) and wrongful loss to Sunshine
                    Empire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Accordingly, I find that both the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> and <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> elements of the
                    s 409 charges were also made out beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore
                    dismiss Phang’s and Hoo’s appeal against conviction on these
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 477A charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The six charges under ss 477A read with 109 of
                    the Penal Code against Phang and Neo were for their engagement in a conspiracy
                    to disguise six payments (which were the subject-matter of the s 409
                    charges) by causing them to appear to have been paid to Phang when they were
                    meant for Neo.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Before analysing the facts in the s 477A
                    charges, I have a short comment on the form of the charges. I do not think it is
                    necessary to invoke s 109 in a charge under s 477A
                    (“Falsification of accounts”) when abetment is alleged in the
                    circumstances here. This is because s 477A already makes reference to the
                    offence of abetting the falsification of accounts, as follows:</p>

                        subject of the fraud or any particular day on which the offence was
                        committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the addition of s 109 in the s 477A charges does
                    not change the meaning of the charges in any case and no injustice of any sort
                    has been occasioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The DJ found that the falsehood in the six
                    payment vouchers was clearly established because they were stated in the name of
                    Phang when they were meant for Neo (<em>Phang
                        </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [327]). It was
                    undisputed that Neo had instructed Jean Yi of the accounts department to make
                    the payment vouchers in Neo’s name in one month and Phang’s name in
                    the following month. As Neo herself testified, her purported intention in making
                    such an arrangement was to reduce her tax liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Phang and Neo argued that another reason for
                    making the said arrangement was for part of Neo’s income to go to Phang so
                    as to avoid Phang’s embarrassment in having a low income despite being the
                    International President of the Sunshine Enterprise Group of Companies. Indeed,
                    Phang went so far as to assert in a statement to the CAD (recorded under
                    s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code on 19 December 2007) that save
                    for the said arrangement (of falsifying the payment vouchers), he would have to
                    be “declared $0 income”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The DJ was correct in finding that the
                    falsification of the payment vouchers was a dishonest act intended to lessen the
                    amount of tax to be paid, thus amounting to defrauding the tax authority
                        (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em>
                    at [328]). Counsel for Phang and Neo argued on appeal that no evidence was led
                    on how much tax Neo would be able to save by the device of the false payment
                    vouchers. The DJ opined that if the purpose had been achieved, “it would
                    have led to [Neo] paying about less than $21,000 in income tax”
                        (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em>
                    at [346]), although it is not immediately apparent how that figure was derived.
                    In this regard, I note that the rate of income tax is between 3-17% for the
                    first $320,000 of taxable income, with a flat rate of 20% thereafter (see the
                    Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2004 Rev Ed)). It
                    therefore follows that if Phang had a low income or no income whatsoever (as he
                    claimed, “$0 income”), the falsification of the payment vouchers
                    and the consequent transfer of income to him would certainly have had the effect
                    of reducing the overall income tax payable, thereby defrauding the tax
                    authority. In any case, the explanatory note to s 477A makes it clear that
                    it is sufficient to assert a general intent to defraud without naming any
                    particular person intended to be defrauded or specifying any particular sum
                    of money intended to be the subject of the fraud (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I therefore agree with the DJ’s finding
                    that the falsification in this case was done wilfully and with intent to
                    defraud. Accordingly, I also dismiss Phang’s and Neo’s appeals
                    against conviction on the s 477A charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I now deal with the appeals and cross-appeals
                    against the sentences meted out to the appellants upon their conviction on the
                    respective charges. Section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Grounds for reversal of judgment,
                            etc., of District Court or Magistrate’s
                        Court.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">261. No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or
                        Magistrate’s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is
                        shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment,
                        acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the
                        weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly
                        excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 (“<em>Kwong Kok Hing</em>”) at [14], the Court of Appeal held that an appellate court will only
                    interfere with a sentence if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     The trial judge had made the wrong
                        decision as to the proper factual matrix for sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     The trial judge had erred in
                        appreciating the material before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sentence was wrong in principle;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_d"></a>(d)     The sentence was manifestly excessive,
                        or manifestly inadequate. A “manifestly inadequate” sentence
                        is one which is “unjustly lenient… and requires substantial
                        alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the injustice”
                            (<em>Kwong Kok Hing</em> at [15], citing <em>Public
                            Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at
                            [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     With these principles in mind, I turn now to
                    consider whether the sentences ordered by the DJ ought to be varied in type,
                    reduced or enhanced, as the case maybe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 340 charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The punishment prescribed for the s 340
                    charge is provided in s 340(5) of the Companies Act (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), <em>viz</em>, a
                    fine not exceeding $15,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or
                    both. For this charge, the DJ sentenced Phang and Hoo to 4 years 6 months’
                    imprisonment and 3 years 6 months’ imprisonment
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Counsel for Phang and Hoo submitted that the
                    sentences meted out for the s 340 charge were manifestly excessive for the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, no loss was suffered by
                        participants of the Sunshine Empire scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, to date, no complaint or law suit has
                        been filed against Sunshine Empire claiming wrongful loss or
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, all
                        the realisable assets of Sunshine Empire and its associate companies were
                        seized by the CAD and are now in safe custody. The said assets amounted to
                        about $21m. Hence, all available funds have been preserved for distribution
                        to the participants of the Sunshine Empire scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, there was no evidence that
                        either Phang or Hoo profited personally from Sunshine Empire’s
                        business.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the DJ erred by finding that the elaborate set-up (brochures,
                        publicity, <em>etc</em>) of the Sunshine Empire scheme
                        was an aggravating factor; instead, the elaborate set-up indicated that
                        Sunshine Empire was a well thought-out and genuine corporate
                        mechanism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Phang and Hoo also raised arguments specific
                    to their own culpability and the appropriate punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     Phang submitted that he had already
                        suffered a business failure due to the intervention by the CAD and that the
                        destruction of his company – the culmination of many years’
                        effort and ingenuity – was already sufficient
                    punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hoo
                        argued that his culpability was low because he had in fact arranged to meet
                        the CAD on the day of the raid to discuss the Sunshine Empire business
                        model. He further pointed out that Phang was the dominant personality and
                        the mastermind of the Sunshine Empire model, whereas he had always looked to
                        Phang for guidance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On the other hand, the prosecution submitted
                    that the DJ’s sentences were manifestly inadequate and that deterrent
                    sentences would be appropriate in the circumstances here. The prosecution
                    suggested that the sentences imposed should be way past the median and closer to
                    the higher end of the prescribed maximum punishment of 7 years’
                    imprisonment. As an overall view of the aggregate sentences, the prosecution
                    argued that the individual imprisonment terms should be increased and more such
                    terms should be made to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Looking at everything in perspective, I see no
                    reason to vary the nature of the sentences or to lower or enhance the sentences
                    ordered by the DJ. It is clear that Sunshine Empire’s fraudulent business
                    scheme was propagated on a large scale involving more than a hundred million
                    dollars from the trusting public. Despite attempts to clothe the scheme with
                    trappings of legitimacy, such as the e-Mall platform and EM-Call talk time, it
                    was, shorn of its camouflage, a money circulation scheme without genuine sale of
                    goods and services. It was marketed primarily as a compensation plan, with high
                    CRP payouts being the irresistible lure of the scheme. Participants were
                    carefully steered away from realising that the profits they would be earning
                    would not come from investments in various projects but were monies injected by
                    more purchases of packages, whether by new participants or existing ones. There
                    was a palpable sense that the Sunshine Empire scheme had been designed
                    specifically to avert and thwart law enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The failure of Phang’s business clearly
                    cannot be a mitigating factor in the present case because his business is the
                    precise vehicle through which the fraudulent business was conducted. Also,
                    despite Hoo’s arguments that his sentence should be far lower than
                    Phang’s to reflect his lower culpability, it is apparent that Hoo also had
                    a big part to play in the sophisticated set-up. He was in charge of training
                    sessions to ensure that Sunshine Empire was marketed as a sustainable,
                    substantive and legitimate enterprise and was the director having control over
                    the activities of the company. Even if he had looked to Phang for leadership, it
                    is clear that he was not merely a passive onlooker or subservient follower in
                    the fraudulent business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     If Phang and Hoo did not gain financially from
                    the Sunshine Empire scheme over the 15 months or so of its operations, one
                    wonders why they were in the business in the first place. It would indeed be
                    highly surprising considering the millions of dollars piling up in the coffers
                    of Sunshine Empire. The unlawful payments to Neo already added up to almost $1m.
                    We must also not overlook the huge payments and loans made to their affiliated
                    companies (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). Obviously, the
                    appellants were enjoying the richness of the financial oasis that they created
                    in the barren desert of Sunshine Empire by luring more and more unwary
                    participants with the mirage of a highly successful enterprise churning out huge
                    returns on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I also do not think that the sentences are
                    manifestly inadequate in the sense of being “unjustly lenient”
                    (see <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). As matters stand, no
                    participant in the scheme appears to have been adversely affected in any way but
                    that is of course largely due to the pre-emptive and timely intervention by the
                    CAD. As the scheme grows ever larger and the CRP payouts become impossible to
                    service, one can see the potential for massive losses to the later participants
                    as the mirage caused by the Sunshine Empire scheme begins to disappear. On the
                    totality of the evidence here, the sentences imposed by the DJ struck a good
                    balance between deterrence and the legal and moral culpability of Phang and Hoo.
                    The imprisonment terms ordered were already at least half of the maximum
                    permissible under s 340. On the principles propounded in <em>Kwong Kok Hing</em>, I see no cause for enhancing the imprisonment
                    sentences for Phang and Hoo on the s 340 charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 409 charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Section 409 of the Penal Code carries
                    mandatory imprisonment and, at the time of commission of the s 409 offences
                        (<em>ie</em>, before the 2008 Revised Edition of the
                    Penal Code came into force), the maximum imprisonment term was life imprisonment
                    or a term of up to 10 years (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>
                    above). There is also liability to be fined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Phang was sentenced to imprisonment for terms
                    of between 15 and 30 months on each of the eight s 409 charges, with the
                    sentences in DAC 7826/09 (30 months) and DAC 7827/09 (24 months) to run
                    consecutively, making a total of 54 months’ (or 4 years 6 months’)
                    imprisonment for the CBT offences. Phang did not raise any specific grounds of
                    appeal against this sentence, relying instead on the general grounds summarised
                    in <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above and arguing that the totality
                    of the imprisonment terms (<em>viz</em>, 9 years’
                    imprisonment for the s 340 and s 409 charges) was manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Hoo was sentenced to imprisonment for terms of
                    between 9 and 24 months on each of the eight s 409 charges, with the
                    sentences in DAC 7755/09 (24 months) and DAC 7756/09 (18 months) to run
                    consecutively, making a total of 42 months’ (<em>ie</em> 3 years 6 months’) imprisonment. Hoo contended on
                    appeal that the DJ erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the fact that
                    Hoo did not obtain any benefit from the transactions and that Neo had deserved
                    the 1% remuneration by virtue of her vast contributions to Sunshine
                    Empire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The prosecution submitted that the sentences
                    were inadequate, pointing out that the amounts involved in the charges ranged
                    from $51,652.94 to $245,027.05. According to the prosecution, the charges with
                    the lower amounts should carry imprisonment terms in the region of a few years,
                    while those with higher amounts should be in the mid-range of the second tier
                    maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. Therefore, bearing in mind
                    what the sentences for each charge ought to be, the prosecution sought to
                    persuade me that the aggregate imprisonment terms of 4 years 6 months (Phang)
                    and 3 years 6 months (Hoo) in respect of the s 409 charges were manifestly
                    inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is trite that CBT is a serious offence. As
                    explained in Andrew Ashworth, <em>Sentencing and Penal
                        Policy</em> (Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson, 1983) at p 194:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an offence involves a breach of trust, this is generally treated as
                        an aggravating factor. Its powerful influence is shown by the degree to
                        which it outweighs factors which would normally go in mitigation. Indeed,
                        there is a the paradox that some of the strongest factors in mitigation
                        (unblemished career, model citizen, good employment record) are often
                        present in these cases and yet do not tell greatly in the offender’s
                        favour. The reason is that positions of trust are not normally given to
                        individuals unless they have unblemished references, and so the offence may
                        be seen as a betrayal of those very characteristics. The individual who puts
                        himself forward as trustworthy, is trusted by others and then takes
                        advantage of his power for his own personal ends can be said to offend in
                        two ways – not only does he commit the crime charged…, but in
                        addition he breaches the trust placed in him by society and by the victims
                        of the particular offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     It should further be noted that CBT by a
                    director of property within his dominion and control merits a significant
                    sentence since it is a clear abuse of the trust that was reposed in him. This is
                    reflected in the maximum punishment under s 409 (CBT as an agent) being
                    much heavier than that under s 406 (simple CBT which carries a maximum of 3
                    years’ imprisonment, a fine or both).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The present case involved an egregious case of
                    CBT, with a total of $947,904.88 taken from Sunshine Empire over a number of
                    months from December 2006 to August 2007. These were not one-off lapses but were
                    part of sustained activity, reducing the funds available to Sunshine Empire. I
                    do not think that there is any mitigation value in the fact that Neo may have
                    “deserved” some of the misappropriated amounts because of her
                    alleged contributions to Sunshine Empire because the extent of Neo’s
                    contributions was not proved and, more tellingly, because Neo claimed that she
                    was entitled to the 1% payments as she was Phang’s wife (rather than due
                    to any alleged “contributions” on her part).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I agree with the DJ’s finding that
                    Phang’s blameworthiness here was higher than that of Hoo (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [338]).
                    It was Phang who set in motion the CBT offences and the monies were paid to his
                    wife, Neo. While there was no evidence of Hoo obtaining any personal benefit
                    from the s 409 offences, Hoo was a director of Sunshine Empire and the
                    company’s property was clearly within his dominion and control. He abused
                    the trust reposed in him and the fact that he may not have obtained any direct
                    personal benefit from his CBT is therefore not of great mitigation
                value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The DJ ordered a sentence of 30 months (Phang)
                    and 24 months (Hoo) for the most serious act of CBT involving $245,027.05. She
                    also ordered the imprisonment terms for two of the most serious charges (for
                    Phang and Hoo respectively) to run consecutively. In my view, the aggregate
                    imprisonment terms of 4 year 6 months (Phang) and 3 years 6 months (Hoo) were
                    neither manifestly excessive nor manifestly inadequate. They were a good measure
                    of the respective culpability of the two men, considering the period over which
                    the CBT offences took place, the amount involved and the fact that the offences
                    would in all likelihood have continued but for the CAD raid. There is therefore
                    no need to vary the sentences here downwards or upwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 477A charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The prescribed punishment under s 477A of
                    the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or fine or both
                    (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above). The DJ fined Phang and Neo
                    $10,000 on each of the 6 charges, totalling $60,000 for each of
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Phang did not raise any specific grounds of
                    appeal against this sentence, relying instead on the general grounds summarised
                    in <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above. As mentioned earlier, Neo did
                    not appeal against the $60,000 fine which she has paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The prosecution appealed against the sentences
                    passed on Phang and Neo, claiming that the DJ erred in (a) placing insufficient
                    weight on aggravating factors (<em>ie</em> that Phang and
                    Neo had conspired to falsify the payment vouchers), (b) insufficiently
                    considering the principle of deterrence, and (c) wrongly holding that the
                    consequences flowing from Neo’s action (<em>ie</em>
                    to conceal the s 409 offences) were irrelevant in sentencing. The
                    prosecution suggested that an aggregate imprisonment term of 6 months would be
                    appropriate for Neo while the overall sentence for Phang (in respect of all the
                    offences under the Companies Act and the Penal Code) should be enhanced subject
                    to the then maximum of 14 years’ imprisonment which the district court
                    could impose at any one trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As pointed out by the DJ (<em>Phang </em><em>Wah (DC)</em> at [346]), Phang
                    and Neo did not attempt to conceal the purpose of falsifying the vouchers from
                    the staff in Sunshine Empire’s accounting department. Further, the
                    deception was not intended to avoid declaring the whole amount of income or to
                    declare a lower fictitious amount; all Neo had done was to try to lessen the
                    amount she had to pay by declaring it under Phang’s name. However, there
                    would be some loss to the revenue and the falsification of payment vouchers,
                    like the CBT offences, would in all probability have continued if the CAD had
                    not intervened to investigate the illusion of the Sunshine Empire scheme. In the
                    circumstances, I find that the fines imposed by the DJ were neither wrong in
                    principle nor manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Counsel for Phang and Neo argued that 4 out of
                    the 6 s 477A charges were “not separate, stand-alone or independent
                    transactions” but were “subordinate to and even steps preparatory
                    of the s 409 charges” and that once the appellants were punished for
                    the s 409 offences, it was unnecessary to impose any separate and
                    substantial punishment for the s 477A offences because there were no
                    separate or distinct losses. However, it cannot be denied that falsification of
                    accounts need not always go hand-in-hand with CBT. They are distinct offences.
                    Here, one could say that the CBT charges relate to the company’s loss
                    while the s 477A charges relate to the tax authority’s loss. It was
                    therefore correct that a separate set of punishments be imposed for the
                    s 477A charges and that Phang should pay the fines in addition to the
                    sentences for the s 409 charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In cases where multiple charges are involved,
                    it is the number of consecutive imprisonment terms that is of ultimate concern
                    to all involved. The DJ has given appropriate sentences for each category of
                    offences for the appellants. The aggregate sentences for the appellants also
                    reflected their culpability and should serve as sufficient deterrence against
                    such offences. Accordingly, I dismiss all the appeals brought by the appellants
                    and by the prosecution.</p>
