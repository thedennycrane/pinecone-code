Also, Mr Poh benefitted at the expense of the Defendant. Details of all of Mr Poh’s personal expenses paid by the Defendant, and the advances which were given by the Defendant, were set out. Ms Lim then counter-proposed to Mr Poh to transfer all of his shares in the Defendant to Ms Lim for no consideration, and for him to repay a sum of $89,328 to the Defendant. This sum was the amount of a loan taken from DBS Bank for the HDB flat (“the DBS loan”), which the Defendant had allegedly helped to repay. This is described further at [33(a)] below.

</div> The romantic relationship broke down in 2013, and Ms Lim did not shut out Mr Poh because of this reason. Instead, it was Mr Poh who became unhappy about Ms Lim’s actions, and refused to negotiate with Ms Lim and the Defendant in good faith to resolve their differences. Instead, he chose to file this winding up application, so as to exit at will. Based on the facts and circumstances, the “just and equitable” ground was not made out. Similarly, the ground within s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) was not established.

In response to my query, Mr Poh’s counsel replied that he had to check. It was the Defendant’s counsel who pointed to articles 30 to 34 of the Defendant’s articles of association (“the Articles”), which provided for such an exit mechanism. In light of this, I invited the parties to provide further submissions on the effect of the exit mechanism, and also pointed parties to the fact that on 13 November 2017, the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Ho</span><span class="font-italic">ldings Pte Ltd and other matters </span>[2017] SGHC 84, which examined the issue of a buyout mechanism in the context of such an application<span class="font-italic">.</span>

</div>
</div><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The parties filed further submissions on 20 November 2017. In the further written submissions for Mr Poh, it was submitted that by way of the letters exchanged with Ms Lim’s lawyer, he had complied with the exit mechanism in substance, although not in form. The Defendant submitted otherwise, contending that the exit mechanism was not invoked by Mr Poh at all. This was a further reason, according to the Defendant’s counsel, to dismiss the winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 To summarise, I did not find that the grounds within s 254(1)<span class="font-italic">(f) </span>and (<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act had been established. Even if I were to be inclined to accept Mr Poh’s case that there was a management deadlock, or a breakdown of mutual trust and confidence, it was largely brought about by his actions. It appeared that the Defendant and Ms Lim had potential claims against Mr Poh. Further, Mr Poh had not made any genuine efforts to negotiate with Ms Lim on a buy-out, or to invoke the exit mechanism so as to leave the company. Instead, he proceeded with the winding up application to exit at will. Based on all the facts and circumstances, I did not find that the “just and equitable” ground was made out, or that Ms Lim acted in her own interests, or in any manner unfair to Mr Poh. More importantly, I also formed the view that the winding up application was a complete abuse of process by Mr Poh. It was brought for improper motives and for collateral purposes. There was no reason for Mr Poh to rush to resort to this drastic and harsh measure to wind up a going concern, barely a month after the disputes were raised by Ms Lim. This led me to dismiss the winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I now set out my analysis, beginning with the law. In this regard, I should add that on 26 February 2018, the Court of Appeal released its grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Perennial (Capitol) Pte Ltd and another v Capitol Investment Holdings Pte Ltd and other appeals</span> [2018] SGCA 11 (“<span class="font-italic">Perennial</span>”) and I rely on <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>as it encapsulates the applicable legal principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Concerning the “just and equitable” jurisdiction under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act, it is well established that the “notion of unfairness” is its foundation: <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [40]. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Evenstar </span>at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unfairness can arise in different situations and from different kinds of conduct in different circumstances. Cases involving management deadlock or loss of mutual trust and confidence where the “just and equitable” jurisdiction … has been successfully invoked can be re-characterised as cases of unfairness … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 While it is a wide jurisdiction, it is a jurisdiction that has to be exercised with caution, “particularly where the making of such an order would have the effect of releasing the applicant from any obligation to comply with the scheme of things provided under the memorandum and articles of association”: <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [40]. In fact, any unfairness lies in the inability to exit a company. Even in situations of impasse “where the shareholder is being marginalised or shut out from management, or where there is a loss of trust and confidence, it is the notion of being locked into such a situation that is unfair”: <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [51]. Therefore, the question is whether there is an option for the applicant to exit from its interests in the company at fair value. Indeed, the presence of a buyout mechanism in the company’s constitution would be a vital consideration. An applicant who had not even attempted to invoke the buyout mechanism would be unlikely to establish the “unfairness” necessary to invoke the court’s just and equitable jurisdiction to wind up a company: <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [56], referring to <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping</span> at [75], [76] and [107]. That said, there could be situations in which unfairness would be established notwithstanding the presence of a buyout mechanism. This included the situation where there is “a defect in the valuation mechanism – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was arbitrary or artificial”: <span class="font-italic">Perennial</span> at [56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With that, I go to the alternative ground within s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Companies Act. As observed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re HL </span><span class="font-italic">Sensecurity Pte Ltd (formerly known as HL Integral Systems Pte Ltd </span>[2006] SGHC 135 at [28], it is a rarely used provision, and has two constituent parts. The first part applies when the directors are shown to have preferred their own interest to the interests of one, or more or perhaps some significant section of the members of the company so that the action of the directors may be open to challenge. As for the second part, it relates to the directors acting in any other manner “which appears to be unfair or unjust to other members”.  It is said that the words “unfair and unjust” refers to the commercial morality or integrity which the law sets out to uphold or sustain, having regard to the circumstances of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Moving on, it is also well established that a winding up application can be struck out or dismissed on the basis “that it is an abuse of process if it is brought to harass the company or for a collateral purpose”: <span class="font-italic">Ti</span><span class="font-italic">ng Shwu Ping </span>at [47], see also <span class="font-italic">Evenstar </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[39]. In this regard, “the investigation of whether there is an abuse is often inextricably tied up with an investigation of the grounds presented and whether the applicant has acted reasonably or has been impelled by improper motives”: <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [38] and <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping</span> at [77]. Therefore, especially when hearing an application based on the “just and equitable” ground, matters are often determined in the round. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 For completeness, I should add that the test for ordering a winding up under ss 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act has to be met before the remedy under s 254(2A) might be granted for the court to order a buy-out of the applicant’s shares: see<span class="font-italic"> Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping </span>at [40] and [46].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grounds for winding up   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Essentially, Mr Poh’s case was that by Ms Lim’s actions as set out at [8] to [11] above, she had effectively shut him out from the affairs of the company, which was formed as a quasi-partnership. There was a management deadlock, and a loss of mutual trust and confidence. As such, it was argued that the Defendant should be wound up. Mr Poh’s counsel, however, did not consider the <span class="font-italic">reasons</span> leading to the situation to be material. Thus, on the dispute over the use of funds, should the Defendant have any valid claims against Mr Poh, these can be dealt with by the liquidator. As for the dispute over the acquisition of shares, should Ms Lim have any valid claim against Mr Poh, again, it was open to Ms Lim to commence legal proceedings against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Even if I were to accept Mr Poh’s case that he had been shut out from the affairs of the company, and that there was a loss of mutual trust and confidence, it was important to examine <span class="font-italic">all </span>the relevant factors, including the reasons for the problems between the parties, in order to ascertain whether objectively, there was unfairness to him arising from the situation at the time. With that, I turn to deal with the areas of dispute, starting with the dispute over the acquisition of shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 According to Ms Lim, she expected Mr Poh to pay for his shares, and had asked him for payment.

</div> Mr Poh’s position was that the 20,000 shares were given to him as a gift, in view of his extensive contributions to reviving the sole proprietorship from early 2010 to 2013, and later towards the Defendant. He had never been asked to pay for any of the shares. He denied that he deceived Ms Lim into transferring the 5,000 shares to him for the consideration of $1, and instead alleged that it was Ms Lim’s idea to do so. At that time, they were still in a romantic relationship.

While it was not for me to determine the dispute, two uncontested points emerged. First, I noted that conceivably, Ms Lim had a potential claim against Mr Poh for payment for the shares.

These were relevant factors for my consideration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Moving on to the dispute over the use of funds, I set out some details. From as early as 2014 when Mr Poh acquired the HDB flat, the Defendant had been paying for certain expenses of the HDB flat. These included the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the servicing of the monthly instalments of the DBS loan, amounting to $89,328.00 (including interest amounting to $9,328.00 and a processing fee of $500).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Of the two versions concerning Ms Lim’s knowledge of the financial affairs of the Defendant, I was more convinced by Ms Lim’s position that prior to June 2017, she was not fully aware of the Defendant’s financial state. In fact, this was consistent with Mr Poh’s admission that he was in charge of the administration and management of the Defendant.

</div>
</div> Meanwhile, it appeared that Ms Lim, who set up the sole proprietorship, was really far more involved in the daily operations of the business. Such was the division of labour between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Turning to the dispute over the use of funds, once again, it was not for me to determine the substantive merits of the various allegations. However, two material points emerged. First, the Defendant might have a potential claim against Mr Poh for some, if not all of the payments. Second, the Defendant paid <span class="font-italic">substantial </span>sums for Mr Poh’s expenses. These payments were in addition to the salary paid by the Defendant to Mr Poh. In contrast, it did not appear that Ms Lim took such sums from the Defendant. These two factors were relevant for my consideration.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Assessed holistically, the factual matrix was that the Defendant took over the business of a sole proprietorship belonging to Ms Lim. Apart from $1, Mr Poh did not pay for his shares in the Defendant. Undoubtedly, Mr Poh contributed towards the sole proprietorship, as well as the Defendant which might have accounted for the shares being allocated to him. However, at all times, he was paid a salary, and the shares are fairly valuable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Then, from 2014, the Defendant paid substantial sums for Mr Poh’s personal benefit, especially towards the HDB flat. Thus, by end June 2017, the Defendant was somewhat in a financial strain. Specifically, as at end June 2017, there was only a sum of $9,534.89 left in the Defendant’s OCBC bank account, and a sum of $381.14 in its DBS bank account. This was in contrast to the total sum of about $41,000 at the end of 31 December 2016 in these accounts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, there was basis for Ms Lim to take the remedial steps to stop the payment for his expenses, as Mr Poh was away. Admittedly, Mr Poh might be aggrieved by the extent of Ms Lim’s measures, which seemed to have shut him out from the Defendant’s affairs. However, those additional measures could not be said to be detrimental to the Defendant, and the Defendant continued its operations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Even if there was a deadlock in the management, and or a breakdown of mutual trust and confidence between the shareholders, it seemed to me that the situation was substantially caused by Mr Poh’s actions. Arising from the disputes over Mr Poh’s actions, Ms Lim and the Defendant may well have legitimate claims against him, which remain unresolved. Meanwhile, the company is still a going concern, and Ms Lim continued to run the company on a daily basis. Given these facts and circumstances, I did not see how it could be argued that Ms Lim, as a director, had acted in her own interests, or in a manner unfair to Mr Poh. As for the “just and equitable” ground, I also did not see how it could be said to be made out, or that it could be relied on by Mr Poh.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 My view was fortified by the fact that I found that Mr Poh was not trapped in the impasse. By the correspondence exchanged between the lawyers, it seemed to me that parties understood that the valuation and the disposal of Mr Poh’s shares stood in the way of them parting ways. Although Ms Lim appeared to be pressing for a transfer of his shares to her with no consideration, this was on the basis of resolving the claims she felt she had against him. Therefore, as Ms Lim’s counsel put it, there were matters to be negotiated between the parties. However, Mr Poh did not address the disputes, and very quickly put to a close the negotiation process by lodging proceedings. I shall return to the exchange between the lawyers from [49] below. For now, I add that as the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Summit Co (S) Pte Ltd v Pacific Biosciences Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR (R) 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Summit</span>”) at [27]–[35], where parties cannot reach an agreement as to the terms on which they are to sever their relationship, there is no basis to wind up the company under the “just and equitable” ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, Mr Poh had not <span class="font-italic">genuinely</span> sought to rely on the exit mechanism contained within the Articles. Again, any unfairness arising from the situation Mr Poh found himself in could also have been negated by the exit mechanism. At this point, I pause to reproduce the relevant articles of the Articles

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Defendant’s further submissions at [20]. See also Minute Sheet of hearing on 15 November 2017, 2.30pm.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was conceded by Mr Poh’s counsel at the hearing on 15 November 2017. Caught in the situation, Mr Poh’s counsel submitted that based on the exchange of the lawyers’ letters, Mr Poh had complied with the exit mechanism, in substance, if not in form. He argued that notice had been given to the Defendant, by way of the lawyer’s letters dated 10 and 21 August 2017. Also, Mr Poh had suggested that a valuation be carried out by an accountant or an independent auditor, and that the share transfer price to be carried out based on this: see [12] above. It is pertinent to note that Mr Poh’s counsel did not argue that the exit mechanism was defective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I observed that the letters of 10 and 21 August 2017 were sent to Ms Lim’s lawyers, and addressed to Ms Lim. These were not notices to the Defendant. In any event, on 10 August 2017, Mr Poh gave Ms Lim a mere seven days to reply to his proposal, and then in the 21 August 2017 letter, he gave her four more days to consider the matter. On the other hand, the exit mechanism provided that the Defendant is entitled to up to three months to act on such a notice of intention to sell. While Mr Poh’s counsel argued that the timeframe of three months was unnecessary because Ms Lim was the only other member of the Defendant, and that notice to Ms Lim sufficed as notice to the Defendant, it remained the case that Ms Lim was deprived of having sufficient time to consider the matter, and that no formal notice was given to the Defendant, as a separate entity from Ms Lim. In fact, I reiterate my view that Mr Poh had hastily brought the negotiations process to a close. In my view, Mr Poh had not sought to go through the process provided for under the Articles, and I agreed with Ms Lim’s counsel that this was a further basis to find that the “just and equitable” ground was simply not made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of process  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 More importantly, based on the above, and my further discussion below, I found that the winding up application was, in fact, brought with an ulterior motive or for collateral purposes, namely, to pressure Ms Lim to purchase Mr Poh’s shares for $150,000, without having to provide any answers to the various allegations raised by Ms Lim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In his first letter to Ms Lim on 10 August 2017 after the meeting on 1 August 2017, Mr Poh merely cited “irreconcilable differences” between the parties. He did not deal specifically with any of the disputes. Instead, he demanded that Ms Lim buy out his shares in the Defendant for a hefty sum of $150,000, agree to a voluntary winding up, or he would “<span class="font-italic">apply to court for a winding up</span>”.  In her lawyer’s letter of 17 August 2017, Ms Lim set out all her specific concerns, itemising the expenses for Mr Poh’s benefit. She made a proposal for him to leave the company, and to repay a sum of money for the DBS loan only. In the response of 21 August 2017, Mr Poh denied that the Defendant made the payments of his expenses (a position from which he retracted subsequently). Again, his demand for a buy out of his shares in the Defendant (with <span class="font-italic">four </span>days for Ms Lim to decide) was coupled with the threat to “<span class="font-italic">commence legal action</span>”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 From Mr Poh’s conduct, I found that Mr Poh was focused on pressuring Ms Poh to buy his shares for valuable consideration. Mr Poh was not interested in resolving the root causes of the dispute with Ms Lim at all. Barely a month after Ms Lim raised her concerns, on 28 August 2017, Mr Poh filed the winding up application. In fact, I noted that Mr Poh’s supporting affidavit for the winding up application was affirmed on 23 August 2017. This meant that even <span class="font-italic">before </span>receiving Ms Lim’s reply on 25 August 2017 (which was the stipulated deadline for Ms Lim’s reply), Mr Poh had already made preparations to file his winding up application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 After the winding up application was filed, and Ms Lim had filed her first affidavit on behalf of the Defendant providing evidence of all the excessive financial personal benefit Mr Poh enjoyed at the Defendant’s expense, Mr Poh merely replied that such expenses had been approved by Ms Lim. He did not attempt to account for them and insisted on his wish to wind up the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As Ms Lim’s counsel pointed out, even if there were to be a share buyout, it was reasonable for Ms Lim to wish to understand Mr Poh’s position on the expenses and advances so that these can be taken into consideration in deciding on a fair price to Mr Poh. Indeed, some time would be required to establish a fair price, if any. However, Mr Poh had no interest to discuss the disputes, or to negotiate in good faith. I noted that even at the hearing, Mr Poh’s counsel submitted that should the Defendant or Ms Lim have any valid claims against Mr Poh, they should take out separate legal proceedings. Again, this reflected Mr Poh’s unreasonableness in insisting on proceeding with the winding up proceedings, regardless of the underlying disputes or the impact on the company. It was also telling that in the winding up application, Mr Poh did not pray for the relief under s 254(2A) of the Companies Act for the court to order a buy-out of his shares. Instead, this was only brought up in the course of the submissions by Mr Poh’s counsel.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mr Poh’s application to wind up the Defendant became more suspect when it was clear that the Defendant is a going concern, and appears to be a viable business. As the High Court stated in <span class="font-italic">Summit </span>at [7], where a company is a going concern, there is no reason to believe that an aggrieved minority shareholder would want to wind up the company if his real relief can be satisfied in other ways. As such, the court should look at the motive for doing so. I found that the consideration applied with even more force where Mr Poh was a 50% shareholder.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To sum up, in filing the winding up application, I found that Mr Poh intended to exert pressure on Ms Lim to buy him out, at a price which would ignore any disputes between the parties. Mr Poh intended to profit from the winding up as an equal shareholder, without consideration of the effect on the Defendant. In this regard, I also refer to the discussion above on the grounds of winding up, and rely on them in finding that this has been a complete abuse of process by Mr Poh.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Further letters by parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Two days after I had dismissed this application, Mr Poh’s counsel wrote to me, arguing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia,</span> that the exit mechanism was defective. In his letter, he did not even refer to s 28B of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). He also included fresh evidence. Unsurprisingly, the Defendant objected to the letter, and disputed that the exit mechanism was defective. Given that Mr Poh’s counsel had failed to properly apply for leave of court to hear further arguments, and did not seek leave to adduce further evidence, I did not consider the contents of the letters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In conclusion, I found that there was no basis to wind up the company under the grounds within ss 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Companies Act, and that there has been an abuse of the process of the court. As the grounds for winding up had not been established, there was no basis for me to order a buy-out of Mr Poh’s shares under s 254(2A) of the Companies Act. I therefore dismissed the winding up application. I ordered costs of $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by Mr Poh to the Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew John Hanam (Andrew LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Ignatius Joseph, Wong Jun Weng Andrew and Chong Xin Yi (Ignatius J &amp; Associates) for the defendant;<br/>Beverly Wee for the Official Receiver.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
