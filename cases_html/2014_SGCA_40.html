<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present appeal arose out of the decision of
                    the High Court judge (“the Judge”) to set aside part of an
                    arbitral award in <em>BLB and another v BLC and others</em>
                    [2013] 4 SLR 1169 (“the Judgment”) on the ground of a breach
                    of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The central question raised in this appeal is a
                    factual one, <em>ie</em>, whether the Judge was correct in
                    finding that the sole arbitrator had not addressed his mind to one of the
                    respondents’ counterclaims (“the Disputed Counterclaim”) and
                    thereby failed to deal with an essential issue in the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We acknowledge that whether an arbitrator has
                    addressed his mind to an issue may not always be clear cut and will invariably
                    depend entirely on the facts. However, in looking at the relevant facts, the
                    court must be extremely careful not to do more than is necessary, bearing in
                    mind the principle of minimal curial intervention as well as the salutary
                    reminder that the <em>substantive merits</em> of the
                    arbitral proceedings are <em>beyond</em> the remit of the
                    court (see also below at [51]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In this regard, it is important not to
                    underestimate the ingenuity of counsel who seek to launch backdoor appeals or,
                    worse still, completely reinvent their client’s cases with the benefit of
                    hindsight in the guise of a challenge based on an alleged breach of natural
                    justice. The latter is a simple – yet profoundly important – point
                    in so far as the present appeal is concerned. The courts must be wary of a party
                    who accuses an arbitrator of failing to consider and deal with an issue that was
                    never before him in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Judgment also raised some interesting
                    questions in relation to the operation of Art 33(3) of the UNCITRAL Model
                    Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) and
                    the power of remission under Art 34(4) which we will consider briefly after
                    we have dealt with the main question at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The background has been set out comprehensively
                    in the Judgment (at [4]–[30]). For the purposes of this appeal, it is only
                    necessary to highlight the following facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first appellant owns a group of companies
                    which produces and sells piping components. The second and third appellants
                    belong to this particular group of companies. The second respondent is a company
                    involved in the automotive industry in Malaysia. The first respondent was a
                    wholly owned subsidiary of the second respondent prior to the joint venture
                    between the parties. For the purposes of this appeal, we shall refer to all the
                    appellants and respondents as the “Appellants” and
                    “Respondents” respectively, unless the context requires
                    otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The joint venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Following negotiations between the parties in
                    2002, the Appellants agreed with the second respondent to form a commercial
                    joint venture. The plan was for the Appellants to transfer their business
                    operations in Malaysia including an industrial plant which manufactured pipe
                    components (which we shall refer to as “goods”) to the first
                    respondent in exchange for a minority stake in the first respondent. In this
                    way, the first respondent was to become the parties’ joint venture vehicle
                    and the industrial plant would effectively be operated by the second respondent
                    who would continue to retain a majority stake in the first respondent. It was
                    also agreed that the Appellants would continue to purchase goods from the joint
                    venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The commercial deal was drawn up in a Heads of
                    Agreement (“HOA”) but was further documented in, <em>inter alia</em>, the following agreements entered into
                    between 2003 and 2005: (i) the Asset Sale Agreement (“the
                    ASA”); (ii) the Shareholders Agreement (“the SA”);
                    (iii) the Business Operations Agreement (“the BOA”) and
                    (iv) the Licence Agreement (“the LA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The following terms of these agreements are of
                    particular relevance in the context of the present appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Under cl 5.2.1 of the ASA, the
                        Appellants were to transfer various assets to the
                    Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under
                        cl 5.7 of the BOA, the Respondents were to issue an invoice for any
                        goods sold and delivered to the Appellants who would then be under a
                        contractual obligation to pay these invoices in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Under cl 4.1 of the LA, the
                        Appellants granted the first respondent a licence to use the
                        Appellants’ trademark on the goods it manufactured and the first
                        respondent undertook to manufacture these goods in accordance with the
                        Appellants’ quality standards. It is common ground that goods which
                        did not meet these quality standards were deemed to be defective
                        goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The joint venture commenced on June 2005 after
                    the Respondents took over operations of the plant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Unfortunately, problems started to surface
                    almost immediately after the joint venture agreements were concluded. Between
                    July and December 2005, the Respondents were unable to fulfil several of the
                    Appellants’ orders for the joint venture’s goods, both in terms of
                    the stipulated deadlines and the quality of these goods. The Appellants
                    subsequently notified the Respondents of alleged breaches of the BOA and LA by
                    virtue of these delays and the defects in the goods received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Between 7 November 2005 and
                    17 January 2007, the Appellants issued ten “debit notes”
                    pursuant to which the Appellants sought rectification costs against the
                    Respondents for goods which they had already paid for delivered but which turned
                    out to be defective. Notwithstanding the issue of these debit notes, the
                    Appellants continued to order more goods from the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The relationship continued to sour and on or
                    about 13 February 2007, the Respondents wrote to the Appellants to demand
                    the sum of RM4,653,604.78 for goods sold and delivered. On 14 February
                    2007, the Appellants denied that this amount was owed. On 28 February 2007,
                    the Respondents wrote to the Appellants, reiterating their demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Separately, on or about 13 February 2007,
                    the Respondents wrote to the Appellants to demand the transfer to them of bank
                    balances amounting to RM22,185.88. On or about 14 February 2007, the
                    Appellants denied their obligation to transfer this sum. On or about
                    15 March 2007, the Respondents reiterated their demand for the transfer of
                    the above sum but this time stated that the Appellants were obliged to do so
                    under the terms of the ASA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 30 May 2007, the Appellants commenced
                    arbitration proceedings against the Respondents in respect of disputes arising
                    from the BOA and the LA (the parties referred to this arbitration as “the
                    BOA Arbitration”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 25 June 2007, the Appellants commenced
                    separate arbitration proceedings against the Respondents in respect of disputes
                    arising from the SA (the parties referred to this arbitration as “the SA
                    Arbitration”). The parties agreed that both arbitrations would be heard
                    by the same arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the BOA Arbitration, the Appellants claimed
                    that the Respondents had breached several terms of the BOA and the LA. Amongst
                    other things, the Appellants claimed that the Respondents had breached
                    cl 4.1 of the LA by manufacturing goods which were not in accordance with
                    the applicable quality standards (thereby rendering them defective). Arising
                    from these defects, the Appellants claimed rectification costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In response, the Respondents claimed in the
                    BOA Arbitration, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Appellants
                    had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     induced the Respondents to enter the
                        joint venture through misrepresentations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     acted in a manner inconsistent with the aim and
                        object of the joint venture; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     induced a breach of the BOA and the LA and/or caused loss
                        and damage to the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Arising from these allegations, the
                    Respondents counterclaimed for various amounts, including the sum of
                    RM5,838,956.00. The Disputed Counterclaim relates to this RM5,838,956.00, which
                    purportedly consisted of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     the RM22,185.88 of bank balances
                        (see above at [15]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     the RM4,653,604.78 for goods delivered up till 13 February 2007 (see
                        above at [14]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     receivables for additional goods delivered after 13 February
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the end of the evidential phase of the
                    hearing, the arbitrator directed that the parties submit an agreed framework of
                    issues to be tried (“list of issues”), failing which, each party
                    was to submit its own list of issues. The parties were unable to agree a common
                    list of issues and eventually opted for the separate lists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The arbitrator found in favour of the
                    Appellants in respect of some of their claims in the BOA Arbitration but
                    dismissed all of their claims in the SA Arbitration and all of the
                    Respondents’ counterclaims in both the BOA Arbitration and the SA
                    Arbitration. For our purposes, we will only focus on the arbitrator’s
                    decision relating to the BOA Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The arbitrator commenced the award by
                    summarising the gist of the dispute. At para 1.3.3(l) of the award, he
                    noted that the Respondents were alleging, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the Appellants had failed to pay the Respondents for
                    the goods it had purchased. He also noted at para 1.5.1(f) of the award
                    that the Respondents’ financial controller (who had given evidence
                    concerning the Disputed Counterclaim) was presented by the Respondents as a
                    factual witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Next, the arbitrator proceeded at
                    para 1.8.1 of award to identify the issues which arose as a result of the
                    Appellants’ claim in the BOA Arbitration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Against that factual and contractual backdrop, [the Appellants <em>submit</em>], <em>and I accept as a
                            convenient framework</em>, that the issues which arise from [the
                        Appellants’] claims in the BOA Arbitration are as set out in the
                        following paragraphs…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Issue 1: whether [the first<sup></sup>respondent] breached Clause 5.4.1 of the BOA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Issue 2: whether [the first respondent] breached Clause 5.4.3 of
                        the BOA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Issue 3: if the Tribunal finds in favour of the [Appellants] on Issue
                        1 and Issue 2, whether [the first respondent’s] breach of
                        clause 5.4.3 contributed to its breach of clause 5.4.1 of the BOA;
                        and if so, whether [the first appellant are] entitled to claim consequential
                        losses…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Issue 4: whether [the first respondent] breached clause 4.1 of
                        the LA and if so, whether [the first appellant is] entitled to recover costs
                        of US$43,108.69 and €424,168.33 which [the first appellant] incurred to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As can be seen from [24]–[25] above, the
                    arbitrator did not expressly identify two issues relating to the Disputed
                    Counterclaim which featured in paras 15 and 15.1 of the Respondents’
                    list of issues (but which did not feature in the Appellants’ list of
                    issues) as issues to be decided in the BOA Arbitration. Paras 15 and 15.1
                    of the Respondents’ list of issues read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Whether [the
                            Appellants are] indebted to [the first respondent] for goods sold and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The arbitrator did, however, set out the
                    Disputed Counterclaim as one of the remedies sought by the Respondents as
                    Issue #16(iii). We note, parenthetically, that it was clear from the manner
                    in which the arbitrator had framed Issue #16 that he was of the view that
                    the Respondents would <em>not</em> be entitled to any of
                    the amounts that were the subject of counterclaims in the BOA Arbitration
                    (including the Disputed Counterclaim) if the Appellants succeeded on
                    Issue #1 to Issue #4 <em>and</em> the Respondents
                    failed in its counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having identified the issues which he had to
                    determine, the arbitrator proceeded to deal with the substantive merits of the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The arbitrator first found for the Appellants
                    in so far as Issue #1 and Issue #2 were concerned. In other words, he
                    was satisfied that the Respondents had breached cll 5.4.1 and 5.4.3 of the
                    BOA. The arbitrator then considered whether the Respondents had breached
                    cl 4.1 of the LA in producing goods which were defective (he dealt with
                    this as Issue #3 even though it was listed in his list of issues as

                    paras 5.3 to 5.6 of the award, the arbitrator proceeded to consider the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 19 October 2012, the Respondents
                    applied to set aside the <em>entire</em> award on three

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the arbitrator failed to deal
                        with the Disputed Counterclaim because he had extensively adopted the
                        Appellants’ list of issues over the Respondents’ list, thus
                        breaching the rules of natural justice contrary to s 24(<em>b</em>) of the International Arbitration Act
                        (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the arbitrator had failed to
                        exercise the authority conferred on him to determine the Disputed
                        Counterclaim, contrary to Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the arbitrator had made gross or egregious
                        errors in the award and this conflicted with public policy and was contrary
                        to Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model
                        Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     New counsel were instructed by both sides for
                    the purposes of the setting aside application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Judge agreed with the Respondents that the
                    arbitrator had failed to deal with the Disputed Counterclaim because it was
                    likely that he had extensively adopted the Appellants’ list of issues and
                    that there therefore had been a denial of natural justice. We set out at
                    [34]–[41] below a summary of the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Judge first found that it was
                    “common ground” that the defective goods which were the subject of
                    the Appellants’ claim under cl 4.1 of the LA (which the Judge
                    referred to as “Group A Goods”) were different from the goods
                    that were the subject of the Disputed Counterclaim (which the Judge referred to
                    as “Group B Goods”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Group A Goods were received
                        and paid for by the Appellants. They were the subject of ten debit notes
                        issued by the Appellants who were seeking to claim rectification costs for
                        these goods on the basis that they were defective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Group B Goods, on the other
                        hand, were received but were not paid for by the Respondents. Further, since
                        they were not the subject of any debit notes and any claim for rectification
                        works, there were no allegations that the Group B Goods were
                        defective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>(see the Judgment at [16], [38] and
                    [58]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Next, the Judge observed that the arbitrator
                    did not expressly find that the Respondents were not entitled to the Disputed
                    Counterclaim because the defects in the goods resulted in an abatement in their
                    price. In fact, no mention at all was made by the arbitrator of any defects in
                    relation to the Group B Goods (see the Judgment at [63]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     According to the Judge, the basis of the
                    arbitrator’s decision was that the Respondents had breached their
                    obligations under cll 5.4.1 and 5.4.3 of the BOA and cl 4.1 of the LA.
                    The Appellants were accordingly entitled to recover for loss of profits and to
                    recover rectification costs in respect of defective goods supplied by the
                    Respondents. The arbitrator also held that the Respondents had failed to either
                    establish that the Appellants had breached their obligations under the joint
                    venture agreements (<em>ie</em>, Issue #13), or that
                    the Appellants had acted in a manner to frustrate the joint venture (<em>ie</em>, Issue #14). Having ruled against the
                    Respondents on liability in respect of Issue #13 and Issue #14, the
                    arbitrator considered that the remedies and reliefs sought in Issue #16
                    (including the sum that constituted the Disputed Counterclaim) did not arise for
                    determination (see the Judgment at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge then concluded that since the
                    question of liability for payment of the Group B Goods (<em>ie</em>, the Disputed Counterclaim) was unrelated to Issue #13
                    and Issue #14 as framed by the arbitrator, there was no logical corollary
                    between the arbitrator’s findings and the Disputed Counterclaim. It
                    therefore could not be inferred from the face of the award that the arbitrator
                    had actually (albeit implicitly) considered and dismissed the Disputed
                    Counterclaim (see the Judgment at [85]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the Judge’s view, this was a case
                    where it had slipped the arbitrator’s notice that the Disputed
                    Counterclaim was a claim that had to be dealt with independently of his findings
                    on the other issues. The Judge then surmised that it was highly likely that this
                    slip had occurred “because the [arbitrator] extensively adopted [the
                    Appellants’] list of issues to be determined …” (see the
                    Judgment at [63], [64] and [85]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     By failing to consider the Disputed
                    Counterclaim, the arbitrator failed to apply his mind to the critical issues and
                    arguments in the dispute (see the Judgment at [88]). There was therefore a
                    breach of natural justice under s 24(<em>b</em>) of
                    the IAA and the Respondents had suffered prejudice as a result (see the Judgment
                    at [93]). The Judge also went on to find that, in the circumstances, recourse
                    was also available under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii)
                    since the arbitrator failed to exercise the authority granted to him by the
                    parties and the doctrine of <em>intra petitia</em>
                    “clearly applied” (see the Judgment at [99]). The Judge found it
                    unnecessary to deal with the challenge under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law but expressed doubts that this ground
                    was applicable (see the Judgment at [100]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the circumstances, the Judge set aside the
                    arbitrator’s finding in Issue #16 that related to the Disputed
                    Counterclaim and “considered it appropriate to remit the Dispute
                    Counterclaim… and costs thereof to a new tribunal (which is to be
                    constituted) for determination” (see Judgment at [101] and
                [102]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Judge then went on to make the following
                    observation at [103] of the Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I note, parenthetically, that this would have been the type of case that
                        Art 33(3) of the Model Law would have been intended to provide redress
                        for. Art 33(3) permits parties to request (within a specified time
                        period) the arbitral tribunal to make an additional award as to claims
                        presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award. It is to
                        be hoped that parties in future cases of a similar nature would first
                        attempt to avail themselves of any available opportunities to seek redress
                        from the tribunal itself, before turning to the courts (assuming of course
                        that this is possible in the circumstances).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Counsel for the Appellants, Mr Chenthil
                    Kumarasingam (“Mr Kumarasingam”), conceded that the
                    ten debit notes issued by the Appellants only related to the goods
                    identified by the Judge as the “Group A Goods”. However, he
                    contended that this was legally irrelevant in the Respondents’ setting
                    aside application since the parties themselves had not distinguished between the
                    two types of goods (<em>ie</em>, Group A Goods and
                    Group B Goods) in the arbitration in so far as allegations of defectiveness
                    were concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In addition, Mr Kumarasingam pointed out
                    that it was in fact the Respondents’
                    <em>own</em> case in the arbitration that the issue of
                    payment for the goods (in general and not only in relation to goods which the
                    parties now categorise as Group B Goods) was directly linked to the issue
                    of who was responsible for the defects in the goods produced by the Respondents.
                    It therefore did not lie in the Respondents’ mouth to now argue that the
                    arbitrator had not considered the Disputed Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In any event, Mr Kumarasingam submitted
                    that the arbitrator <em>did</em> in fact consider the
                    Disputed Counterclaim and that there was no breach of natural justice. According
                    to him, this was, at the very worst, a case of an error of fact and/or law on
                    the part of the arbitrator for which no recourse to the courts was
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Counsel for the Respondents, Mr Hri
                    Kumar SC (“Mr Kumar”), submitted that the Judge’s
                    decision should be upheld because according to Mr Kumar, the
                    Appellants’
                    <em>only</em> defence against the Disputed Counterclaim in
                    the arbitration was that they did not accept the quantum payable on the
                    “Group B Goods” which they had left to the arbitrator to
                    determine. Once the quantum was determined, the Appellants merely sought to set
                    off this amount against their other claims in the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Contrary to the position taken by
                    Mr Kumarasingam which we have summarised at [42] and [43] above,
                    Mr Kumar <em>repeatedly</em> submitted that it was
                    neither party’s case in the arbitration that the Appellants should be
                    relieved of their obligations to pay for the Group B Goods if the
                    Respondents were found responsible for the defects in goods. To make good this
                    assertion, Mr Kumar stressed that the debit notes issued by the Appellants
                    only related to the Group A Goods. On that basis, he asserted that the
                    Appellants’ list of issues (which did <em>not</em>
                    contain the issues set out in paras 15 and 15.1 of the Respondents’
                    list of issues (see above at [26])) was wrong and misleading in so far as it
                    suggested that this was the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Whilst Mr Kumar conceded that the term
                    “Group A Goods” and “Group B Goods”
                    <em>did not appear anywhere in</em> (i) the pleadings,
                    (ii) the lists of issues and (iii) written submissions (“the
                    source documents”), he asserted that the distinction between the two
                    groups of goods <em>was clear</em> when the source
                    documents were read in their proper context. This assertion formed an essential
                    plank in the Respondents’ case that the Judge was right to find that there
                    was no logical corollary between the arbitrator’s (i) findings on the
                    various issues and (ii) the conclusion that the Disputed Counterclaim did
                    not arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Accordingly, Mr Kumar argued that the
                    Judge was correct in the circumstances to adopt the Respondents’ case
                    theory that the arbitrator had extensively adopted the Appellants’ list of
                    issues (which, as we have already observed (see above at [26] and [46]), did
                        <em>not</em> contain the issues set out in
                    paras 15 and 15.1 of the Respondents’ list of issues) instead of
                    considering both parties’ lists of issues and that this had led to his
                    failure to deal with the substantive merits of the Disputed
                Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Finally, Mr Kumar urged us to uphold the
                    Judge’s decision because he said that it would otherwise mean that, as a
                    matter of substance, the Appellants would have obtained the Group B Goods
                    free of charge and that would be an extremely unfair result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Before proceeding further, we should point out
                    that the Respondents’ arguments on natural justice and
                        Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law stand
                    and fall together and we therefore do not propose to consider
                        Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) separately. Further,
                    the Respondents (correctly, in our view) did not seek to rely on the public
                    policy ground in Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) to set
                    aside the award in the present appeal and so we need not say any more about this
                    particular issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is now axiomatic that there will be minimal
                    curial intervention in arbitral proceedings. As the Judge acknowledged at [67]
                    of the Judgment, citing our decision in <em>Soh Beng
                        Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Soh Beng
                    Tee</em>”) (at [65(c)]), the principle of minimal curial
                    intervention flows from “the need to encourage finality in the arbitral
                    process as well as the deemed acceptance by the parties to an arbitration of the
                    attendant risks of having only a very limited right of recourse to the
                    courts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     A “very limited right of recourse to
                    the courts” is statutorily available where there has been a denial of
                    natural justice – in the context of this appeal, when an arbitrator does
                    not consider one party’s case and thereby fails to deal with an essential
                    issue in the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In considering whether an arbitrator has
                    addressed his mind to an issue, however, the court must be wary of its natural
                    inclination to be drawn to the various arguments in relation to the substantive
                    merits of the underlying dispute between the parties. In the context of a
                    setting aside application, it is crucial for the courts to recognise that these
                    substantive merits are <em>beyond</em> its remit
                    notwithstanding its natural inclinations. Put simply, there is no right of
                    recourse to the courts where an arbitrator has simply made an error of law
                    and/or fact. <em>A fortiori</em>, the courts should guard
                    against attempts by a disgruntled party to fault an arbitrator for failing to
                    consider arguments or points which were never before him. The setting aside
                    application is not to be abused by a party who, with the benefit of hindsight,
                    wished he had pleaded or presented his case in a different way before the
                    arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In our view, the main issue in this appeal,
                        <em>viz</em>, whether the Judge was correct in finding
                    that the sole arbitrator had not addressed his mind to the Disputed Counterclaim
                    and thereby failed to deal with an essential issue in the dispute can be
                    answered by considering the following two sub-issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     What was the Respondents’ case
                        with respect to the Disputed Counterclaim in the arbitration?
                        (“Issue 1”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the light of Issue 1, can it be said that the
                        arbitrator had not addressed his mind to the Disputed Counterclaim?
                        (“Issue 2”)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In our view, Mr Kumar’s repeated
                    assertions that the Appellants’ debit notes only related to the
                    Group A Goods but not the Group B Goods served, with respect, to
                    confuse rather than clarify matters. Stripped to its core, the
                    Respondents’
                    <em>entire</em> case rested on the premise that it was
                        <em>common ground</em> before the arbitrator that there
                    was <em>no allegation whatsoever</em> in the arbitral
                    proceedings that the so-called Group B Goods were <em>defective</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     After reviewing the relevant source materials,
                    it is clear, in our view, that this was <em>not</em> the
                    case. On the contrary, we are satisfied that it was not only the
                    Appellants’ case but <em>also</em> (and more
                    importantly) <em>the Respondents’ own case</em> that
                    the issue as to whether the Appellants were liable for the Disputed Counterclaim
                    was <em>directly linked</em> to the <em>issue</em> of <em>defectiveness</em> in the
                    goods (in general and not only in relation to the so-called Group B Goods).
                    We shall explain our conclusion with reference to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     the parties’ pleadings (see
                        below at [57]–[65]);</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30. Paragraphs 43 to 49 of the Amended Reply to Defence and Defence
                        to Counterclaim are denied. [The Appellants were] in control of the plant
                        and the production of the goods and are liable for any defects in the goods,
                        which is an afterthought concocted by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is clear from the face of the pleadings in
                    the BOA Arbitration that the parties had joined issue to the effect that the
                    claim for the amounts stated in para 63 of the BOA Counterclaim (<em>which includes the entire Disputed Counterclaim</em>) (see
                    above at [58]) depended on who was responsible for the alleged <em>defects</em> in goods which had been “continuously
                    supplied” (see, in particular, para 49 of BOA Defence to
                    Counterclaim (reproduced above at [59]) and para 30 of the BOA Reply to
                    Defence to the Counterclaim (reproduced above at [60])). Put simply, on the face
                    of the pleadings, the allegations of defects in goods went further than the
                    goods which the debit notes related to (<em>ie</em>, what
                    the parties now characterise as Group A Goods). They included allegations
                    of defectiveness against the goods which were “continuously
                    supplied” by the Respondents to the Appellants. This, in our view, would
                    include the Group B Goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(B)   The SA Arbitration pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Even though the Disputed Counterclaim formed
                    part of the Respondents’ counterclaim in the BOA Arbitration, the
                    Respondents <em>themselves</em> referred to it in the SA
                    Arbitration. In the SA Arbitration Defence and Counterclaim (“SA
                    Counterclaim”) at para 44.5, the Respondents referred to the sum
                    which comprised the Disputed Counterclaim under the heading “Breach of
                    the HOA and the SA, as follows”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.5. The [Appellants] have refused to pay for the <em>goods supplied</em> by [the Respondents] to [the Appellants] to
                        the amount of approximately RM5.8 million which has resulted [in]
                        losses in [the Respondents] due to having to provide for bad debts.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Appellants’ response to the
                    Respondents’ allegations that RM5.8 million were owed for goods
                    delivered (<em>ie</em>, the RM5,838,956 which comprised the
                    Disputed Counterclaim) can be found in the Reply to Defence and Defence to
                    Counterclaim in the SA Arbitration (“SA Defence to Counterclaim”)
                    at para 44:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44. … In reply to paragraph 44.5, [the Appellants contend]
                        that [the Respondents] have <em>refused to pay for the goods

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     At para 28 of the Reply to Defence to the
                    Counterclaim in the SA Arbitration, the Respondents responded to para 44 of
                    the SA Defence to Counterclaim (as they did in the BOA Arbitration pleadings
                    (see above at [60])) by contending that it was the Respondents and not the
                    Appellants who were responsible for the defect in these goods:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28. With regard to [paragraph 44] of the Reply to Defence and Defence

                        were defective was only later when [the Respondents] sought for payment.
                            <em>The allegation that the Goods were defective is an
                            afterthought and concocted by</em> [<em>the

                        unjustified termination of the LA. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Again, it is clear from the pleadings the SA
                    Arbitration that the parties had joined issue to the effect that the obligation
                    to pay the RM5,838,956 (<em>ie</em>, the Disputed
                    Counterclaim) for goods delivered (<em>ie</em>, what the
                    Judge referred to as the <em>Group B</em> Goods) was
                    related to the question of who was responsible for the <em>defects</em> in goods produced <em>in
                        general</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The framework of issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We next consider the respective parties’
                    lists of issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(A)   The Respondents’ list of issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As already noted above (at [26]), the
                    Respondents’ list of issues phrased the issues relating to the Disputed
                    Counterclaim in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15. Whether [the Appellants are] indebted to [the
                        Respondents] for <em>goods sold and delivered</em> by

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">15.1   Whether the <em>defects</em> in the goods <em>so
                                    delivered</em> are the responsibility of [the Appellants]
                                or [the Respondents];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">18. If the Tribunal finds in favour of [the Respondents] in [the BOA
                            Arbitration] whether [the Respondents are] entitled to claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">18.3 the sum owing by [the Appellants] to [the Respondents] of
                            RM 5,838,956.00; …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We note, parenthetically, that there was no separate paragraph
                        in the Respondents’ list of issues dealing with the bank balance of
                        RM22,185.88.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mr Kumar conceded that, on its face,
                    paras 15, 15.1 and 18 of the Respondents’ list of issues, when read
                    together, <em>expressly linked</em> the issue of <em>defects</em> of goods to the Appellants’ obligation to
                    pay for the entire Disputed Counterclaim (which we would add, includes the
                    RM22,185.88 bank balance which had <em>nothing</em> to do
                    with the goods sold and delivered). He explained that it was drafted in this
                    manner because the Appellants’ only reason for not paying for the
                    Group B Goods was that they had not been paid the amounts due on the debit
                    notes (which related to the Group A Goods). Notwithstanding the way the
                    list of issues was drafted, he argued that, read in its proper context, it was
                    clear that the issue of the defectiveness of goods in general was not meant to
                    be linked to the issue of payment for the Group B Goods and that the
                    counterclaim for the Group B Goods was a complete stand-alone
                issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     With respect, we are at a loss to understand
                    how the argument just made in the preceding paragraph could pass muster based on
                        <em>any reasonable reading</em> of paras 15, 15.1
                    and 18. Mr Kumar’s concession that this issue was poorly drafted was,
                    with respect, neither here nor there. In fact, contrary to it being
                    “poorly drafted”, the manner in which paras 15, 15.1 and 18
                    were drafted is <em>entirely consistent</em> with the
                        <em>Respondents’ own</em> case in both the BOA
                    and the SA Arbitration that the issue of the alleged <em>defects</em> in the goods and the liability for the Group B
                    Goods were inextricably linked (see above at [60] and [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We should also point out that <em>nowhere</em> in the Respondents’ list of issues (or in
                    their pleadings for that matter) is cl 5.2 of the BOA and cl 5.2.1 of
                    the ASA (the terms of which are summarised above at [10(a)] and [10(b)])
                    referred to as the contractual basis for the Disputed
                Counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(B)   The Appellants’ list of issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The salient parts of the Appellants’
                    list of issues read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Whether [the Respondents] breached clause 5.4.1 of the BOA in that
                        [they] failed to deliver the products ordered by [the Appellants] within
                        8 weeks from the date of expiry of the 2-month Notice
                        Period…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Whether [the Respondents] breached clause 5.4.3 of

                        inventory…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">2.1 Whether [the Respondents] were required to hold a minimum raw
                            material inventory of 40% on a per line item basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. Whether [the Respondents’] breach of clause 5.4.3 of the BOA
                        contributed to the breach of [their] undertaking in clause 5.4.1 of the
                        BOA…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4. Whether [the Respondents] breached clause 4.1 of the LA in that
                        [they] failed to deliver the products in accordance with the standards set
                        out therein.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    If the Tribunal finds in favour of [the
                            Respondents] in in [the BOA Arbitration], whether [the Respondents are]
                            entitled to claim any of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.3 the amount of RM5,838,956.00 purportedly due and owing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Kumar submits, and we agree, that the
                    Appellants’ list of issues was drafted in such a manner as to suggest that
                    the success of all of the Respondents’ counterclaims in the BOA
                    Arbitration (including the Disputed Counterclaim) depended on whether the
                    arbitrator was satisfied that the Respondents were in <em>breach</em> of the BOA and the LA. In other words, according to the
                    Appellants’ list of issues, the Respondents would <em>not</em> be entitled to the Disputed Counterclaim if the arbitrator
                    found that they were in <em>breach</em> of the BOA and the
                    LA. This was entirely consistent with the Appellants’ pleaded case as
                    described in para 49 of the BOA Defence to Counterclaim (reproduced above
                    at [59]) (and to a lesser extent at para 44 of the SA Defence to
                    Counterclaim (reproduced above at [63])).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Written submissions before the arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Finally we turn to the written submissions of
                    the parties before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(A)   The Respondents’ written submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In their written submissions, the Respondents
                    referred to the Disputed Counterclaim under the heading “<em>Defective</em> Goods” [emphasis added]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1"><b>16.   </b>

                            were defective and on that pretext refused to pay for the <em>goods supplied</em> by [the
                        Respondents].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.2  In fact, the goods supplied by [the Respondents]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.8  [The Respondents’ Group Financial
                            Controller] in paragraph 15.3 of her witness statement highlighted
                            that the amount owed by [the Appellants] as at 31 January 2008 is
                            RM5,838,956.00 which is reflected as “receivables” in [the
                            Respondents’] audited accounts as at as at [<em>sic</em>] 31 January 2008… The amount owed by
                            [the Appellants] pursuant to trade is RM5,816,770 as seen at
                            note 13 under “an affiliate” at page 2979
                            (supporting documents and invoices appear at RBD vol 8
                            pages 2193 to 2232). The amount owed by [the Appellants] from cash
                            and bank balances is RM22,185.88…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.9  We respectfully submit that the defects in the
                            goods are not the responsibility of [the Respondents]. Quality is the
                            obligation of [the Appellants]. [The Respondents] ought to be reimbursed

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     A couple of significant points are apparent on
                    the face of the Respondents’ written submissions. First, there is no
                    express statement that the liability to pay for the so-called Group B Goods
                    derive from invoices or from cl 5.2 of the BOA. Secondly, the Respondents,
                    consistently with their approach in their pleadings and their list of issues
                    already discussed above, <em>explicitly linked</em> the
                    obligation of the Appellants to pay for the (undistinguished) “goods
                    supplied” with the question of whether these (undistinguished)
                    “goods supplied” were <em>defective</em>.
                    Thirdly, cl 5.7 of the BOA and cl 5.2.1 of the ASA are not referred to
                    as the legal basis for Disputed Counterclaim. We would add a further observation
                    to the effect that paras 16.1, 16.2 and 16.9 of the Respondents’
                    written submissions were not discussed in the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(B)   The Appellants’ written submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Mr Kumar submits (and the Judge found)
                    that the only paragraph in the Appellants’ written submissions dealing
                    with the receivables in relation to the Group B Goods was para 363,
                    which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">363. As regards the receivables amounting to RM5,838,956.00, we say that
                        the amount has not been proven. If at all the Tribunal were minded to accept
                        [the Respondents’ Group Financial Controller’s] explanation
                        under cross-examination – that the figure is based on the audited
                        accounts, though no breakdown is provided – we respectfully submit
                        that this amount should be set-off against any amounts that the Tribunal may
                        award to [the Appellants].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     On that basis, Mr Kumar maintained (and
                    the Judge found) that the Respondents’ case was simply that the <em>quantum</em> of the disputed Counterclaim has not been
                    proved. We do <em>not</em>, however, think that this
                    accurately describes the Respondents’ case in their written submissions.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">357.  Now as regards [the Respondents’]
                            Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim, it needs to be pointed out that
                            [the Respondents’] basis for seeking relief under the BOA
                            Arbitration is ambiguous. [The Respondents have] prayed for several
                            heads of damage, but the Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim <em>do not clearly disclose an action for breach of contract or
                                for misrepresentation</em>. …</p>

              <em>Notwithstanding the
                                above</em>, we will examine each head of damage as has been
                            prayed for, for what it is worth, and make our submission
                            accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">363.  As regards the receivables amounting to
                            RM5,838,956.00, we say that the amount has not been proven. If at all
                            the Tribunal were minded to accept [the Respondents’ Group
                            Financial Controller’s] explanation under cross-examination
                            – that the figure is based on the audited accounts, though no
                            breakdown is provided we respectfully submit that this amount should be
                            set-off against any amounts that the Tribunal may award to [the
                            Appellants].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On the face the Appellants’ submissions, therefore, the
                        argument that the <em>quantum</em> was not proven was
                        merely a <em>fall back</em> argument to their primary
                        argument under this heading to the effect that the Respondents’
                        pleadings did not even disclose a proper cause of action for the various
                        heads of damage in the first place (including the Disputed
                        Counterclaim).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Further, we also see strength in the
                    Appellants’ suggestion to the effect that the Respondents’ pleadings
                    were muddled; in particular, in the BOA Counterclaim, the Respondents appeared
                    to identify the legal basis of the Disputed Counterclaim as arising from either
                    a breach of contract or misrepresentation (see above at [19]). Yet, cl 5.7
                    of the BOA and cl 5.2.1 of the ASA were not referred to in these
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In addition, and more importantly,
                    para 363 has to be read in the light of the Appellants’ submissions

                        the products in accordance with the standards set out therein. According to
                        [one of the Appellants’ main witness of fact], [the joint venture]
                        faced quality issues almost right from the beginning when [the Respondents]
                        took over management. Initially, he said the problems were manageable but it
                            <em>got worse as time went by</em>.</p>

                        products.</p>

                        for the rectification works in respect of the defective products supplied by
                        [the Respondents]. In this respect, [the Appellants have] issued [the
                        Respondents] a total of 10 debit notes from 7.11.2005 –
                        17.1.2007. The debit notes remain unsatisfied to date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     We recognise that, read in isolation, the
                    submission cited in the preceding paragraph could be construed to relate only to
                    the Group A Goods since the claim for rectification costs pursuant to the
                    debit notes are mentioned but no mention is made of goods which were delivered
                    but not the subject of any debit notes (<em>ie</em>, the
                    Group B Goods). However, in the light of the pleadings and the lists of
                    issues, it is abundantly clear to us that the allegations of <em>defectiveness</em>, which constituted a “continuous
                    breach” of cl 4.1 of the LA, were directed at <em>all</em> goods supplied. In any event, even if this was not the case,
                    there is no denying that the fact it was the Respondents’
                    <em>own</em> case that the issue of payment for the
                    Group B Goods was <em>tied or linked to</em> the issue
                    of who was responsible for the defect of goods in general.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusions on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     To conclude on Issue 1, for the reasons
                    set out above, contrary to the repeated refrain of Mr Kumar during the oral
                    submissions that it was neither parties’ case that if there are defective
                    goods the Respondents should not receive payment for the Group B Goods, we agree
                    with Mr Kumrasingam that this was <em>precisely</em>
                    the case that the <em>Respondents</em> themselves
                    ran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Before we proceed to consider Issue 2,
                    two observations are apposite. First, in the setting aside application, the
                    Respondents now state that the contractual basis of the Disputed Counterclaim
                    was cl 5.7 of the BOA (in relation to the Group B Goods) and
                    cl 5.2.1 of the ASA (in relation to the RM22,158.88 bank balances). This
                    was, presumably, to bolster their argument that the arbitrator’s basis for
                    the Disputed Counterclaim was clearly far removed from the rest of the issues in
                    the arbitration. These two provisions, however, did not appear once in the
                    source documents. In short, the Respondents have attempted to recharacterise and
                    clarify their (with respect, confusing and muddled) case in the setting aside
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Secondly, the Respondents now argue that the
                    Appellants’ list of issues was wrong and misleading because it failed to
                    characterise the Disputed Counterclaim as a stand-alone issue. These arguments
                    have been made notwithstanding the fact that this is what their <em>own</em> list of issues (based on any reasonable reading)
                    suggests. Accordingly, the Respondents’ blatant attempt to rely on this
                    recharacterised case and to pin the blame on the Appellants ought to be
                    rejected. Put simply, the Respondents are seeking to put forward the case they
                    wished they had put forward before the arbitrator and not the case which was
                    actually run in the arbitral proceedings themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We next turn to consider whether the
                    arbitrator did in fact deal with the Disputed Counterclaim in the light of our
                    findings on Issue 1. In this regard, the observations of this court in
                        <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> (at [65(f)]) are apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It must always be borne in mind that it is not the function of the
                        court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in attempting to
                        determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process; rather,
                        an award should be read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the
                        rules of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately
                        remedied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The English decisions of <em>Atkins Limited v The Secretary of State for Transport</em> [2013]
                    EWHC 139 (TCC) (“<em>Aktins</em>”) and
                        <em>Zermalt Holdings SA v Nu-Life Upholstery Repairs
                        Ltd</em> [1985] 2 EGLR 14 (“<em>Zermalt</em>”) (which were referred to by Chan Seng Onn J
                    in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>TMM Division Maritima
                        SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 972
                    at [44] and [45]) are consistent with our local jurisprudence in relation to the
                    “generous approach” which the court ought to take in reviewing
                    arbitral awards for breaches. In short, the court is not required to carry out a
                    hypercritical or excessively syntactical analysis of what the arbitrator has
                    written (see <em>Atkins</em> at [36]). Nor should the court
                    approach an award with a meticulous legal eye endeavouring to pick holes,
                    inconsistencies and faults in awards, with the objective of upsetting or
                    frustrating the process of arbitration. Rather, the award should be read in a
                    reasonable and commercial way, expecting, as is usually the case, that there
                    will be no substantial fault that can be found with it (see, for example,
                        <em>Zermalt</em> at 14).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Respondents’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Aside from his argument that it was common
                    ground that no allegations of defectiveness were made against the Group B
                    Goods (which we have held above to be incorrect), Mr Kumar relies heavily
                    on the following “gaps” in the award to support his case theory
                    that the arbitrator must have adopted the Appellants’ list of issues over
                    the Respondents’ list of issues without actually considering the issues
                    stated therein and which resulted in the arbitrator failing to consider the
                    Disputed Counterclaim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     the absence of para 15 of the
                        Respondents’ list of issues (but for obvious reasons following our
                        discussion on Issue 1, not para 15.1) in the arbitrators’
                        list of issues for determination;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     the express statements from the arbitrator at
                        para 1.9.1 of the award that he accepted the Appellants’ list of
                        issues “as a convenient framework” to consider the
                        Respondents’ counterclaims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     the lack of any discussion of the legal basis of the
                        payment for the Group B Goods or whether the quantum of the Disputed
                        Counterclaim had been proved; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_d"></a>(d)     the apparent logical disconnect in the arbitrator’s
                        conclusion that he did not have to consider the Disputed Counterclaim
                        because of his conclusions on what the Respondents now say are unrelated
                        issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arbitrator addressed his mind to the Disputed
                Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Looking at the award as a whole and having
                    regard to the source documents, it is clear, in our view, that the arbitrator
                        <em>did</em> in fact address his mind to the Disputed
                    Counterclaim and did, in fact, render a decision in respect of that particular
                    claim. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     First, the arbitrator noted at the start of
                    the award that (i) the Respondents were alleging that the Appellants failed
                    to pay Respondents for the goods it purchased (see para 1.3.3(l)); and
                    (ii) that the Respondents’ Group Financial Controller (who gave
                    evidence concerning the claim for the Disputed Counterclaim) was a witness of
                    fact (see para 1.5.1(f)). We should add, parenthetically, that there was
                    evidence before us that the arbitrator had personally noted down where the
                    invoices for (what the parties now characterise as) the Group B Goods could
                    be found in the Respondents’ bundle of documents. Although this is not by
                    itself determinative, this clearly suggested that the arbitrator had the
                    Disputed Counterclaim in mind (at least during the hearing).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Secondly, the Respondents’ case theory
                    that the arbitrator had simply adopted the Appellants’ list of issues
                    without any consideration of the Respondents’ list of issues is simply not
                    borne out on a closer analysis of the Appellants’, Respondents’, as
                    well as the arbitrator’s lists of issues. In fact, the Judge acknowledged
                    this at [25] of the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     All four issues identified by the arbitrator
                    as relating to the Appellants’ claim in the BOA Arbitration (Issue #1
                    to Issue #4 which has been reproduced at [24] above) appeared in both
                    parties’ separate lists of issues. This was notwithstanding his comment at
                    para 1.8.1 that he had adopted the Appellants’ list of issues as a
                    convenient framework. More importantly for our purposes, of the nine issues
                    identified by the arbitrator as relating to the Respondents’ counterclaim
                    in the BOA Arbitration (Issue #11 to Issue #19), only one featured
                    exclusively in the Appellants’ list of issues and four featured in both
                    parties’ lists of issues. The remaining four issues featured only in the
                    Respondents’ list of issues (and were adopted almost <em>verbatim</em> by the arbitrator). These were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Appellants had made
                        misrepresentations in order to induce the Respondents to enter into the
                        joint venture (identified by the arbitrator as
                    Issue #12);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Appellants performed their obligations under the joint venture
                        (identified by the arbitrator as Issue #13);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the Appellants acted in a
                        manner to frustrate the joint venture (identified by the arbitrator as
                        Issue #14); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_d"></a>(d)     if the arbitrator finds in favour of the Respondents on
                        Issue #14, whether the HOA, SA, BOA, ASA and LA are terminated
                        (identified by the arbitrator as Issue #15).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     This suggests to us that, instead of blindly
                    adopting the Appellants’ list of issues, the arbitrator had read and
                    carefully considered both lists of issues before identifying the live issues
                    before him. This was notwithstanding his remarks at para 1.9.1 of the award
                    which could be narrowly (and incorrectly) construed as suggesting that he only
                    had regard to the Appellants’ list of issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arbitrator determined the Disputed Counterclaim on the
                Respondents’ own case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Thirdly, in view of our conclusion on
                    Issue 1, there was no real need for the arbitrator to expressly identify
                    the legal basis of the Disputed Counterclaim if he took the view (as he plainly
                    must have) that the question as to who was responsible for the alleged <em>defects</em> in the goods <em>in
                        general</em> was <em>directly linked to</em> the
                    issue of payment for <em>any</em> goods delivered. Hence,
                    when the arbitrator found that the Respondents were in breach of cl 4.1 of
                    the LA, he had <em>also</em> (and simultaneously)
                    determined <em>the Disputed Counterclaim</em> on <em>the Respondents’ own case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     We recognise that, on a strict and literal
                    reading of the paras 5.3 to 5.5 of the award (reproduced above at [30]),
                    the arbitrator appeared to have concluded that the Disputed Counterclaim did not
                    arise solely because of his findings in relation to Issue #13 and
                    Issue #14 (and not because of any allegations of defects in the goods).
                    This was, in fact, the way in which the Judge construed the award and this was
                    the construction which Mr Kumar had urged us to adopt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In our view, the Judge’s reading of the
                    award can be attributed to her starting premise: that it was common ground that
                    there were no allegations whatsoever of defectiveness in relation to the
                    Group B Goods. However, as already explained in detail above, this premise
                    was, with respect, erroneous. While it may be common ground before us (and the
                    Judge) that there were no allegations whatsoever of defectiveness in relation to
                    the Group B Goods this was, strictly speaking, irrelevant. As demonstrated
                    above, it appeared to be common ground before the arbitrator that the issue of
                    payment for the goods which were the subject of the Disputed Counterclaim
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Group B Goods) were inextricably
                    linked to the issues of responsibility for the <em>defectiveness</em> in the goods (in <em>general</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In any event, this literal reading of the
                    award is difficult to reconcile with the Judge’s own observations (at [48]
                    of the Judgment, and which were echoed in the Respondents’ submissions
                    before us). As the Judge pointed out, the manner in which the arbitrator had
                    framed the issues suggests that he thought that the Respondents would not be
                    entitled to the amounts counterclaimed (including the Disputed Counterclaim) if
                    they were in <em>breach</em> of the BOA <em>and the LA</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     We would add that the arbitrator’s
                    decision that the Respondents had not made out their counterclaim for
                    misrepresentation (Issue #12) (see above at [30]) <em>must
                        have been relevant</em> to his conclusion that he did not have to
                    consider the remedies for the counterclaims. This was the case, <em>notwithstanding</em> his failure to expressly state that
                    Issue #16 was related to his conclusion on Issue #12. We therefore do
                    not think that para 5.5.1 of the award (see above at [30]) should be read
                    literally. Put simply, an award cannot be read like a statute; the ratio of the
                    award ought to be distilled from a reading of the entire award and not of
                    isolated parts. Although we acknowledge that para 5.5.1 could have been
                    better phrased, the arbitrator could not, in our view, have meant that all of
                    the counterclaims were determined based <em>solely</em> on
                    his decision with regard to Issue #13 and Issue #14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In the circumstances, there was plainly no
                    breach of natural justice in this situation; nor can it be said that the
                    arbitrator failed to apply his mind to the critical issues and arguments in the
                    dispute. In the circumstances, we would allow the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">In any event, there was no breach of natural justice even taking the
                Respondents’ case at its highest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     However, <em>assuming</em> (for the sake of argument) we take the
                    Respondents’ case at its highest and accept that (i) it was common
                    ground before the arbitrator that the issue of defective goods was not linked to
                    the issue of payment for the Group B Goods and (ii) that the
                    arbitrator had in fact determined that the Disputed Counterclaim did not arise
                    because of his findings on Issue #13 and Issue #14, we are <em>still</em> of the view that the appeal ought nevertheless to
                    succeed. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Based on his version of the parties’
                    case before the arbitrator, Mr Kumar attempted to make out a case before us
                    that the arbitrator had got the decision wrong and that the practical result of
                    the arbitrator’s decision was that the Appellants had managed to obtain
                    the (non-defective) Group B Goods gratis, having taken delivery but not
                    having paid for them. However, it will be recalled that we had observed above at
                    [52] that this court can only interfere with the arbitral award if there has
                    been <em>a denial of natural justice</em>. It bears
                    repeating that this court cannot interfere if there has, instead, been an error
                    (even a serious error) of law and/or fact on the part of the arbitrator. Put
                    simply, the <em>substantive merits</em> of the arbitral
                    award are <em>outside</em> the remit of this
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Taking the Respondents’ case at its
                    highest, the arbitrator came to the conclusion that he did not have to address
                    the substantive merits of the Disputed Counterclaim because he thought it was a
                    relief sought pursuant to the Respondents’ claims that the Appellants
                    acted in a manner to frustrate the joint venture (Issue #13) and had acted
                    in breach of certain (objectively unrelated) terms of the joint venture
                    agreement (Issue #14). In other words, and as the Judge herself observed,
                    it had slipped the arbitrator’s notice that the Disputed Counterclaim was
                    actually an independent and distinct claim that had to be dealt with
                    independently of his findings on Issue #13 and
                Issue #14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As we have already mentioned, we are of the
                    view that the arbitrator had read and considered both parties’ list of
                    issues and so we do not accept the Respondents’ case theory that the
                    arbitrator had blindly adopted the Appellants’ list of issues over the
                    Respondents’ list of issues. In such a situation, even if the arbitrator
                    decided (erroneously) that the resolution of the issues as set out (only) in the
                    Appellants’ list of issues would resolve all disputes between the parties,
                    the error alleged by the Respondents went merely to the <em>substantive merits</em> of the arbitrator’s decision as it
                    consisted in the arbitrator conflating issues of law and/or fact which he ought
                    not to have done. Put simply, even taking the Respondents’ case <em>at its highest</em>, the result is that the arbitrator had
                    misunderstood the arguments presented to him and had erroneously assumed that
                    the Disputed Counterclaim, as a remedy, arose out of a different and completely
                    unrelated contractual right. Whilst this may be a serious error of law and/or
                    fact, it does <em>not</em> follow that the
                    Respondents’ were denied natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Further observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As mentioned above (at [5]), the Judgment
                    raised some interesting questions in relation to the operation of Art 33(3)
                    and the power of remission under Art 34(4). Both merit some brief
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Art 33(3) of the Model Law </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    We had mentioned previously that the Judge
                    suggested in her concluding remarks (at [103] of the Judgment) that this case
                    would be the type of case that Art 33(3) of the Model Law was intended to
                    provide redress for. Article 33(3) of the Model Law states, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article 33. Correction and
                            interpretation of award; additional award</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party,
                            with notice to the other party, may request, within thirty days of
                            receipt of the award, the arbitral tribunal to make an additional award
                            as to claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but <em>omitted</em> from the award. If the arbitral tribunal
                            considers the request to be justified, it shall make the additional
                            award within sixty days.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The Judge observed that she hoped that
                    parties in future cases of a similar nature would first attempt to avail
                    themselves of any available opportunities to seek redress from the tribunal
                    itself, before turning to the courts if it was possible in the circumstances.
                    Three observations are apposite in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    First, Art 33(3) is a non-mandatory
                    provision <em>in the sense</em> that parties can agree
                    between themselves that Art 33(3) does not apply to their arbitration. The
                    Judge’s observation was therefore only relevant to a situation where
                    parties have not opted out of the application of Art 33(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Secondly, it is clear from the wording of
                    Art 33(3) of the Model Law that the provision can only be invoked if the
                    arbitrator <em>omitted</em> to make a determination on a
                    claim which had been presented to it. Article 33(3) thus deals with a
                    situation where the tribunal acted <em>infra petita</em>
                    and did not entirely fulfil its mandate (see Dr Peter Binder, <em>International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL
                        Model Law Jurisdictions</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    3rd ed, 2010) at [6-112]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    However, even on the Judge’s own
                    analysis, the arbitrator had <em>not</em> entirely omitted
                    to deal with the Disputed Counterclaim. Rather, in the Judge’s view, this
                    was a situation in which the arbitrator had breached the rules of natural
                    justice by failing to consider the Respondents’ case on the Disputed
                    Counterclaim, such failure being most likely due to his extensive adoption of
                    the Appellants’ list of issues. As a result, the arbitrator <em>had determined</em> the Disputed Counterclaim, albeit without
                    addressing its substantive merits after assuming (wrongly) that it was a relief
                    sought pursuant to unrelated claims by the Respondents. In such a situation, it
                    is, with respect, doubtful that Art 33(3) could have been invoked to cure
                    the breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Thirdly, assuming for the sake of argument
                    that Art 33(3) could have been invoked, a further question arises. It is
                    clear that the Model Law supports the principle of minimal curial intervention.
                    To this end, as long as the parties do not agree otherwise, the Model Law
                    provides <em>via</em> Art 33(3) a mechanism for a
                    party to seek redress from the arbitrator first before turning to the courts
                    when he believes that the arbitrator had omitted to deal with a stand-alone
                    claim presented to him. In such circumstances, should a party be entitled to
                    ignore Art 33(3) and instead apply to set aside the entire award under
                    Art 34, knowing that the court may in appropriate circumstances fall back
                    on its powers to remit part of the award back to the tribunal under
                    Art 34(4) if it decides that setting aside the entire award is not the
                    appropriate remedy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On the one hand, it is arguable that a party
                    ought to be penalised if he does not invoke Art 33(3) before invoking
                    Art 34 (assuming that the relevant circumstances permitted recourse to
                    Art 33(3)). If not, Art 33(3) would be rendered toothless and moribund
                    as there is simply no incentive for a disgruntled party to invoke it. If a party
                    is not penalised for relying on Art 34 without first invoking Art 33(3), this
                    could potentially be seen as an abuse of the setting aside process under
                    Art 34 of the Model Law, particularly in situations where the party is
                    alleging that the tribunal had failed to deal with a relatively minor claim in
                    the light of that party’s entire claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The present case itself illustrates, in
                    stark relief, this point. The Respondents’ entire counterclaim was valued
                    at approximately RM220 million. The Respondents then attempted to set aside
                    the <em>entire</em> award on the basis that the arbitrator
                    failed to consider a counterclaim of about RM6 million, which was <em>less than 3%</em> of the total amount claimed. In fact, it
                    was only during oral submissions before the Judge that the Respondents conceded
                    that the Judge could set aside only the part of the award which dealt with the
                    Disputed Counterclaim (presumably under Art 34(4) of the Model Law (which
                    we will address in a moment)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    To this end, Robert Merkin and Johanna
                    Hjalmarsson, <em>Singapore Arbitration Legislation
                        Annotated</em> (Informa, 2009), suggest (at p 64) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there is a provision in Model Law, art. 33(3), for an
                        application to the arbitrators to make an additional award on claims
                        presented to them but omitted from the award, and if no such application is
                        made then the court might refuse to lend its assistance [by setting aside
                        the award] on the basis of the waiver principle. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In fact, this is the position under the
                    English Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (“1996 UK Act”). Under
                    s 57 of the 1996 UK Act, which is similar to Art 33(3) of the Model
                    Law, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, an English tribunal can
                    make an additional award in respect of a claim presented to it but which was not
                    dealt with in the award. Further, an English award can be set aside under
                    s 68 of the 1996 UK Act on grounds similar to those set out in Art 34
                    of the Model Law. However, s 70(2) of the 1996 UK Act expressly states that
                    an application to set aside an award under s 68 of the 1996 UK Act may not
                    be brought if the applicant has not first exhausted the recourse under
                    s 57. This is the case even if the applicant might think that the award is
                    unsalvageable (see the English High Court decision of <em>Sinclair v Woods of Winchester Ltd and another</em> [2005] EWHC 1631
                    (QB) at [38]). We would observe that even though there is no equivalent of
                    s 70(2) of the 1996 UK Act in the Model Law, the premise behind
                    s 70(2) of the 1996 UK Act is consistent with the principle of minimal
                    curial intervention which has been endorsed by our courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    On the other hand, we recognise that
                    Art 33(3) merely states that a party “may request” the
                    tribunal to make an additional award for claims presented to it but which were
                    omitted from the award. In other words, based on the literal language of
                    Art 33(3) itself, it could be argued that a party is not <em>obliged</em> to invoke it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Further, the drafters of the Model Law
                    appeared to have envisaged that remission under Art 34(4) of the Model Law
                    (set out below at [118]) provided an alternative means from Art 33(3) of
                    avoiding the setting aside of the entire award when the tribunal omitted to deal
                    with points which could be separated from points already dealt with in the award
                    (see Fourth Secretariat Note in Howard M Holtzmann and
                    Joseph E Neuhaus, <em>A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law
                        on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and
                        Commentary</em> (Kluwer Law and Taxation, 1994) at
                p 897).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    It is possible to reconcile these two
                    seemingly opposed positions (set out above at [110]–[113] and
                    [114]–[115], respectively) by recognising that whilst a party is not
                    obliged to invoke Art 33(3), he takes the risk that the court would not, in
                    a setting aside application, exercise its discretion to set aside any part of
                    the award or invoke the powers of remission under Art 34(4) of the Model
                    Law. However, as this question was not before this court and we did not have the
                    benefit of parties’ argument on this, this question will have to be
                    definitively resolved on a future occasion when it is necessary to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Before leaving this last mentioned point, we
                    should mention that we asked Mr Kumar in oral submissions why the
                    Respondents did not invoke Art 33(3) in the present proceedings, especially
                    since the Respondents took the position that <em>all</em>
                    the evidence was already before the arbitrator and it was simply a question of
                    reading the submissions and making a decision on whether the quantum of the
                    Disputed Counterclaim was proven. To be fair to Mr Kumar, this was not an
                    objection raised by the Appellants and we thus appreciate that he was dealing
                    with this point <em>ex tempore</em>. In future cases,
                    however, the applicant’s reasons for failing to resort to Art 33(3)
                    (where applicable) might have an impact upon whether the courts will exercise
                    its discretion to set aside an award under Art 34 of the Model
                Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Art 34(4) of the Model Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Finally, we turn briefly to the
                    Judge’s holding at [101] of the Judgment that it was “appropriate
                    to remit the Disputed Counterclaim for the [receivables] and costs thereof to a
                    new tribunal (which is to be constituted) for determination”. Although
                    the Judge did not state the legal basis of her power to do so, the only
                    explicable basis was Art 34(4) of the Model Law, which states as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court, when asked to set aside an award, may, where appropriate and so
                        requested by a party, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of
                        time determined by it in order to give <em>the arbitral
                            tribunal</em> an opportunity to <em>resume the
                            arbitral proceedings</em> or to <em>take such other
                            action as in the arbitral tribunal’s opinion will eliminate the
                            grounds for setting aside</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In our view, even assuming that the case was
                    an appropriate one for remission because it concerned a stand-alone issue, the
                    clear language of Art 34(4) does not, with respect, permit the remission of
                    the award (without more) to a newly constituted tribunal. It has been observed
                    in Blackaby <em>et al</em>, <em>Redfern and
                        Hunter on International Arbitration</em>, (OUP, 5th ed, 2009) (at
                    [10.34]) that Art 34(4) is in fact “an equivalent provision to that
                    of remitting the award to the tribunal for <em>reconsideration</em>” [emphasis added]. That the matter must
                    be remitted to the same tribunal is also supported by Art 32(3) of the
                    Model Law which provides that the mandate of an arbitral tribunal terminates,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, on the issuance of the final
                    award, subject only to the provision of Art 33 <em>and
                        Art 34(4)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    We would thus respectfully disagree with the
                    Judge to the extent that she had assumed that the court had the power to remit
                    part of an award back to a <em>new tribunal</em> without
                    more. Although the issue was not strictly before us, it was arguable that if the
                    arbitrator had indeed failed to consider and determine the Disputed Counterclaim
                    because of a pure oversight, then one course of action open to the Judge would
                    have been to remit the award back to the arbitrator under Art 34(4). If
                    this was done, then assuming the Respondents were not planning to challenge the
                    arbitrator’s ability to determine the Disputed Counterclaim (and we see no
                    obvious reason why they would), it was only if the arbitrator himself decided to
                    withdraw (for example, because he felt that it was improper or impossible for
                    him to continue to sit as the arbitrator) that the parties would need to appoint
                    a substitute arbitrator in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Model
                    Law and the applicable procedural rules.</p>
