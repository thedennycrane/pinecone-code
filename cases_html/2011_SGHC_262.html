        V K Rajah JA:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application was made pursuant to s 15
                    of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (the
                    “LPA”) for Mr David Joseph QC (the
                    “Applicant”) to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor of
                    Singapore for the purpose of representing the plaintiffs in Originating Summons
                    (“OS”) No 807 of 2010 (“OS 807”) and OS
                    No 913 of 2010 (“OS 913”), specifically
                    Registrar’s Appeal (“RA”) No 278 of 2011
                    (“RA 278”), RA No 279 of 2011
                    (“RA 279”), Summons (“SUM”) No 4064 of
                    2011 (“SUM 4064”) and SUM No 4065 of 2011
                    (“SUM 4065”) and any further proceedings in relation to these
                    matters (including any appeals thereto). It bears mention that this was the
                    first application for an <em>ad hoc</em> admission of a
                    Queen’s Counsel since the application in OS No 621 of 2007 filed
                    on 23 April 2007 to admit Mr Gavin James Millar QC was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The second defendant in OS 807 and
                    OS 913, PT First Media TBK (formerly known as
                    “PT Broadband Multimedia TBK”), was the respondent in this
                    application (the “Respondent”). The Respondent vigorously objected
                    to the <em>ad hoc</em> admission of the Applicant on the
                    ground that the proceedings are not of sufficient difficulty and complexity to
                    warrant admission of a Queen’s Counsel. However, it is noteworthy that
                    both the Attorney-General and the Law Society of Singapore (the “Law
                    Society”) raised no objections in relation to the Applicant’s
                    application and agreed that the legal issues in the various proceedings were of
                    sufficient difficulty and complexity to warrant the exercise of judicial
                    discretion in favour of the Applicant’s admission (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> below). After hearing all parties, I allowed
                    the application. As such applications have been infrequent (and scarcely acceded
                    to) over the course of the last two decades, I think it will assist the Bar if
                    the reasons underpinning my decision are made known lest it be mistakenly
                    thought that the criteria for assessing such applications have been suddenly and
                    radically remodelled without legislative intervention (see also <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       OS 807 and OS 913 involved eight
                    plaintiffs and three defendants who had participated in arbitration proceedings
                    conducted under the auspices of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
                    (“SIAC”) in SIAC Arbitration No 62 of 2008 (the
                    “Arbitration”). Singapore was the seat of the Arbitration which
                    was conducted pursuant to the third edition of the SIAC Arbitration Rules,
                    1 July 2007 (the “SIAC Arbitration Rules”). The arbitral
                    tribunal consisted of two retired English Judges (Sir Simon Tuckey and
                    Sir Gordon Langley) and Mr Stewart Boyd QC (the
                    “Tribunal”). The eight plaintiffs nominated Sir Gordon
                    Langley as their arbitrator and the three defendants nominated Mr Stewart
                    Boyd QC as their arbitrator with Sir Simon Tuckey being jointly
                    appointed as the third arbitrator by both parties. The dispute concerned a
                    failed joint venture relating to the supply of satellite-delivered
                    direct-to-home pay television services in Indonesia. It has an extended,
                    complicated and sulphurous history that I need not restate in any detail for the
                    purposes of the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The eight plaintiffs were part of the Astro
                    Group, a Malaysian broadcasting and media entity, and comprised of
                    (a) Astro Nusantara International BV; (b) Astro Nusantara Holdings BV;
                    (c) Astro Multimedia Corporation NV; (d) Astro Multimedia NV;
                    (e) Astro Overseas Limited (formerly known as AAAN (Bermuda) Limited);
                    (f) Astro All Asia Networks PLC; (g) Measat Broadcast Networks Systems
                    Sdn Bhd; and (h) All Asia Multimedia Networks FZ-LLC (collectively referred
                    to as the “Plaintiffs”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The three defendants were
                    (a) PT Ayunda Prima Mitra (the “first defendant”);
                    (b) the Respondent; and (c) PT Direct Vision (the “third
                    defendant”) (collectively referred to as the “Defendants”).
                    The first defendant and the Respondent were part of an Indonesian conglomerate
                    called the “Lippo Group”, while the third defendant was the
                    purported joint venture company for the satellite TV venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Applicant was instructed by
                    WongPartnership LLP, and was the lead counsel for the Plaintiffs in the
                    Arbitration. Mr Laurence Rabinowitz QC was instructed by Drew &amp;
                    Napier LLC, and was the lead counsel for the first defendant and the
                    Respondent. Mr Davinder Singh SC was joint lead counsel for the first
                    defendant and the Respondent at the preliminary stages of the Arbitration, but
                    did not appear at the final merits hearing. Mr Oommen Mathew of
                    Eversheds LLP appeared for the third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the Arbitration, the Tribunal unanimously
                    granted five awards in favour of the Plaintiffs, namely (collectively referred
                    to as the “Awards”):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 7 May 2009 award (“the
                            Preliminary Award”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 3 October 2009 award;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 5 February 2010 award;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 16 February 2010 award;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 3 August 2010 award.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Awards comprised of very significant sums in
                    multiple currencies. In summary, the Defendants were found to be jointly and
                    severally liable for at least the aggregate sum of USD81,865,542.54,
                    GBP940,024.00, RM139,412,160.00 and SGD3,918,049.13. The third defendant was
                    additionally found liable for at least an aggregate sum of USD128,983,939.46 and
                    RM144,889,736.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Leave to enforce the Awards as judgments of the
                    High Court of Singapore were subsequently sought by the Plaintiffs, pursuant to
                    s 19 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (the “IAA”), first in OS 807 and subsequently in OS 913.
                    As OS 807 did not include an application for leave to enforce the final
                    award, interests and costs, OS 913 was filed for leave to enforce the same.
                    Leave was granted by Orders of Court on 5 August 2010 (for OS 807) and
                    3 September 2010 (for OS 913) (referred to henceforth collectively as
                    the “Enforcement Orders”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Enforcement Orders provided that in the
                    event that service of the Enforcement Orders was effected on the Defendants
                    outside the jurisdiction of Singapore, the Defendants were allowed to apply to
                    set aside the Enforcement Orders within 21 days after such service. The
                    Enforcement Orders were served on the Defendants in Indonesia, and the
                    Plaintiffs entered judgments in terms of the Awards on 24 March 2011 (the
                    “24 March 2011 Judgments”) when the Defendants did not apply
                    to challenge the Enforcement Orders within the stipulated timeframe of 21
                    days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, the Respondent filed SUM
                    No 1911 of 2011 (“SUM 1911”) and SUM No 1912 of
                    2011 (“SUM 1912”) on 3 May 2011 to set aside the
                    24 March 2011 Judgments on the basis that the service of the Enforcement
                    Orders was not valid and seeking leave to apply to set aside the Enforcement
                    Orders within 21 days of the Plaintiffs’ service of the Enforcement Orders
                    on the Respondent in accordance with the applicable laws of the Republic of
                    Indonesia governing the service of such documents. On 22 August 2011, an
                    Assistant Registrar (“AR”) hearing SUM 1911 and SUM 1912
                    decided that service of the Enforcement Orders was <em>not</em> valid. However, he also concurrently declared that the
                    Respondent was deemed to have been served with the Enforcement Orders on 22 Aug
                    2011 and granted the Respondent leave to set aside the Enforcement Orders by
                    12 September 2011 (<em>ie</em>, within 21 days from
                    his order).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 5 September 2011, the Plaintiffs filed
                    RA 278 and RA 279, appealing against the AR’s orders in
                    SUM 1911 and SUM 1912 respectively. On 12 September 2011, the
                    Respondent, in compliance with the AR’s order, filed SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065 to set aside the Enforcement Orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     RA 278, RA 279, SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065 have been fixed for hearing together before the same High Court
                    Judge, on account of various common issues of law. As regards to the urgency of
                    the hearing of these issues, the Counsel for the Applicant informed me that
                    there was a worldwide Mareva injunction currently in place and ongoing
                    proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, <em>viz</em>,
                    (a) a garnishee application in Hong Kong by the Plaintiffs on an alleged
                    creditor of the Respondent and (b) applications in Indonesia by the
                    Plaintiffs for the Indonesian Supreme Court to recognise the other arbitral
                    awards, although the Indonesian Supreme Court has refused to recognise the
                    Preliminary Award (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on <em>ad hoc</em> admission of English
                Queen’s Counsel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section 15(1) of the LPA is identical to
                    the section governing <em>ad hoc</em> admissions of

                        (the “third stage”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With regard to the first stage, the Court of
                    Appeal noted in <em>Godfrey Gerald QC v UBS AG and
                        others</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 306 (“<em>Godfrey Gerald</em>”) that the test of “sufficient
                    difficulty and complexity” was <em>conjunctive</em>
                    and not disjunctive, <em>viz</em>, the issues had to be of
                    sufficient difficulty <em>and</em> complexity. Such
                    difficulty and complexity is (see <em>Price Arthur Leolin v
                        Attorney-General and others</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 113
                        (“<em>Price QC</em>”) at [6]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">not limited to questions of law – it is foreseeable that [assistance
                        of Queen’s Counsel] will be valuable in cases dealing with complex
                        facts, so as to determine what the actual legal problems are before turning
                        to address those specific problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It has also been stressed that the absence of
                    direct local precedents is insufficient, in and of itself, to warrant the
                    admission of a Queen’s Counsel because decisions from other Commonwealth
                    jurisdictions may be referred to (<em>Godfrey Gerald</em>
                    at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At the second stage, the court is balancing
                    two competing interests, <em>viz</em> (a) the
                    long-term need to foster a strong and independent local Bar; against
                    (b) the individual justice of each case which might demand the assistance
                    of a Queen’s Counsel (<em>Re Flint Charles John Raffles
                        QC</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 433 (“<em>Raffles QC</em>”) at [8]). This is consonant with the original purpose of the 1991
                    amendments to the LPA “to lay the foundation for the development of a
                    strong local Bar by the imposition of more stringent conditions for the
                    admission of Queen’s Counsel to appear in our courts” (see
                        <em>Re Oliver David Keightley Rideal QC</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR(R) 961 at [8]; cited in
                        <em>Fortescue QC</em> at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At this point, it should be emphasised that
                    the first and second stages of the test are neither clearly demarcated nor
                    ordered lexically. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Fortescue QC</em> (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>difficulty and complexity of a case is not in and
                            of itself decisive</em> of the question whether a Queen’s
                        Counsel should be admitted. It has to be <em>weighed against
                            the availability and calibre of local counsel</em>. … Where
                        there is a dearth of local expertise in any area, e<em>ven a
                            moderately difficult or complex case may warrant the admission of a
                            Queen’s Counsel</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The thresholds prescribed by the first and
                    second stages are dependent, in part, upon the competence and maturity of the
                    local Bar. Taking into consideration advancements in legal education, the ever
                    greater exposure of Singapore advocates to increasingly complex areas of law at
                    the frontiers of legal evolution as well as the commendable elevation of
                    standards within the Bar, it has become increasingly difficult to satisfy the
                    Court that the legal issues and/or facts are of sufficient difficulty and
                    complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s Counsel
                        (<em>Fortescue QC</em> at [15]). Indeed, with the effluxion of time, it appears that local
                    Senior Counsel or experienced lawyers with particular expertise in the
                    respective areas of law will be able to handle competently most legal issues
                    that arise before Singapore courts. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Fortescue QC</em> (at [18]), “the standard of the local Bar has increased over
                    the years”. The High Court’s observations in <em>Raffles QC</em> at [9]
                    (affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Fortescue</em> at
                        [18]) are also apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After nearly a decade of the working out of s 21(1) of [the Legal
                        Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed)], it is in my view fair to
                        say that the local Bar has matured and is acquitting itself commendably.
                        There has been forged and carefully nurtured, particularly over the last ten
                        years, a body of Senior Counsel, potential senior counsel and an impressive
                        group of young advocates and solicitors, both in the public service and in
                        the private sector, with excellent academic credentials and a right
                        attitude.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With regard to the third stage, in determining
                    whether the applicant is a suitable candidate for admission, it should be noted
                    that in <em>Re Littlemore Stuart QC</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 198 (“<em>Littlemore
                    QC</em>”), the court observed that admission was a privilege which
                    required that the applicant display two essential qualities. First, his conduct
                    must satisfy that “he will be responsible, honourable, courteous and
                    respectful of our Judiciary” (<em>ibid</em> at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>). Second, he must be at “the
                    forefront of his area of specialisation so that he can adequately assist our
                    courts in our deliberations and the administration of justice” (<em>ibid</em> at [6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I pause to make an observation about the
                    authorities cited above. It appears that this three-stage approach is not
                    expressly mandated by s 15(1) of the LPA. Having considered the three-stage
                    test in greater detail, I am of the view that the test may be more coherently
                    conceived of as comprising two, <em>contra</em> three,
                    stages. This is because the <em>second stage</em> (which
                    purports to deal with whether the circumstances of the case warranted the
                    court’s exercise of discretion in favour of the applicant) is
                    intrinsically intertwined with the <em>third stage</em>
                    (which deals with whether the applicant was a suitable candidate for admission)
                    – it appears, to me, that the applicant’s suitability is, in the
                    final analysis, simply <em>one of the circumstances</em> to
                    be considered in determining whether the circumstances of the case warranted the
                    court’s exercise of discretion to admit the applicant. Indeed, I observe
                    that the second stage is phrased sufficiently broadly to <em>subsume</em> the third stage. After all, both stages are intended to
                    address the court’s mind to the question of <em>whether, in
                        all the circumstances of the case, the court should exercise its discretion
                        to admit the applicant</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     While it may appear that conceiving of the
                    test as comprising of two rather than three stages is an exercise in semantic
                    hair-splitting, I am of the view that there are <em>practical
                        benefits</em> to adopting a two-stage conceptualisation. For instance,
                    approaching the test in two stages avoids the possible misconception that the
                    court’s exercise of discretion (in the second stage) is <em>independent</em> of the applicant’s suitability (in the third
                    stage). It would also allow an applicant’s <em>special</em> expertise to be taken into consideration as part of a
                    holistic inquiry into whether this is a case in which the court should exercise
                    its discretion to admit the applicant in the context of available local
                    representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     That said, whether the test is approached in
                    two or three stages is immaterial for the present application as it was common
                    ground amongst all the parties, including the Respondent, that the third stage
                    was fulfilled (see <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> and <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I turn now to analyse whether the Applicant
                    should be admitted for the purposes of representing the Plaintiffs in the
                    relevant legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the issues are of sufficient difficult and
                complexity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my opinion, the legal issues in RA 278
                    and RA 279, if considered in isolation, would not be of sufficient
                    difficult and complexity to merit the exercise of discretion in favour of the
                    Applicant. RA 278 and RA 279 are premised on two relatively clear-cut
                    issues, <em>viz</em>, (a) whether service was in fact
                    effected in Indonesia and (b) if so, whether service was legally valid in
                    accordance with Indonesian law. The real merits of this application thus really
                    lay in the significance of the legal issues arising in SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065, which related to the setting aside of the Enforcement
                    Orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     With regard to SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065, it appears that there are indeed three sufficiently complex and
                    difficult issues of fact and law, which may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Defendants are entitled
                        to resist enforcement of the Awards in the country in which the Awards were
                        made when they did not, within the statutorily prescribed period, take any
                        steps to set aside the same
                    (“Issue 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Defendants have a right to revive a challenge
                        based on the alleged lack of an arbitration agreement and a misjoinder of
                        the sixth to eighth plaintiffs to the Arbitration well after the Award has
                        been made (“Issue 2”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the enforcement of an award in Singapore
                        can be affected by a ruling made in another country over the enforcement of
                        the same award (“Issue 3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I will elaborate on each issue in turn. In my
                    view, each of the three issues was of sufficient complexity and difficulty to
                    pass the threshold of the first stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The first issue was whether a party is
                    entitled to resist enforcement of the awards in the country in which the awards
                    were made (in the present case, Singapore) when it did not take any steps to set
                    aside the same within the statutorily prescribed period. An application for
                    setting aside the arbitral awards may not be made after three months have
                    elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received
                    the award (see Art 34(3) of the United Nations Commission on International
                    Trade Law Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration in the First
                    Schedule to the IAA). On the facts, there is no dispute that the Respondent was
                    out of time as far as any application to set aside the Awards was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, the Respondent has taken the position
                    that even though it did not apply to set aside the Awards in Singapore, it is
                    still entitled to resist their enforcement in Singapore. In support of its
                    position, the Respondent relies, <em>inter alia</em>, on
                    the very recent English Supreme Court decision in <em>Dallah Real
                        Estate and Tourism Holding Co v Ministry of Religious Affairs of the
                        Government of Pakistan</em> [2011] AC 763 (“<em>Dallah</em>”) to suggest that even while it chose not
                    to take any step to challenge the Preliminary Award, it nevertheless has an
                    inalienable right in the enforcement court to resist enforcement on the same
                    basis that it could have challenged the Preliminary Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     By way of background, in <em>Dallah</em>, an International Chamber of Commerce Tribunal sitting in
                    Paris (the “Paris Tribunal”) determined that it had jurisdiction
                    over the Government of Pakistan although the Government of Pakistan was not a
                    signatory to the relevant arbitration agreement. The English Supreme Court
                    refused to enforce the Paris Tribunal’s award against assets of the
                    Government of Pakistan held in England on the grounds that in applying French
                    Law, the Paris Tribunal was wrong to find that the Government of Pakistan was a
                    party to the relevant arbitration agreement. Although the Paris Tribunal had
                    earlier decided on the existence of its own jurisdiction, the English Supreme
                    Court was of the view that the Paris Tribunal’s findings of fact and view
                    of the law in determining its jurisdiction did not bind the courts at the place
                    of enforcement. <em>Dallah</em> has, it bears mention, been
                    the subject of intense debate amongst academics as well as international
                    arbitration practitioners regarding its effect on the principle of <em>Kompetenz-Kompetenz</em> (<em>ie</em>,
                    the principle whereby an arbitral tribunal is entitled to rule on its own
                    jurisdiction) and the enforceability of arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Singapore courts have not yet fully
                    considered the application of <em>Dallah</em>, which, being
                    a decision of the UK Supreme Court, merits careful consideration. Further, an
                    important distinction that may have legal significance is that the present case
                    is, from the perspective of enforcement, different from the matrix that informed
                    the decision in <em>Dallah</em>: here, <em>both</em> the supervisory and enforcement courts are the very same
                    court in Singapore. This raises thorny questions as to whether the ultimate
                    holding in <em>Dallah</em> should apply in a situation
                    where the seat of arbitration and place of enforcement are the same – a
                    question that remains unaddressed by courts in other jurisdictions. The
                    application of <em>Dallah</em> in the resolution of this
                    legal conundrum could have important implications for the arbitral and
                    commercial communities here and perhaps elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Counsel for the Applicant readily agreed that
                    it is <em>possible</em> for local counsel to make arguments
                    on these complex and difficult issues of law, but emphasised that it would
                        <em>greatly assist</em> the court to have a
                    Queen’s Counsel who is an acknowledged authority in international
                    arbitration to appear in the Singapore courts and elucidate on the implications
                    of the decision in <em>Dallah</em> and the consequences if
                    it were followed (or not followed, or followed in part as the case may
                        be).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second issue was that of whether a party
                    has a right to revive its challenge based on the alleged lack of an arbitration
                    agreement. The Respondent argues in its challenge in SUM 4064 and SUM 4065 that
                    the Enforcement Orders should be set aside because it was never a party to any
                    arbitration agreement with the sixth to eighth plaintiffs and therefore the
                    Tribunal lacked the jurisdiction <em>ab initio</em> to have
                    joined the sixth to eighth plaintiffs to the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In alleging that it never had an arbitration
                    agreement with the sixth to eighth plaintiffs within the meaning of the IAA, the
                    Respondent’s contention was simply based on a reference to the arbitration
                    clause in the underlying contract to which the sixth to eighth plaintiffs were
                    not signatories. It must be noted that the Tribunal had addressed this very
                    issue in the Preliminary Award by recognising the existence of a
                    “separate agreement arising when an existing dispute becomes the subject
                    of a reference to arbitration”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In doing so, the Tribunal noted the distinction
                    between an “agreement to refer future disputes to arbitration, and the
                    separate agreement arising when an existing dispute becomes the subject of a
                    reference to arbitration”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Tribunal
                    found in the Preliminary Award that the SIAC Arbitration Rules governed the
                    latter agreement. This distinction is known as the principle of
                    “double-severability”, and was explained in <em>Syska v Vivendi Universal SA &amp; Ors</em> [2008]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 636 (“<em>Syska</em>”). In <em>Syska</em>, Christopher
                    Clarke J noted (at [93]) that the principle of double-severability
                    “is foreign to most systems of law. But it serves as an example of how
                    the reference can have a life of its own …”. Thus far, there has
                    been no pronouncement in Singapore on the appropriateness of such a principle
                    and this is likely to be an issue considered in SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In resisting the application for the joinder
                    of the sixth to eighth plaintiffs on the basis that they were non-signatories to
                    the arbitration agreement, the Respondent had previously raised before the
                    Tribunal arguments based on “[the] twin doctrines of party consent and
                    confidentiality” which “lie at the foundation of the arbitration
                        process”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Respondent asserted that
                    it did not in fact consent to the said joinder, and that the Tribunal therefore
                    lacked the power to allow the same. It is noted that the Tribunal’s
                    decision on the “consent” required for the joinder was made under
                        r 24.1(<em>b</em>) of the SIAC Arbitration Rules,
                    which states that the Tribunal shall have the power to “allow other
                    parties to be joined in the arbitration with their express consent, and make a
                    single final award determining all disputes among the parties to the
                    arbitration”. Counsel for the Applicant highlighted that
                        r 24.1(<em>b</em>) has since been amended in the
                    fourth edition of the SIAC Arbitration Rules, 1 July 2010, to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">upon the application of a party, allow one or more third parties to be
                        joined in the arbitration, provided that such person is a party to the
                        arbitration agreement, with the written consent of such third party, and
                        thereafter make a single final award or separate awards in respect of all
                        parties …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The issue is further complicated by the Plaintiffs’ assertion
                    that the Respondent, by its signing of the Memorandum of Issues (which contains
                    terms confirming, acknowledging and agreeing to the Tribunal’s previous
                    finding on jurisdiction) on 31 July 2009 after the publication of the
                    Preliminary Award, has confirmed the independent and separate existence of an
                    agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The complexity associated with the joinder of
                    parties to an arbitration lies in determining whether the joinder mechanism can
                    be reconciled with the fundamental arbitration concepts of party consent,
                    autonomy and confidentiality. As recognised by the Tribunal,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the] questions of consolidation of arbitral proceedings and of joinder of
                        third parties have been very much debated in the last ten or fifteen years,
                        and that the doctrines of party consent and confidentiality have been at the
                        heart of the debate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Issue 2 had been and remains a hotly-contested matter, and both
                    counsel for the Applicant and counsel for the Respondent have agreed that there
                    were no judicial authorities directly on point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issue 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The third issue was whether the enforcement of
                    an award in Singapore is affected by a ruling made in another country over the
                    enforcement of the same award (<em>ie</em>, whether the
                    Awards should be enforced in Singapore given that the Indonesian Supreme Court
                    has refused to grant an <em>exequatur</em>). The
                    Respondent’s position is that the decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court
                    to decline to grant <em>exequatur</em> has no bearing on
                    the enforcement of the Awards in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I agreed with the Applicant that these
                    competing assertions need to be examined by reference to the principles relating
                    to the enforcement of international arbitration awards generally, and then
                    specifically in the situation where a court of another jurisdiction has
                    determined that the award in question is unenforceable in that jurisdiction. In
                    the present case, the fact that the courts in Indonesia decided not to grant
                        <em>exequatur</em> despite Indonesia being a party to
                    the New York Convention may increase the complexity of the issue of
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It also appeared to me that the <em>facts</em> involved in this issue are indeed intricately
                    laced. Issues pertaining to the enforcement of the Preliminary Award in
                    Indonesia featured in the course of the Arbitration, and the Applicant –
                    who had overall carriage of the matters in relation to the Indonesian legal
                    proceedings – was able to and did present arguments to the Tribunal on the
                    interplay between the Arbitration and the Indonesian legal proceedings. The fact
                    that Indonesia is a civil law jurisdiction further shaded the complexity of the
                    facts that had to be managed and elucidated upon by the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on whether there was sufficient difficulty and
                complexity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the final analysis, there can be no
                    gainsaying that the legal and factual issues raised in SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065 were indeed sufficiently complex and difficult to satisfy the
                    statutory threshold. That there was little in terms of judicial guidance
                    anywhere on the precise points raised added no small measure of powerful cogency
                    to this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In coming to this finding, I was aware that
                    the requirement of sufficient difficulty and complexity had in recent years been
                    notoriously difficult to satisfy. The complexity and difficulty of legal issues
                    must be comparable to those raised in <em>Re Sher Jules
                        QC</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Sher
                        Jules QC</em>”) at [16], where the legal issues spanning the law of restitution and
                    constitutional law were not just novel and not yet previously tried in any
                    jurisdiction in the world, but were undoubtedly considered at that point in the
                    legal development of the common law to be “seminal issues”.
                    Indeed, as Prof Tan Yock Lin incisively observed in the Singapore Academy
                    of Law, <em>Annual Review of Singapore Cases (3, 2002)</em>
                    at para 18.7, the result of <em>Sher
                        Jules QC</em> showed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Where the developing law discloses a diversity of
                            approaches and arguments, indicating that several choices are viable,
                            each choice reflecting a particular trade-off between justice and
                            certainty</em>, and where the context of its intended application
                        is delicate, involving as it does relationships between a regulator, a
                        commercial operator and potentially the tax authorities, this is also where
                        justice might better be done through a comparative understanding of the
                        issues such as <em>a suitably qualified QC might bring to the
                            case</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The issues relating to arbitration law in the
                    present application are undeniably of no small significance to the development
                    of the international arbitration law jurisprudence in Singapore. The
                    determination of these issues would involve the consideration of difficult
                    aspects of arbitration law, and would undoubtedly require careful and detailed
                    argument and, thereafter, considered judicial determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the circumstances of the case warranted the court’s
                exercise of discretion in favour of the Applicant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     With regard to the court’s exercise of
                    its discretion in determining if the Applicant should be admitted, counsel for
                    the Respondent strenuously argued that the Applicant should not be admitted
                    because the issues raised in the case can be competently handled by Singapore
                    counsel willing and available to act on behalf of the Plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Applicant
                    pointed out that the High Court had previously decided that the availability and
                    ability of local counsel is but just one of the factors to be considered, and is
                    not <em>per se</em> an absolute bar to admission of a
                    Queen’s Counsel (see <em>Caplan QC</em> at [17]; <em>Re Beloff Michael
                        Jacob QC</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 943 (“<em>Beloff QC</em>”) at [13]). The Respondent, in response, relied on dicta in the Court
                    of Appeal’s decision in <em>Fortescue QC</em> to
                    support its proposition that (see <em>Fortescue QC</em> at
                        [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a Queen’s Counsel ought not to be admitted no matter how difficult
                        and complex a case is <em>unless no local counsel is able and
                            willing to take the case. …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is our opinion that it will only be in the <em>most
                            exceptional circumstances</em> that a case is so difficult and
                        complex that no local counsel in Singapore is able and willing to take the
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I acknowledged that both <em>Caplan QC</em> and <em>Beloff QC</em>
                    were decisions of the High Court (<em>per</em> Yong Pung
                    How CJ). Accordingly, <em>Fortescue QC</em>
                    – which was a <em>subsequent</em> decision of the
                    Court of Appeal (presided over by Yong CJ) – should take
                    precedence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Nonetheless, I was of the opinion that the
                    stance taken by the Court of Appeal in <em>Fortescue QC</em> at [15] had to be construed contextually. There are at least four
                    reasons which suggest that the Court of Appeal probably did not intend to lay
                    down an iron rule of law dictating that the admission of Queen’s Counsel
                    would only be permissible where <em>absolutely no</em>
                    local counsel was able and willing to take up the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, it seems odd that if the Court of
                    Appeal intended to depart from an earlier stance consistently taken by the High
                    Court, no reference was made to this and a change in practice was mutely
                    introduced by way of a sidewind. I would further note that the Court of Appeal
                    had previously stated (in <em>Price QC</em> at
                        [8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Queen’s Counsel <em>will not be admitted for the
                            routine and the ordinary cases</em> which require <em>no special experience or knowledge</em> and which can be
                            <em>competently handled by Singapore lawyers</em>.
                        The salutary effect of s 21(1) therefore is that litigants are
                            <em>assured of the specialised services of Queen's
                            Counsel in cases of genuine complexity and difficulty</em>, while
                        the opportunities for specialisation among Singapore lawyers are gradually
                        developed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This observation, while making reference to the expertise of the local
                    Bar, falls short of the rather more strongly phrased statement in <em>Fortescue QC</em> at [15].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Second, the Court of Appeal’s
                    observation in [15] must be read against
                    the factual backdrop of the facts in <em>Fortescue QC.</em>
                    The Court of Appeal felt that the intellectual property issues that arose in
                    that case were not of sufficient difficulty and complexity, and that local
                    counsel was “well able” to address those issues (<em>Fortescue QC</em> at [20]). In forming such an opinion, the Court of Appeal
                    considered that of the two allegedly complex issues that arose, the first had
                    previously been decided by the UK courts and a whole body of case law existed in
                    that area (<em>ibid</em> at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), whereas the second – albeit not adjudicated upon
                    anywhere in the world – had already been competently dealt with by local
                    counsel at the trial below without assistance of foreign counsel (<em>ibid</em> at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Third, it should be noted that the Law Society
                    objected to the admission of the applicant in <em>Fortescue
                        QC</em>. In the Law Society’s view, other than the fact that the
                    issues lacked a sufficient degree of difficulty and complexity, the central
                    issue on appeal was one which was more appropriately dealt with by technical
                    experts and/or patent attorneys rather than <em>via</em>
                    submissions by Queen’s Counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Although these views were not
                    expressly mentioned by the Court of Appeal in its written judgment, the fact
                    that the Law Society objected to the admission was in all probability a not
                    insignificant factor taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal. This is so
                    especially because, as mentioned in <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above, the development of the local Bar (the interests of which is represented
                    by the Law Society) is an important factor in the balance sought at the second
                    stage of the test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, in
                    interpreting the decision in <em>Fortescue QC</em>,
                    consideration must be given to the context in which the relevant legislative
                    framework was enacted. The intention of Parliament in enacting stringent
                    Queen’s Counsel admissibility provisions in the LPA was to prevent abuse
                    by parties seeking to admit Queen’s Counsel for uncomplicated cases as
                    well as to give the Bar time to acquire specialised expertise in advocacy. The
                    intention was <em>not</em> to exclude the services of
                    Queen’s Counsel altogether, or to restrict the admission of Queen’s
                    Counsel to the <em>most complex of cases</em> where there
                    is a <em>total absence</em> of local counsel willing and
                    able to handle the case at hand. This is manifestly evident from a careful
                    perusal of Hansard which, for clarity, I discuss at length in the following
                    sub-paragraphs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prior to the amendments to the LPA
                        in 1991, s 21(1) of the LPA provided that Queen’s Counsel could
                        be admitted on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis where the
                        applicant had “special qualifications or experience for the
                        purpose of the case”. There was no explicit requirement
                        that the case had to be of “sufficient difficulty and
                        complexity”. In the absence of such an explicit requirement, the
                        Minister for Law noted that “the system of admission of QCs has gone
                        in a direction which might have not been intended by the legislature and
                        that they are being admitted for the <em>simple, routine and
                            ordinary cases</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                        (20 March 1990) vol 55 at col 535

                        point:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The specific provision in the Legal Profession Act says that QCs can
                            be admitted on an ad hoc basis where “he has special
                            qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case”. So the
                            legislative policy is very clear. They are obviously to be admitted for
                            cases of complexity or difficulty where the needed skills or experience
                            or the specialist knowledge is not readily available here. To put it in
                            a different way, <em>Parliament never envisaged or
                                contemplated that they should be admitted for </em><em>the </em><em>routine or
                                </em><em>the </em><em>ordinary or </em><em>the </em><em>simple case which can easily be handled by Singapore
                                lawyers</em>. It is for this reason, I believe that the scheme
                            for the provisions of QCs also allows for the Law Society, in addition
                            to the Attorney-General, to specifically put their views on each
                            application of a QC to the court. So if they have objections, they can
                            and should register the objections with the court, because then the
                            court taking note of all views expressed before it can make a
                            decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I too have had feedback from lawyers expressing the same concern of
                            the three colleagues that <em>the </em><em>system of admission of QCs has gone in a direction which
                                might have not been intended by </em><em>the
                                </em><em>legislature and that
                                </em><em>they are being admitted for
                                </em><em>the </em><em>simple, routine and ordinary cases</em>. Such a trend not
                            only was never contemplated or envisaged by Parliament, but I agree with
                            the Members that one unhealthy consequence of this would be that it will
                            stultify the growth of a specialist bar in Singapore. It will impede the
                            growth of a core of good litigation lawyers in Singapore.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Minister for
                        Law also recognised that the continued admission of Queen’s Counsel
                        was necessary in the public interest and national interest, especially given
                        that Singapore was (and is) endeavouring to be a leading financial and
                        commercial centre. See <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                            Official Report</em> (20 March 1990) vol 55 at
                        cols 534–535 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for
                        Law):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is worthwhile recalling that QCs are allowed to come in because we
                            the Government and Parliament specifically have so provided for in the
                            Legal Profession Act. The reason why we allow QCs to come in is really
                            public interest and national interest, ie, <em>it is a
                                recognition of </em><em>the
                                </em><em>fact that </em><em>there are cases or </em><em>there can
                                be cases of such complexity or difficulty that </em><b><em>there may not be the local expertise here or there may not
                                be enough of the local expertise here to provide that kind of skills
                                to handle cases of such complexity and
                                difficulty</em></b><em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If that is the reason why QCs were allowed in and why the Legal
                            Profession Act provided for it, I would say that reason continues to
                            exist. With Singapore trying to be a leading financial and commercial
                            centre, we will have this need for expertise to handle difficult and
                            complex cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is also
                        relevant that the Minister for Law had noted, in his Parliamentary speech,
                        the Malaysian provision for <em>ad hoc</em> admission
                        of Queen’s Counsel. The Malaysian provision expressly provided that a
                        Queen’s Counsel could only be admitted if the applicant had
                        “special qualifications or experience of a nature <em>not available amongst advocates and solicitors in
                        Malaysia</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Singapore
                            Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (20 March 1990)
                        vol 55 at col 536 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)).
                        Had Parliament intended to limit the admission of Queen’s Counsel to
                        cases that <em>absolutely no local counsel</em> could
                        handle, it stands to reason that the relevant admission provision would be
                        phrased in a manner more akin to the Malaysian provision than the present
                        s 15 of the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     It follows from points made above that the requirement of
                        “sufficient difficulty and complexity” was included to prevent
                        the admission of Queen’s Counsel for <em>simple,
                            routine and ordinary cases</em>, rather than to limit admission to
                        cases that <em>absolutely no local counsel</em> could
                        handle. Furthermore, in introducing the requirement of “sufficient
                        difficulty and complexity” into the then s 21 of the Legal
                        Profession Act, the Minister for Law emphasised at the Second Reading of the
                        Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill in 1991 that one of the Government’s
                        policies behind the wording of the then s 21 of the Legal Profession
                        Act was to allow Queen’s Counsel to be admitted for cases involving
                        important sectors of Singapore’s economy (<em>Singapore
                            Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (14 January 1991)
                        vol 56 at cols 798 and 805 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister
                        for Law)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">We have taken some time to craft this amendment because Government
                            considers <em>QCs to perform a useful role in our efforts
                                to be the leading commercial and financial sector</em>. A
                            study done for me by two members of the academic staff of the Faculty of
                            Law of the National University of Singapore on admission of QCs for the
                            period 1985 to 1989 showed that commercial law cases formed the
                            majority, some 60%, of cases where QCs were admitted. <em>It is desirable that they continue to perform this role</em>.
                            Therefore, any amendment which we craft to ensure that there is
                                <em>no abuse</em> and that <em>QCs are not admitted for the very simple, routine or uncomplicated
                                cases, must not shut the door to admission of QCs in those areas
                                where solicitors are especially needed, particularly in banking and
                                commercial law sectors</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Obviously, it will take some time to develop a significant pool of
                            local litigation lawyers who can service the requirements of Singapore
                            as an international financial and commercial centre. When we will
                            achieve that is difficult to predict. In the meantime, however,
                                <em>we should not deprive our financial and
                                commercial centre of the assistance of QCs</em>. <em>The proposed amendment will allow the Courts to continue to
                                liberally admit QCs for the important and complex commercial and
                                banking cases</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Let us not forget that very few countries in the world have a policy
                            of allowing QCs whereby lawyers outside the legal system could come in
                            and practise. We are one of the very few countries and we do it because
                                <em>we consider it is useful in our national
                                interest, particularly in our efforts to develop Singapore as a
                                banking and financial centre</em>. But they must be admitted
                            not for any routine simple case, because we have our own legal
                            profession.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     I acknowledge
                        that in a Parliamentary speech in 1996, the Minister for Law espoused the
                        view that Queen’s Counsel should only be admitted where, <em>inter alia</em>, local counsel is unable or unavailable
                        to provide the necessary knowledge or experience. However, the
                        Minister’s views must be read in the context of the rest of his
                        speech. Indeed, the Minister immediately went on to emphasise the intention
                        to favour the admission of Queen’s Counsel in banking and commercial
                        cases (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                            Report</em> (10 October 1996) vol 66 at col 633
                        (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Sir, the provision relating to the admission of Queen's Counsels was
                            last amended in 1991 to add an additional condition for allowing them to
                            appear in our courts. That condition is that the court must be satisfied
                            that the case is of “sufficient difficulty and complexity”
                            to warrant a QC to be admitted. At that time in this House I had made it
                            clear that the Government's policy was that <em>QCs
                                should only be admitted for complex and difficult cases where the
                                necessary knowledge or experience was not available from or could
                                not be provided by local counsel</em>. I also stressed then
                            that the intention was to <em>favour the admission of QCs
                                particularly in banking and commercial cases</em>. [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In view of the clear Parliamentary intention,
                    I did not think that the Court of Appeal in <em>Fortescue QC</em> can or should be interpreted literally to have
                    laid down a stringent rule of law denying the admission of Queen’s Counsel
                    except where “no local counsel was able and willing to take the
                    case” (<em>Fortescue</em> at [15]). In any case, the statement just quoted
                    is strictly speaking <em>obiter dicta</em>. Finally,
                        <em>I am also minded to observe that such a requirement would
                        be rather impractical as it would require the party seeking the admission of
                        Queen’s Counsel to have been declined representation by each and every
                        single Senior Counsel in Singapore (regardless of his or her expertise)
                        before leave for admission might be allowed.</em> I do not think that
                    it can be inferred from the history of the relevant statutory scheme that such
                    an onerous entry barrier had ever been contemplated by Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the light of the above, I did not accept
                    the following arguments from the Respondent contending that this court should
                    not exercise its discretion to admit the Applicant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>First, the
                            Respondent claimed that WongPartnership LLP is sufficiently
                            familiar with the Arbitration to conduct the hearing without the
                            Applicant.</em> However, while WongPartnership LLP was involved in
                        the Arbitration, it should be highlighted that the Applicant was the overall
                        lead counsel taking charge of all aspects of the matter. He conducted all
                        oral arguments on behalf of the Plaintiffs in the Arbitration,
                        cross-examined the witnesses in the Arbitration, prepared the written
                        submission and reviewed the voluminous evidence. Although the Respondent
                        rightly pointed out that the lawyers from WongPartnership LLP were present
                        at the Arbitration hearings, it is undeniable that the Applicant would be
                        much better placed to address the court in the legal issues that arise here
                        in light of his familiarity with the complex issues involved, his legal
                        expertise in the field of international arbitration as well as his advocacy
                        skills and his not inconsequential ability to elucidate on the current(and
                        perhaps desirable) legal position on these issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Second, the
                            Respondent suggested that the Plaintiffs could obtain the services of
                            Senior Counsel (including, but not limited to, the four Senior Counsel
                            in WongPartnership LLP)</em>. However, as I have pointed out
                        earlier, I do not think that there is an iron rule of law that the
                        availability and ability of local counsel is <em>per
                            se</em> an absolute bar to admission of a Queen’s Counsel.
                        Indeed, I noted that courts have even gone on to state that there is no
                        general rule that prohibits a litigant from engaging <em>both</em> a Queen’s Counsel and a local Senior Counsel to
                        argue his case if the circumstances of the case justify such admission
                            (<em>Beloff QC</em> at [13]). It should be noted that in
                            <em>Beloff QC</em>, a Queen’s Counsel
                        was admitted even though the party was already represented by a local Senior
                        Counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Returning to the facts of the present case, I
                    had earlier mentioned (at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>) that the
                    legal and factual issues were sufficiently difficult and complex to satisfy the
                    statutory litmus test. In assessing whether this court should exercise its
                    discretion to allow the Applicant’s application for admission, I was of
                    the view that there are a number of factors that clearly favour the admission of
                    the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, and quite notably, this appears to be
                    the first instance where the lead counsel in prior arbitration proceedings is
                    applying for <em>ad hoc</em> admission to appear in a
                    Singapore court on matters immediately arising from the very same arbitration
                    proceedings. Although <em>Price QC</em> dealt with an
                    application to admit Mr Arthur Leolin Price QC to represent the
                    appellant in an application for leave to appeal from an interim award made in an
                    arbitration proceeding, Mr Price QC was not the lead counsel in the
                    prior arbitration proceedings. <em>Price QC</em> at
                        [10] also involved a premature
                    application and the Court of Appeal felt that the application should have only
                    been made <em>after</em> the application for leave to
                    appeal from the arbitration award had been decided in favour of granting leave.
                    Furthermore, the application was only for admission to argue leave to appeal and
                    not the actual appeal proceedings itself, thus the legal issues in <em>Price QC</em> were plainly not of a “sufficient
                    difficulty or complexity”. In contrast, the proceedings in RA 278,
                    RA 279, SUM 4064 and SUM 4065 concern the sequel to arbitration
                    proceedings, that has singular significance for the parties – that is to
                    say, the recovery of the fruits of the Awards. I was of the view that this area
                    of international arbitration is indeed a complex area of law which justified the
                    admission of Queen’s Counsel in this case. <em>It is
                        undisputed that the Applicant was the Plaintiffs’ lead counsel
                        throughout the lengthy and complex Arbitration and has intimate knowledge of
                        what has transpired. It is significant that the legal issues to be canvassed
                        in the High Court are inextricably linked to the arbitration proceedings
                        where he had made extensive and substantive submissions on issues which will
                        inevitably arise again in RA 278, RA 279, SUM 4064 and
                        SUM 4065.</em> Counsel for the Applicant quite rightly pointed
                    out that Issue 2 had already been fully canvassed before the Tribunal by
                    the Applicant himself and he would be best placed to assist in addressing any of
                    the court’s queries in relation to the Tribunal’s decision on this
                    issue. It is also undisputed that the Applicant presently oversees all matters
                    in <em>all jurisdictions</em> pertaining to underlying
                    dispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants and the enforcement of the
                    Awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Second, the Applicant has special expertise in
                    respect of the issues that arise in RA 278, RA 279, SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065. Over and above his undoubted familiarity with the facts and legal
                    issues involved in the case (see above at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>), the qualifications of the Applicant in the field of
                    international arbitration are also unquestioned by all parties to this
                    Application. That is neither a surprising nor a charitable concession on the
                    part of the Respondent. The Applicant has been consistently acknowledged by
                    established international legal directories and legal practice references as a
                    leading Queen’s Counsel in the field of international arbitration.
                    Further, he appears particularly suited to address the issues arising in this
                    case (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) because he is the
                    author of <em>Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements and their
                        Enforcement</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2005) and (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2nd Ed, 2010), which is now widely considered to be a leading reference
                    text in the complex field of arbitration law. This book has also been referred
                    to by the Singapore courts as an authority for various legal propositions or
                    views: see <em>Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete
                        Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 at [38], <em>The
                        “Duden”</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 984 at [11], <em>Insigma Technology Co
                        Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 23 at
                        [21], <em>Insigma
                        Technology Co Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 936 at [33] and
                        <em>CRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero)
                        TBK</em> [2011] SGCA 33 at [36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Third, it should be pointed out that there is
                    neither evidence nor contention that the Applicant will be any less than
                    “responsible, honourable, courteous and respectful of our
                    Judiciary” (see <em>Littlemore QC</em> at [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Fourth, the Respondent argued that the
                    admission of the Applicant would result in prejudice to the Respondent because
                    there would be “further delay”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> in the hearing of RA 278,
                    RA 279, SUM 4064 and SUM 4065, and furthermore delays may
                    adversely impact on garnishee proceedings that were to take place in Hong Kong.
                    In my view, the Respondent’s contention that the Applicant’s
                    availability (or lack thereof) may result in further delay was entirely
                    speculative – there is presently no hearing date fixed for RA 278,
                    RA 279, SUM 4064 and SUM 4065. In any case, I note that in
                        <em>Beloff QC</em>, Yong CJ noted that a delay of
                    three months pursuant to the admission of a Queen’s Counsel was not of
                    such magnitude that substantial injustice would be caused. I also think that the
                    existence of pending Hong Kong garnishee proceedings provides <em>even greater reason</em> that a Singapore court, as the supervisory
                    court, should set well-considered directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Finally, I noted that in the present case (and
                    unlike in <em>Fortescue QC</em>), <em>both</em> the Attorney-General and the Law Society, as objective
                    non-parties to the proceedings in RA 278, RA 279, SUM 4064 and
                    SUM 4065, supported the application for the Applicant’s admission.
                    Indeed, the strong support of the Attorney-General is evident from the written
                    submissions tendered, where it was stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Attorney-General] does not see any reason, from the point of view of
                        the Public Interest, to object to the Applicant being admitted on an
                            a<em>d hoc basis</em> for <em>the</em> forthcoming hearing. Indeed, <em>admitting the Applicant for this purpose will be consistent with the
                            many amendments that have been made to our laws in order to enhance the
                            attractiveness of Singapore as a venue for international commercial
                            arbitrations</em>. It is an assurance to Parties who arbitrate in
                        Singapore that their lead counsel in the arbitration proceeding can,
                        provided he has sufficient expertise and experience to assist a Singapore
                        Court, appear on their behalf when the same matter or matters arising
                        therefrom is subsequently considered by a Court in Singapore. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It was earlier noted (at [50(d)] and [50(e)]
                    above) that the legislative intent was for courts to “continue to
                        <em>liberally</em> admit QCs for the important and
                        <em>complex commercial</em> and banking cases”
                    [emphasis added], and to “<em>favour</em> the
                    admission of QCs <em>particularly</em> in banking and
                        <em>commercial cases</em>” [emphasis added]. In
                    this regard, the Minister for Law has recently emphasised that Singapore is
                    presently the leading regional arbitration hub, with a commitment to
                    “update our laws to reflect best practices” and to ensure that
                        “<em>[i]nternational best practices are adopted and
                        investors as well as lawyers who advise them can easily understand our
                        system, and work within it</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (9 March 2011) vol 87 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). Even more
                    recently, the Minister for Law emphasised the need to “continue to
                    promote Singapore as a venue of choice for international dispute resolution
                    … [and] that the arbitration infrastructure in Singapore … remains
                    world-class, is continually improved and keeps ahead of international
                    developments” (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (10 October 2011) vol 88 at col 71
                    (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). In view of the strong emphasis on
                    developing international arbitration law in Singapore, it would be very much in
                    line with the wider public interests to admit the Applicant in relation to the
                    pending matters before the High Court. It must, however, be stressed that this
                    does not mean that in future every application involving the same Queen’s
                    Counsel who has been the lead counsel in the arbitration proceedings below will
                    be favourably viewed. Not only must the legal issues be of sufficient difficulty
                    and complexity, the Court must also be convinced that the issues argued are
                    inextricably linked to the arbitration proceedings and that there will be a real
                    benefit in having the same counsel assist the Court. A matter centric approach
                    that pays particular attention to the sufficiency of complexity and difficulty
                    of the issues raised will have to be adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     My decision to admit the Applicant was
                    premised on the rather special and compelling facts of this matter that have
                    been elaborated upon earlier (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>–<a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>).The pending
                    proceedings are an intricately tangled sequel to an international arbitration
                    involving two well established foreign commercial conglomerates. That
                    arbitration had Singapore as its seat. Apart from the international dimension of
                    the underlying dispute and the large financial stakes the parties have in the
                    outcome of the pending proceedings, the potentially multi-jurisdictional
                    implications that any determination of the Singapore courts might have, had also
                    to be considered. I saw absolutely no reason why in such a matter, which plainly
                    ticks off all the statutory admission requirements, the application should not
                    be acceded to. This decision, however, ought not to be interpreted as signalling
                    that the Court is presently disposed to liberally reinterpret the existing
                    statutory constrictions governing the <em>ad hoc</em>
                    admission of Queen’s Counsel. This would not be permissible as case law
                    emanating from the Court of Appeal has authoritatively determined that <em>ad hoc</em> admissions in ordinary circumstances under the
                    current legislative architecture will be rare. The fact that no Queen’s
                    Counsel has been permitted to appear here since leave was granted in Originating
                    Motion No 38 of 2004, some seven years ago, says it all. Given the settled
                    nature of such caselaw and its provenance, legislative intervention will be
                    necessary should it now be considered that the public interests require a
                    reappraisal of the current tightly restricted position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     This matter has a fearsomely convoluted
                    history that cannot be simply painted onto a legal canvas with a few brush
                    strokes. The Applicant’s intimate and singular knowledge of the
                    Arbitration (with all its factual complexities and legal creases) and his
                    peculiar expertise in the area of international arbitration law and practice
                    would allow him to illuminate “the true shades of the law and
                    fact” (<em>Re Gyles QC</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 871 at [5]).
                    Pertinently, neither the Attorney-General (representing the Public Interest) nor
                    the Law Society (representing <em>the in</em>terests of the
                    Bar) objected to the application. In the final analysis, bearing in mind that
                    several of the legal issues that will ar<em>ise in</em> the
                    pending proceedings are still being animatedly debated within the wider arbitral
                    community and remain unsettled in most jurisdictions, the circumstances of this
                    case plainly warranted the exercise of discretion in favour of admission of the
                    Applicant. I accordingly allowed the application with no order as to
                    costs.</p>
