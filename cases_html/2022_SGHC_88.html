The Appellant was babysitting each of them in her home at the material time. She was sentenced to three and a half years of imprisonment for each offence, and this was ordered to run consecutively, giving a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. She presently appeals against her conviction and sentence. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">3 In arriving at his decision to convict the Appellant of the charges, however, the trial Judge (“the Judge”) relied on the fact that a toxicology report (“the Report”) in respect of blood and urine samples collected from the Appellant showed all of the drugs that were found in the blood of BB1.

The Appellant’s evidence is that she made a police report asserting that she was the victim of a sexual assault, and had allowed those medical tests to take place as part of her cooperation with investigations.

In the present case, however, any exclusion of the Report from consideration would not in any event have affected the correctness of the Appellant’s conviction on the Charges. I further find that there is no basis for the Appellant’s appeal against sentence. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal in its entirety. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Appellant has a diploma in Nursing and has been enrolled as a nurse with the Singapore Nursing Board since 2002. She was a freelance nurse at the material time and advertised her babysitting services on the Internet sometime in 2016, stating therein that she was a nurse. She resided in an apartment in Hougang with her two teenage daughters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Sometime in October 2016, the mother of BB1 (“M1”) was looking for babysitting services for her children, and was contacted by the Appellant. M1 started sending over BB1 and her elder daughter of five years old to the Appellant’s home for babysitting sometime in early November 2016. Generally, she would send them over at around 7.30am and pick them up at around 6pm later that day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Appellant babysat BB1 and her sister on eight occasions between 7 November and 9 December 2016. The Appellant was the primary caregiver to BB1 during these times and would feed her, including personally preparing her milk. This was save for one occasion where one of the Appellant’s daughters did so. It was agreed that the Appellant’s daughters did not administer any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to BB1 during these babysitting sessions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 22 November 2016, M1 brought BB1 to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”) for a check-up, as she noticed that BB1 was behaving unusually. KKH took a blood sample from BB1 and subsequently discharged her as nothing unusual was found. The blood test did not check for any medication or drugs in BB1’s blood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 9 December 2016, after picking BB1 up from the Appellant’s home, M1 noticed that BB1 was unnaturally drowsy. She brought BB1 to Parkway East Hospital (“PEH”), whereupon BB1 was admitted. A medical memo dated 16 February 2017 stated that she was found to be drowsy, floppy and unable to follow objects. A blood sample taken from BB1 on 9 December 2016 was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 12 December 2016, and was found to contain the following substances: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Alprazolam – 0.37ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Chlorpheniramine – 0.14ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) (Dextro)methorphan – 0.19ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Diazepam – 0.28ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Nordiazepam – 0.90ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) Orphenadrine – 0.10ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) Oxazepam – 0.13ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(h) (Pseudo)ephedrine – 2.3ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(i) Temazepam – 0.10ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(j) Triprolidine – 0.05ug/ml; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(k) Zolpidem – 0.96ug/ml.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 BB1 responded well to treatment and was subsequently discharged on 13 December 2016. She was found to be well at a review on 17 December 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As for BB2, sometime in December 2016, her mother (“M2”) posted in a Facebook group called “Mummy’s Group” that she needed someone to look after BB2 on the night of 25 December 2016. The Appellant responded to this message, and it was agreed that M2 would send BB2 to the Appellant’s home for babysitting. M2 subsequently sent BB2 to the Appellant’s home on the said night. Other than the Appellant and her daughters, Dr Peter Looi (“Dr Looi”) was also present in her home. However, he was not involved in BB2’s care. As with the charge involving BB1, it was agreed that the Appellant’s daughters did not administer any poisons or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drugs to BB2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 26 December 2016, sometime between 6.30am and 7.30am, BB2’s father (“F2”) picked BB2 up from the Appellant’s home. M2 sent BB2 to KKH at around 5pm on the same day. BB2 was observed to be drowsy with ptosis (droopy eyelids), truncal ataxia (inability to sit upright and/or stand without support) and had difficulty walking, and was admitted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 A urine sample taken from BB2 on 28 December 2016 was sent to the HSA for analysis the following day. The following substances were detected in the urine sample: hydroxyalprazolam, alprazolam, chlorpheniramine, diazepam, ephedrine, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. A blood sample taken from BB2 on 29 December 2016 was also sent to the HSA for analysis on the same day, and was found to contain the following substances:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Diazepam – 0.33ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Nordiazepam – 1.3ug/ml;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Oxazepam – 0.17ug/ml; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Temazepam – 0.08ug/ml.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15  BB2 responded well to physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and was discharged on 1 January 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 29 December 2016, the police seized the following items from the Appellant’s home: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) One empty slab of zolpidem (trade name “Stilnox”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) One slab of chlorpheniramine (trade name “Piriton”) with ten tablets; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) A handkerchief with brown stains, on which diazepam was detected after testing; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) A milk bottle, on which zolpidem was detected after testing.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It was also agreed that in November and December 2016, the Appellant was prescribed, among other things, “Stilnox” (zolpidem), “Xanax” (alprazolam) and diazepam by Everhealth Medical Centre.

</div> It was argued that she administered the drugs to the Victims. The Victims’ mothers had consistently testified that their babies were normal when they were brought over to the Appellant’s home, but unusually drowsy when picked up, and their testimony was corroborated by their messages to the Appellant as well as the fact that they brought the Victims to the hospital to be examined. The poisons were also found in the Victims’ blood samples shortly after they had left the care of the Appellant. The Appellant did not moreover have a satisfactory explanation for the milk bottle with traces of zolpidem which was found in her home. It was argued that the Appellant, being an enrolled nurse and being fully aware of the dangers of administering non-prescribed medication to babies, clearly intended to cause hurt to the Victims by so administering the poisons to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 With regard to sentence, the Prosecution highlighted the vulnerability of the Victims, and the testimony of Dr Juliet Tan (“Dr Tan”) and Dr Koh Ai Ling (“Dr Koh”), Registrars at the Department of Paediatrics in KKH who had prepared medical reports for BB2, that it would be unsafe to administer the drugs that were found in the Victims without close monitoring.

It was undisputed that she had access to these drugs in 2016, and the claim that she could have involuntarily consumed them was a “preposterous one” being raised for the first time on appeal. Indeed, she had agreed in cross-examination that she had consumed all the medication which was found in her body pursuant to the Report.

</div> The Appellant had in fact informed the police that she crushed half a tablet of “Piriton” (chlorpheniramine), mixed it with water and fed it to BB1. The Prosecution submits that although the scientific evidence cannot precisely pinpoint the exact time at which the drugs were administered, that evidence together with the presentation of the Victims’ symptoms sufficiently enabled the Judge to correctly triangulate the time period in which this likely occurred.

It was best for parties to be invited to ventilate possible arguments.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Having considered the arguments made before me, I have concluded that the use of the Report is proper as:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It is relevant and admissible as evidence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is no bar to its use either on the basis of</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The privilege against self-incrimination; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The rule against similar fact evidence; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is nothing to attract the exercise of the Court’s discretion against its use in the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">In addition, I am satisfied that there is no separate right of privacy or confidentiality relating to a person’s body that would need to be vindicated in this context. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Relevance and admissibility</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I agree with the Prosecution that the Report is relevant and admissible under several of the general categories of relevant facts under the EA. Its admissibility is also supported by s 263 of the CPC 2012, which provides that the reports of certain qualified persons on any matter or thing duly submitted to them for analysis are admissible as evidence of the facts stated therein “in any criminal proceeding under this Code”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Prosecution argues that the fact of the Appellant’s access to the drugs in September 2016, when the Report was made, is a relevant fact under, amongst others, ss 7, 9 and 11 of the EA.

Significantly, the phrase “any criminal proceeding under this Code” does not appear to require that the subject report is only admitted in proceedings that it was sought in contemplation of. It has been held that the phrase does not refer to judicial proceedings only and that “if such a report is made in any kind of proceeding under the Code…that can be used as evidence in any enquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code” (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahiman v The State of Mysore </span>(1972) CriLJ 406 at [9], on s 510 of the Indian CPC 1898). It is noted that s 510 of the Indian CPC 1898 was intended to save the then-small number of government experts, whose evidence was frequently needed in the criminal courts, the need of appearing in Court (Law Commission of India, 41st Report (The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898), September 1969 at para 41.1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As such, I agree with the Prosecution that the Report was “properly obtained through the exercise of the police’s investigative powers”.

It is also significant that in the present case, the maker of the Report did provide oral evidence and was cross-examined by the Defence on the Report.

</div> This reflects the fact that the Prosecution acts “at all times in the public interest” (<span class="font-italic">Nabill </span>at [37]). However, it does not necessarily follow that the Report falls under the “fruits of investigations” which are to be disclosed to ensure that justice is done (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [200]). Rather, the notion of “fruits of investigations” in <span class="font-italic">R v Stinchcombe </span>[1991] 3 SCR 326 (“<span class="font-italic">Stinchcombe</span>”), which was cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>(at [90] and [200]), was concerned with the Crown’s obligation to disclose to the Defence statements by a witness who had earlier given evidence at a preliminary inquiry that was favourable to the accused. It was in that context that the Supreme Court of Canada observed that “the fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of counsel for the Crown are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done. In contrast, the [D]efence has no obligation to assist the [P]rosecution and is entitled to assume a purely adversarial role towards the [P]rosecution” (at [11]–[12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The subject matter of required disclosure by the Prosecution under <span class="font-italic">Stinchcombe </span>is therefore described as “fruits of the investigation”, since it likely includes (<span class="font-italic">R v Gubbins </span>[2018] 3 SCR 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Gubbins</span>”) at [22], citing <span class="font-italic">R v Jackson </span>(2015) ONCA 832 at [92]–[93]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Relevant, non-privileged information related to the matters the Crown intends to adduce in evidence against an accused, as well as any information in respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it may assist an accused in the exercise of the right to make full answer and defence. The information may relate to the unfolding of the narrative of material events, to the credibility of witnesses or the reliability of evidence that may form part of the case to meet.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In its normal, natural everyday sense, the phrase “fruits of the investigation” posits a relationship between the subject matter sought and the investigation that leads to the charges against an accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">Gubbins</span>, the “fruits of investigation” refers to the police’s investigative files, as opposed to operational records of background information, and is information “generated or acquired during or as a result of the specific investigation into the charges against the accused” (at [22]). As such, it is not immediately obvious that it should encompass information generated pursuant to a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> investigation commenced by an accused person. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Privilege against self-incrimination </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Appellant also argues that the admission of the Report violates the privilege against self-incrimination. The privilege has been stated as expressing the rule that “no one is bound to answer any question if the answer thereto would, in the opinion of the judge, have a tendency to expose the deponent to any criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture which the judge regards as reasonably likely to be preferred or sued for” (<span class="font-italic">Blunt v Park Lane Hotel </span>[1942] 2 KB 253 at 257, cited in <span class="font-italic">AT &amp; T Istel v Tully </span>[1993] 1 AC 45 at 67). It is part of the broader right to silence, which in turn “does not denote any single right, but rather refers to a disparate group of immunities” including, amongst others, a general immunity, possessed by all persons and bodies, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions posed by other persons or bodies; or being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions the answers to which may incriminate them (<span class="font-italic">R v Director of Serious Frauds Office, ex p Smith </span>[1993] AC 1 at 30–31). The privilege can cover “any piece of information or evidence on which the prosecution might wish to rely in establishing guilt”, including in deciding whether or not to prosecute a person (<span class="font-italic">Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos and another </span>[1999] QB 271 at 289). It is noted that privilege prevents the production of evidence and does not affect its admissibility in evidence once produced, which depends on its relevance (<span class="font-italic">R v George Edward Tompkins </span>(1977) 67 Cr App R 181 at 184; <span class="font-italic">R v Governor of Pentonville Prison ex p Osman </span>[1990] 1 WLR 277 at 310). What evidence is relevant is in turn defined by the EA (<span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 110 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As noted by the parties, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span> that the right to silence is not a fundamental principle of natural justice which is included in the word “law” in Art 9(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed) (which in turn provides that “[n]o person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law”; at [15]). According to the Court, to recognise it as a constitutional right “would be to elevate an evidential rule to constitutional status”, even though it was not explicitly expressed in the Constitution (at [15]). There was “no specific constitutional or statutory provision protecting such a ‘right [to silence]’ or such a ‘privilege [against self-incrimination]’)” (at [13]). In fact, other provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC 1985”) which expressly derogated from such a right, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ss 122(6) and 123(1) of the CPC 1985 (predecessors to ss 23(1) and 261(1) of the CPC 2012), had been upheld as valid and constitutional (at [18]–[19]). It is noted that the Court of Appeal appeared to treat the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination as co-extensive although, as discussed, they are not: the privilege protects the right of witnesses not to incriminate themselves, not their right to remain silent (see Queensland Law Reform Commission, <span class="font-italic">The Abrogation of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination </span>(Report No 59) (December 2004) at para 1.4). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the face of the clear words in <span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span>, it does not seem open to the Appellant to argue that the privilege against self-incrimination may constitute part of the fundamental rules of natural justice incorporated into ‘law’ for the purposes of Art 9(1) of the Constitution (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with the effect that any deprivations to life or personal liberty must be in accordance with it).

</div> I also do not think the Appellant is correct to argue that the privilege against self-incrimination is, at least in Singapore, part of the fair hearing rule that was observed to be applicable in both the administrative and constitutional contexts in <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1189 at [105]. As set out by Warren Khoo J in <span class="font-italic">Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd v Minister for Manpower (formerly known as Minister for Labour) </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 866 at [26], the fair hearing rule requires: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… firstly, that a party is told of the case he has to meet and of the allegations made against him; secondly, that he is given not only a fair opportunity to put his own case, but also a fair opportunity to correct or contradict the case and the allegations of the other party; thirdly, if a significant point is to be taken against him by the tribunal, he should have a similar opportunity.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is quite separate from the privilege against self-incrimination as described above, and the Appellant has not shown how the privilege can be a “bedrock” for the conduct of a fair hearing.

</div> Although the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights has held that the privilege lies “at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure” under Art 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights on the right to a fair trial despite it not being specifically mentioned therein (<span class="font-italic">John Murray v United Kingdom </span>(1996) 22 EHRR 29<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45]; <span class="font-italic">Bykov v Russia </span>[2009] ECHR 441 at [92]), those observations were made in a different statutory context and cannot apply here in light of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Additionally, although s 22(2) of the CPC 2012 does statutorily express the privilege against self-incrimination, I agree with the Prosecution that it does not apply to the present case.

</div>
</div> Section 22(1) of the CPC 2012 provides that a police officer “may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with any of the facts and circumstances of the case”, while s 22(2) states that the person examined by the police is “bound to state truly what he knows about the facts and circumstances of the case, except that he need not say anything that might expose him to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”. Section 22(2) of the CPC 2012 thus permits the person being questioned to maintain his silence on matters that may be personally incriminating (<span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 at [17]–[18]) and to that extent preserves the privilege against self-incrimination for that person (Michael Hor, “The Privilege against Self-Incrimination and Fairness to the Accused” (1993) SJLS 35 at<br/>p 38; Ho Hock Lai, “The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination and Right of Access to a Lawyer” (2013) 25 SAcLJ 826 at [6]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, s 22(2) of the CPC 2012 relates to the oral examination of a witness, as indicated by ss 22(1) and 22(3)–(7), the latter of which provisions contemplate the reduction of that examination into writing. This is also the case in India, where it has been held that statements reduced into writing pursuant to the equivalent of s 22(3) (s 161(3) of the Indian CPC 1973) refers to “all that is stated by a witness to a police officer or officers during the course of investigation” (<span class="font-italic">Asan Tharayil Baby v State of Kerala </span>(1981) CrLJ 1165 at [13]. On the other hand, the report of the Chemical Examiner on the examination of blood of an accused person did not appear to be the subject to the statutory limitations on such statements (see <span class="font-italic">Ukla Kohle v State of Maharashtra</span> (1963) AIR 1531). It therefore seems to me that s 22(2) of the CPC cannot be taken to represent a privilege of self-incrimination as regards the Report. This is also consistent with the fact that the common law privilege does not exclude real evidence, as I turn now to discuss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55  The Appellant faces at least three difficulties in any assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination at common law in my view. First, the privilege does not appear to cover non-testimonial evidence such as her blood and urine samples and the consequent Report. Second and more fundamentally, the privilege does not cover instances where there was a lack of compulsion to provide the evidence in question. Third, it would seem that she has lost any such privilege by reason of not claiming it in the proceedings below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On the first, the privilege does not cover real evidence such as her samples. In the UK, it was held that the privilege, being primarily concerned with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent, does not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material that may have been obtained compulsorily from the accused but which have an “existence independent of [his] will … such as, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, documents acquired pursuant to a warrant, breath, blood and urine samples and bodily tissue for the purpose of DNA testing” (<span class="font-italic">Attorney-General’s Reference (No 7 of 2000) </span>[2001] WLR 1879 at [34], citing <span class="font-italic">Saunders v United Kingdom </span>(1996) 23 EHRR 313 at [69]; see also <span class="font-italic">George v Coombe </span>[1978] Crim LR 47 and <span class="font-italic">R v Kearns </span>[2002] 1 WLR 2815 at [53(4)]). This is similarly the case in Australia (<span class="font-italic">Sorby and another v Commonwealth of Australia and others </span>(1983) 46 ALR 237 at 243 to 244). As discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">R v Stillman </span>[1997] 1 SCR 607:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[206] That great chronicler of the common law of evidence, Wigmore, offers a detailed discussion of the fundamental distinction that the common law drew between compelled testimonial evidence and compelled real evidence. He begins by asking the question which occupies us at this point:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Does [the privilege] apply only (1) to self-incriminating disclosures which are <span class="font-italic">testimonial </span>(i.e., communicative, or assertive) in nature? Or (2) to self-incriminating disclosures which, whether or not testimonial, involved <span class="font-italic">cooperative participation </span>by the witness: Or (3) to <span class="font-italic">all evidence obtained from a witness, </span>which incriminates him, whether or not his cooperation is involved? [Emphasis in original.] (<span class="font-italic">Wigmore on Evidence</span>, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), §2263, at p. 378). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">He concludes that the answer is the first; the privilege against self-incrimination is confined to testimonial disclosures …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The history of the privilege …</span> – <span class="font-italic">especially the spirit of the struggle by which its establishment came about </span>– <span class="font-italic">suggests that the privilege is limited to testimonial disclosures. It was directed at the employment of legal process to extract from the person’s own lips an admission of guilt, which would thus take the place of other evidence. That is, it was intended to prevent the use of legal compulsion to extract from the person a sworn communication of his knowledge of facts which would incriminate him. </span>Such was the process of the ecclesiastical court, as opposed through two centuries – the inquisitorial method of putting the accused upon his oath in order to supply the lack of the required two witnesses. Such was the complaint of Lilburn and his fellow objectors, that he ought to be convicted by other evidence and not by his own forced confession upon oath.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Such, too, is the main thrust of the <span class="font-italic">policies </span>of the privilege. … While the policies admittedly apply to some extent to nontestimonial cooperation, it is in testimonial disclosures only that the oath and private thoughts and beliefs of the individual – and therefore the fundamental sentiments supporting the privilege – are involved.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In other words, <span class="font-underline">it is not merely any and every </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">compulsion </span><span class="font-underline">that is the kernel of the privilege, in history and in the constitutional definitions, but </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">testimonial </span><span class="font-underline">compulsion.

Wigmore acknowledges that the remaining categories are more difficult to analyse since they demand the co-operation of the accused person. However, he concludes that they nevertheless do not engage the privilege against self-incrimination because they generally do not compel communication. The 11 categories are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Routine fingerprinting, photographing or measuring of a suspect.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Imprinting of other portions of a suspect’s body (e.g. foot in mud, nose and cheek on window) for the purposes of identification.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Extraction of substance from inside the body of a suspect for purposes of analysis and use in evidence …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(11) Requiring a suspect to submit to the use of the truth serum or the lie detector. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court therefore held that the privilege against self-incrimination was to be confined to testimonial evidence and not real evidence which, in that case, consisted of hair samples, buccal swabs and teeth impressions which were taken from the accused without consent while he was in custody. Such real evidence would instead generally fall to be treated under the search and seizure guarantee under s 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“the Charter”) (which provides that “everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Such a constitutional right could potentially have been relevant if recognised here. The present case is somewhat akin to <span class="font-italic">R v Cole </span>[2012] 3 SCR 34, where school officials had voluntarily provided to the police an employee’s laptop containing child pornography, which had been obtained by the school technician in the context of routine maintenance activities. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the police infringed the accused’s rights under s 8 of the Charter, since the fact that the laptop had been lawfully acquired by the school board for its own administrative purposes did not vest in the police a delegated or derivative power to use it for a criminal investigation (at [67]). The majority was however of the view that the unconstitutionally obtained evidence should not be excluded under s 24(2) of the Charter as its admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. A similar concern has been recently expressed in the United States: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “Police to stop using rape victims’ DNA to investigate crimes”, <span class="font-italic">Associated Press </span>(24 February 2022) and Azi Paybarah, “Victim’s Rape Kit Was Used to Identify Her as a Suspect in another Case”, <span class="font-italic">The New York Times </span>(15 February 2022), citing the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. However, given the absence of a similar right recognised here, the preferable approach to determining whether the Report should be excluded rests on the residual discretion at common law to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value, as discussed below (at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Second, I agree with the Prosecution that the Appellant faces the further difficulty that she was not compelled to provide her blood and urine samples for analysis, or agree to the admission of the Report into evidence. This follows from the above definition of the privilege in [50] and [56], <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the privilege not to be compelled to give evidence against oneself, or <span class="font-italic">nemo tenetur prodere seipsum </span>(‘no one is bound to betray oneself’) (RH Helmholz, “Origins of the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: The Role of the European <span class="font-italic">Ius Commune</span>” (1990) 65 <span class="font-italic">New York University Law Review </span>962 at p 962). It is also confirmed by the statutory preservation of the principle in various jurisdictions. For example, s 10(1) of the Evidence Act 1977 (Qld) provides that “nothing in this Act shall render any person compellable to answer any question tending to criminate the person”. In relation to civil proceedings in the UK, s 14(1) of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 (UK) provides for the “right of a person … to refuse to answer any question or produce any document or thing if to do so would tend to expose that person to proceedings for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty”. Furthermore, s 60 of the Evidence Act 2006 (NZ) provides for the application of the privilege where a person is “required to provide specific information” and that information would be likely to incriminate him for an offence, “self-incrimination” being defined in s 4 as “the provision by a person of information that could reasonably lead to, or increase the likelihood of, the prosecution of that person for a criminal offence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Third, it seems that by not previously asserting any such privilege, it has been lost. As stated by Lindsay J in <span class="font-italic">O Ltd v Z </span>[2005] EWHC 238 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">O Ltd</span>”) (at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The privilege can also be lost simply by reason of its not being claimed. There is – somehow harsh as it may seem on some sets of facts – no willingness in the courts to inquire into whether, had he known of it, a person might have asserted it. That, it has been held, would be to “involve a plain rule in endless confusion” and:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“Their Lordships see no reason to introduce, with reference to this subject, an exception to the rule, recognised as essential to the administration of the Criminal Law, Ignorantia juris non excusat”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">see <span class="font-italic">Queen v Edward Coote </span>(1873) 4 JCPC 599 at 607–608; see also <span class="font-italic">R v Clyne </span>[1985] 2 NSWLR 740 at 746, 747. The textbooks are of the same view; <span class="font-italic">McNicol on the Law of Privilege</span>, 1982 says at p 180 …: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“At common law if the witness has not claimed the privilege (and presumably the Judge has not warned the witness of his right) the witness has no alternative but to suffer the consequences; no retrospectivity of protection is available.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">O Ltd</span>, where the defendant had provided computer and other recorded material to a computer expert engaged by the claimant, pursuant to a search order on which paedophile pornography of a serious nature was found, the expert invited the Court to grant permission for those materials to be handed to the police. Although the defendant later indicated that he wished to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, Lindsay J held that the privilege had been lost on an objective view of his behaviour; he had handed the offensive material to the expert without claiming the privilege (at [70]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">R v Clyne </span>[1985] 2 NSWLR 740, where the Appellant had made admissions in his oral evidence in proceedings where he had disputed a bankruptcy notice, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that he could not challenge the admission of such evidence when he was subsequently charged with giving a false statement to an officer of the Reserve Bank of Australia under certain banking regulations. The Court observed (at p 747), citing the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">R v Coote </span>(1873) LR 4 PC 599, that evidence given by a witness is ordinarily admissible even if it may be incriminating, unless he has already claimed the privilege of self-incrimination and been denied it by the presiding Judge. It added that the mere fact that a witness on the stand is “ordinarily obliged to answer questions does not of itself make those answers involuntary in the sense that it is relevant if those answers are later sought to be used against the witness in criminal proceedings” (at 747). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Given therefore that counsel for the Appellant had not previously objected to the admission of the Report,

</div> However, I agree with the Prosecution that <span class="font-italic">Wong Kim Poh </span>does not assist her. There, the accused who had been charged with murder had made several statements under s 121 of the CPC 1985 which were admitted under s 122(5). His confession that he had stabbed the deceased was contained in only the last paragraph of the statements, while the 16 preceding paragraphs showed that prior to the killing, he was a pimp and had lived on the immoral earnings of his girlfriend. After holding that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, there was no basis to suggest that the trial judges had been adversely influenced by these statements concerning the character of the accused, Yong CJ opined that the preceding paragraphs of the statements (at [15]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">were concerned with the past activities of the appellant and had nothing whatsoever to do with the offence for which he was charged.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I agree with the Prosecution that the Report does not fall foul of the rule against similar fact evidence. Such evidence relates to circumstances in which an accused person acts on occasions other than the one which gave rise to the charged offence, which is sought to be admitted to prove the guilt of the accused (Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence</span> at para 3.001). It consists of conduct that is not specifically connected with the facts in issue (which falls under ss 6–10 of the EA, being illustrations of “different instances of the connection between cause and effect which occur most frequently in judicial proceedings”), but which is merely similar in nature to those facts in issue (Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence </span>at paras 3.004–3.005, citing JF Stephen, <span class="font-italic">The Indian Evidence Act, with an Introduction on the Principles of Judicial Evidence </span>(Thacker, Spink &amp; Co, 1872) at p 55). The rule against similar fact evidence is therefore concerned with the use of such evidence in an impermissible way, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to infer from a person’s past crimes that he has a propensity or tendency to commit similar crimes (<span class="font-italic">Tan Meng Jee v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Jee</span>”) at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 66 at [17]). In other words, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is crucial (<span class="font-italic">Michael Anak Garing v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 748 at [8]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Meng Jee </span>at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It follows from the above analysis on ss 7 and 9 of the EA that the Report is in fact specifically connected with the facts in issue vis-à-vis the subject offences and so is not similar fact evidence. The proximity of about two to three months between the time the samples in the Report were collected and the time of the subject offences also does not present an issue to the said relevance. As noted in SC Sarkar, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Evidence in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Ceylon, Malaysia and Singapore</span> (LexisNexis, 18th Ed, 2014), s 7 of the EA is expressed in “terms much wider than those of s 6 which makes relevant facts forming <span class="font-italic">part of the same transaction</span> … facts though not strictly forming part of the transaction may be so closely connected with it that they tend to prove or disprove or explain the transaction under enquiry” (at p 300) [emphasis in original]. The <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence that the drugs were found in her blood and urine prior to the subject offences are not strictly connected with her having possibly administered the drugs to the babies, but nevertheless have in common the relevant fact of her access to the drugs towards the end of 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I note as well that in <span class="font-italic">Evidence</span>, Professor Pinsler had, in discussing similar fact evidence, observed that while the rules of admissibility appear to apply regardless of whether an accused person had intentionally or unintentionally disclosed evidence of his bad character, it is “arguable that the [P]rosecution should not be entitled to take advantage of the accused’s error by adducing evidence which would otherwise be inadmissible” (at para 3.051). He observes that an important question is then whether the court has a discretion to exclude or limit the use of such evidence, which I turn to consider next. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The court’s exclusionary discretion </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Appellant also argues that the Report should be excluded on the basis of the court’s residual discretion at common law to exclude evidence where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value (<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [51]–[53]; <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman bin Jumari v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 557 (“<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span>”) at [44]). Probative value has been defined as its ability to prove a fact in issue or a relevant fact; while its prejudicial effect refers to how its admission may be unfair to the accused person as a matter of process (<span class="font-italic">Sulaiman </span>at [47]). Probative value also varies depending on the type of evidence in question and the context in which it is sought to be adduced: for example, where there is lack of evidence on a relevant issue, the probative value of the evidence is likely to be higher (Australian Law Reform Commission, <span class="font-italic">Uniform Evidence Law Report </span>(ALRC Report 102, 2005) at para 16.15). In <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span>, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that the exclusionary discretion is concerned with the reliability of the evidence in question, having regard to whether there was “some form of unfairness in terms of the circumstances and process by which they were obtained” (at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, given there is no issue of unlawfulness in procuring the evidence or of bad faith, any prejudicial effect to the Appellant (as defined in [68]) is somewhat limited. On the former, the decision of <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>demonstrates that it is “only serious irregularities, meaning those that materially affect the evidential value of a voluntary statement”, that will suffice for the court to exercise the exclusionary discretion (at [65]). A failure to caution a person under s 122(6) of the CPC 1985 or to be informed of rights under s 121(2) of the same would not in themselves suffice (at [66]). There, the Court of Appeal found that breaches of s 121 of the CPC 1985 and the relevant Police General Orders were “serious enough to compromise in a material way” the reliability of the certain statements (at [146]). In contrast, there are no such questions of breaches of procedure compromising reliability in relation to the Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On the latter, it has been held in England that bad faith may be a factor leading to the exclusion of evidence under s 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (UK) (“PACE”), which confers on the court the discretion to exclude prejudicial evidence on which the Prosecution proposes to rely. Furthermore, evidence may nevertheless be excluded for serious breaches of procedure even if the police have acted in good faith (<span class="font-italic">Colin Carlton Alladice </span>(1988) 87 Cr App R 380 at 386). For example, in <span class="font-italic">Matto v Wolverhampton Crown Court</span> [1987] RTR 337, the English High Court held that given the Crown Court’s finding that the police officers knew they were in excess of their powers and therefore acted in bad faith in administering a breathalyser test, circumstances existed for the exclusion of evidence under s 78 of PACE. Again, I do not view the police or the Prosecution as having acted in bad faith in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As for instances where body samples taken in one inquiry are used in another, it seems that in the absence of any regulations governing their use or retention, there might only be issues of unfairness which may justify excluding the evidence if the accused was assured that this would not take place. This was the case in <span class="font-italic">R v Nathaniel</span> [1995] 2 Cr App R 565, where DNA evidence was given by an accused person in relation to a possible offence of rape involving two Danish girls of which he was later acquitted, and the police failed to destroy his DNA profile as required under s 64 of PACE

<div class="modal-body">
<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Section 64 of PACE at the time provided, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that if “(a) … samples are taken from a person in connection with the investigation of an offence; and (b) he is cleared of that offence; they must be destroyed as soon as is practicable after the conclusion of the proceeding”. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> even though they had informed him, before taking the sample, that such destruction would take place were he cleared of the offence. The police instead entered it on the Metropolitan computer index which matched him to another offence, for which he was arrested and convicted. The English Court of Appeal observed that not only had there been a breach of s 64, but the accused “had in effect been misled in consenting to give the blood sample by statements and promises which were not honoured” (at 571). Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 1999) </span>[2001] 2 AC 91, concerning a DNA profile from a saliva sample from a defendant’s charge of burglary (for which he was acquitted) which later linked him to a rape, the House of Lords held that wrongfully retained samples would nevertheless be admissible subject to the exclusionary discretion under s 78 of PACE. Lord Steyn expressed the view that there ought to be “fairness to all sides”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the accused, the victim and his or her family, and the public; and it was “in the interests of everyone that serious crime be effectively investigated and prosecuted” (at p 118). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Although s 78 of PACE casts the exclusionary discretion in wider terms than the common law discretion recognised in <span class="font-italic">R v Sang </span>[1980] 1 AC 402 (<span class="font-italic">R v Stephen Cooke </span>[1995] 1 Cr App R 318 at 328) and in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [51]–[53]), as it permits the exclusion of evidence having an “adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings”, the present case does seem to fall outside the ambit of a breach of procedure or impropriety such that the admission of the Report into evidence may be unfair to the Appellant as a matter of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This does not mean, however, that it would always be permissible for evidence voluntarily provided by a complainant to the police to be used subsequently against him in an unrelated criminal proceeding. It seems to me that this should be subject at least to the constraint that the evidence should have been reasonably obtained in respect of the initial suspected offence. Thus, where a complainant assists in investigations by, for example, handing over his phone, it would be reasonable for him to expect that the phone would be examined to the extent necessary for the offence complained of, and the evidence obtained from that investigation could be subsequently used against him in an unrelated criminal proceeding. That limitation does not arise here, since the Appellant’s blood and urine samples were obtained in relation to a suspected sexual offence against her, and would have been expected to be material evidence in relation to the alleged offence. Furthermore, it could certainly be the case that the court’s exclusionary discretion may still operate, where such evidence has more prejudicial effect than probative value. Again, however, that does not arise here since the Report was, as discussed, highly probative, with limited prejudicial effect. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) A right to privacy or confidentiality relating to information from one’s body</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I was concerned that there should be some privilege or right recognised protecting confidentiality or privacy concerning information from one’s own body. I have some sympathy for the concern that there should be some limits on the use of information relating to one’s own body. That is why there are often statutory controls imposed on the taking of samples, such as the taking of blood, urine or alcohol samples. It is intrusive. Furthermore, the use of such intrusive information voluntarily given by a person for another purpose would on the face of it raise, at least at first blush, concerns about fairness and breach of confidence. There may be an expectation that disclosure is to be used only for the purpose the information was given for. Whether that expectation should be protected or vindicated is, of course, another matter.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On the other hand, there is, of course, no express statement of any such right, either in the Constitution or the relevant criminal law statutes. There will, to my mind, be substantial factors militating against the recognition of any common law right or privilege, especially given the position I have reached above in respect of the court’s discretion to exclude. At the same time, while it is well established that personal or private information is protected by the law of confidence (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">X v Y and others </span>[1988] 2 All ER 648), such information is nevertheless not protected where there is a reasonable suspicion that it relates to crimes, frauds or misdeeds, or misconduct of such a nature that ought in the public interest be disclosed to others (<span class="font-italic">Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner </span>[1979] Ch 344 at 377; <span class="font-italic">Initial Services Ltd v Putterill and another </span>[1968] 1 QB 396 at 405). Even if the related tort of misuse of private information were to be recognised here (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">ZXC</span><span class="font-italic"> v Bloomberg LP</span> [2022] 2 WLR 424, where the UK Supreme Court found that a person under criminal investigation who had not been charged with a criminal offence had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation), it is recognised that the prevention and detection of crime and fraud would be a countervailing public interest (Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report on Civil Liability for Misuse of Private Information</span> (December 2020) at para 2.26); and the latter would likely prevail in the circumstances. Additionally, the absence of even any nascent protection for the privilege against self-incrimination in our jurisprudence is a strong pointer against the development of such common law rights or protection. And for many of the same reasons that the court’s exclusionary discretion should not be exercised against the admission of the Report, I do not see that there is any scope for the development of any such right or privilege.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect on the case as a whole if the Report were excluded from consideration  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I am satisfied that, in any event, any exclusion of the Report from consideration would not affect the correctness of the Appellant’s conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 This is because apart from the Report, a medical report from Everhealth Medical Centre showed that the Appellant had prescriptions for zolpidem (“Stilnox”), alprazolam (“Xanax”) and diazepam at the time of the offences.

</div> The Appellant argues that the Judge did not appreciate however that the same medical report provides that BB2’s parents were not too concerned initially after picking her up from the Appellant’s home, “as she was still able to play and interact normally”. This, she argues, suggests that the severity of BB2’s symptoms were not as serious as attested to by BB2’s parents.

Dr Koh opined that an acute overdose of benzodiazepines (or sleeping pills) such as alprazolam, diazepam, oxazepam and temazepam could result in somnolence, impaired coordination, confusion and diminished reflexes, which were seen in BB2; and the main adverse reactions in an acute overdose of chlorpheniramine, an anti-histamine, included drowsiness and fatigue, which was also seen in BB2.

Amongst other inconsistencies, her prescription records from Everhealth Medical Centre and her evidence on the stand regarding her familiarity with the drugs contradicted her Case for the Defence, where she stated that of the drugs found in the babies, she was familiar with alprazolam and zolpidem, but her prescription for the former only started in 2018 and she had never been prescribed or had taken diazepam from 2016.

There was no question either that these substances were not meant to be there: none of these were of the sort that would be administered normally to such babies, nor would they have ingested them on their own. It must thus be inferred that someone must have made them ingest the drugs or poison.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 With that as the starting point, the factual assessment must then turn to the determination of who had the opportunity and means to do so. The motive of the Appellant in doing so is not disclosed by the evidence, but that does not raise any reasonable doubt. The absence of a definitive motive does not undermine the strength of the evidence against her: many reasons or possibly no real reason could have underlain what she did. What her objective was in doing so would be known truly only to her. As examined above, no one else would reasonably have been able to commit the acts. The contrary version, that someone else could have committed the acts, was neither realistic nor reasonable. In particular, the access to drugs on the part of other possible suspects was not anywhere close to the same degree as the Appellant’s. While all of this was circumstantial, the cumulative effect of the evidence against her meant that there was an irresistible inference that she had indeed committed the offences with which she was charged. To recapitulate, the Appellant had:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The opportunity to commit the offences, while the babies were in her care;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) She had access to all of the drugs, found in the babies, since as shown by the Report, she had consumed the same medication herself.

The offence under s 328 of the Penal Code is a serious one which carries a mandatory imprisonment sentence which may extend to ten years (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Leong </span>[2016] SGDC 327 at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Bee Ling Lana </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 448 at [15]). The Judge had justifiably taken into account factors such as the young age of the Victims, which meant that they were wholly dependent on the Appellant while in her care; and the nature of the drugs administered, which placed the lives of the Victims at risk. For example, the evidence of Dr Low was that he would not have prescribed the subject drugs to children under six months of age, and would only administer small doses for those from six months to two years of age.
