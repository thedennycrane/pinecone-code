<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Patrick Tan Hup Yuan
                    (“the Plaintiff”) against the decision of the Assistant Registrar
                    dismissing the Plaintiff’s application in Originating Summons (Bankruptcy)
                    No 13/2013 (“the OSB 13/2013”) for the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the statutory demand
                        (“the Statutory Demand”) dated 13 February 2013 issued by
                        the defendants (“the Defendants”) against the Plaintiff
                        demanding payment of AUD3,037,236.88 be set aside;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the bankruptcy proceedings by the
                        Defendants against the Plaintiff be stayed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the Defendants pay the Plaintiff costs of
                        the originating summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing arguments, I dismissed the
                    Plaintiff’s appeal. I set out my reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The main issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The main issue was whether the Plaintiff could
                    rely on allegations of certain facts to resist the Statutory Demand in the light
                    of a settlement agreement and a consent judgment which I will elaborate on
                    below. I decided that he could not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Defendants commenced Suit No 749 of 2010
                    (“the Singapore Suit”) against the Plaintiff for, <em>inter alia</em>, an alleged breach of a deed of guarantee
                    dated 27 August 2010 (“the Guarantee”). The Plaintiff had
                    guaranteed the performance of the obligations of Montreal Capital Group Limited
                    (“Montreal”) under an agreement (“the Implementation
                    Agreement”) with the Defendants to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, inject fresh capital to the first defendant in voluntary
                    administration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Statutory Demand which was the subject of
                    OSB 13/2013 was issued when the Plaintiff failed to pay the sums due under a
                    consent judgment dated 20 November 2012 (“the Consent Judgment”)
                    made in the Singapore Suit by Prakash J. This Consent Judgment was made pursuant
                    to a settlement agreement dated 19 November 2012 entered into by the parties
                    (“the Settlement Agreement”). Clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement
                    was an entire agreement clause which provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement contains
                        the entire agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, negotiations
                        and agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff made two arguments to support his
                    application to set aside the Statutory Demand. First, the Defendants had
                    assigned to another party, through a Deed of Assignment and Appointment of
                    Attorney dated 28 February 2011 (“the Deed of
                    Assignment”), its interests under the Guarantee dated 27 August 2010
                    entered into between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. Since the
                    Defendants’ claim in the Singapore Suit was on the basis of a breach of
                    this guarantee which had been assigned to another party, the Defendants were not
                    entitled to maintain the Singapore Suit and enter judgment against the
                    Plaintiff. I will refer to this argument as “the <em>locus
                        standi</em> argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Secondly, the Plaintiff argued that he had a
                    valid cross-claim against the Defendants arising from the Defendants’
                    breach of an alleged agreement made at a meeting on 27 August 2012 in
                    Sydney which I will refer to as “the Sydney Agreement”. I will
                    refer to this argument as “the cross-claim
                argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The thrust of the Sydney Agreement was as
                    follows. The Plaintiff had allegedly agreed to discount five standby letters of
                    credit totalling AUD250m which the Defendants were looking to discount, at
                    between 5% to 6%. In consideration of this, the Defendants allegedly agreed
                    before the Settlement Agreement dated 19 November 2012 and the Consent
                    Judgment dated 20 November 2002 that the Singapore Suit would be considered
                    settled. The Defendants were to furnish information showing the primary text of
                    the standby letters of credit, which would allow the Plaintiff’s bank to
                    quote the applicable rates. AUD250m was to be held on escrow by the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel. If the Defendants were to receive confirmation from
                    the Plaintiff’s bank that the bank was prepared to discount the letters of
                    credit, this sum would not be remitted to the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Pursuant to the Sydney Agreement, the Plaintiff
                    contacted JP Morgan, Singapore, and secured it as the discounting bank at a rate
                    of 5.5%. At the Defendants’ request, the Plaintiff and JP Morgan signed a
                    non-disclosure agreement before the Defendants would release the wording of the
                    standby letters of credit. However, the Defendants allegedly failed to provide
                    the Plaintiff with the wording of the standby letters of credit despite repeated
                    requests to do so. Accordingly, the Plaintiff claimed to have suffered loss and
                    damage from the Defendant’s breach of the Sydney Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In respect of the <em>locus
                        standi</em> argument, the Defendants argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff was attempting to go
                        behind the Consent Judgment and inquire into the validity of the debt, and
                        this was not permissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The fact that the Plaintiff had not proceeded to set
                        aside the Consent Judgment showed that he did not believe that he had
                        legitimate grounds to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff’s argument was in effect, a plea that
                        there was no cause of action between the Defendants and the Plaintiff. This
                        was prohibited by cause of action estoppel by virtue of the Consent
                        Judgment. In the alternative, the issue was fundamental to the finding of
                        the Plaintiff’s liability established by the Consent Judgment.
                        Accordingly, an issue estoppel operated to prevent the Plaintiff from
                        raising this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In respect of the cross-claim argument, the
                    gist of the Defendants’ argument was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff was precluded from
                        relying on the Sydney Agreement in view of cl 6 of the Settlement
                        Agreement, which was the entire agreement clause; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the cross-claim argument was not
                        credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As regards the <em>locus
                        standi</em> argument, the starting point was r 98(2) of the
                    Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Revised Edition) (“the
                    Rules”), which set out the grounds which a court could rely on to set
                    aside a statutory demand:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>98.</b>—(1) On the hearing of the
                        application, the court may either summarily determine the application or
                        adjourn it, giving such directions as it thinks appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The court shall set aside the statutory demand if —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the debtor appears to have a valid counterclaim, set-off or cross
                        demand which is equivalent to or exceeds the amount of the debt or debts
                        specified in the statutory demand;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) the debt is disputed on grounds which appear to the court to be
                        substantial;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) it appears that the creditor holds assets of the debtor or security in
                        respect of the debt claimed by the demand, and either rule 94(5) has not
                        been complied with, or the court is satisfied that the value of the assets
                        or security is equivalent to or exceeds the full amount of the debt;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) rule 94(1) has not been complied with; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e) the court is satisfied, on other grounds, that the demand ought to be
                        set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Rule 98(2)(e) of the Rules is to be read with
                    para 144 of the <em>Supreme Court Practice Directions</em>
                    (2013 Ed, 1 January 2013 release) (“the PD”) which
                    provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>144. Applications to set aside
                            statutory demands made under the Bankruptcy
                        Rules</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Rule 97 of the Bankruptcy Rules allows debtors to apply to set aside
                        statutory demands within 14 days from the date of service; or, where the
                        demand was served outside jurisdiction, within 21 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Without prejudice to Rule 98 of the Bankruptcy Rules, on an
                        application to set aside a statutory demand based on a judgment or an order,
                        the Court will <em>not go behind the judgment or
                            order</em> and <em>inquire into the validity of the
                            debt</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) When the debtor:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) claims to have a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand (whether or not
                        he could have raised it in the action or proceedings in which the judgment
                        or order was obtained) which equals or exceeds the amount of the debt or
                        debts specified in the statutory demand; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) disputes the debt (not being a debt subject to a judgment or
                        order),</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court will <em>normally</em> set aside the
                        statutory demand if, in its opinion, on the evidence there is a <em>genuine triable issue</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Where there is a genuine triable issue, the
                    court will normally set aside the statutory demand, but it is not obliged to do
                    so: <em>Mohd Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International
                        Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2014] 2 SLR 446
                        (“<em>Chimbusco</em>”) at [29]. It will
                    not suffice for a debtor to raise spurious allegations in order to fend off
                    bankruptcy proceedings. The court will only set aside a statutory demand where
                    the debtor is able to adduce evidence on affidavit that raises a triable issue:
                        <em>Chimbusco</em> at [30].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, there was no dissonance between
                    the Rules and the PD. The effect of para 144(2) of the PD was to supplement
                    r 98(2)(b) because r 98(2) is not confined to the situation where the
                    statutory demand is based on a judgment, <em>ie</em>, the
                    statutory demand may not be based on a judgment. However, where it is based on a
                    judgment, para 144(2) of the PD states that the court will not inquire into the
                    validity of the debt. In other words, any dispute on the debt will not appear to
                    be substantial under r 98(2)(b). While practice directions do not have the force
                    of law (see <em>BNP Paribas (formerly known as Banque National De
                        Paris) v Polynesia Timber Services Pte Ltd and another</em> [2002] 1
                    SLR(R) 539 at [37]; <em>Odex Pte Ltd v Pacific Internet
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 18 at [29] and [30]), they are directions
                    from the court nonetheless and a court will not normally depart from its
                    directions unless there is a good reason for doing so. Moreover, para 144(2) is
                    consistent with what is already the law on <em>res
                        judicata</em> which I will elaborate on below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, the <em>locus standi</em> argument challenged the Defendants’
                    entitlement to commence the Singapore Suit against the Plaintiff as the
                        <em>locus standi</em> argument was that the Defendants
                    were not the right parties to make the original claim in the Singapore Suit. In
                    my view, by making this argument, the Plaintiff was asking the court to go
                    behind the Consent Judgment and inquire into the validity of the debt, namely,
                    whether the debt was indeed owed to the Defendants. The Plaintiff was not
                    entitled to do this pursuant to para 144(2) of the PD. By consenting to the
                    Consent Judgment, he had accepted that the Defendants were entitled to make the
                    claim. The proper step for him would have been to apply to set aside the Consent
                    Judgment but he did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Moreover, I was of the view that the Plaintiff
                    was prevented from making the <em>locus standi</em>
                    argument by a principle of <em>res judicata</em>, namely
                    cause of action estoppel. Cause of action estoppel was explained by Diplock LJ
                    (as he then was) in <em>Thoday v Thoday</em> [1964] 2 WLR
                    371 (“<em>Thoday</em>”) at 384:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[C]ause of action estoppel,” is that which prevents a party
                        to an action from asserting or denying, as against the other party, the
                        existence of a particular cause of action, the non-existence or existence of
                        which has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in previous
                        litigation between the same parties. If the cause of action was determined
                        to exist, i.e., judgment was given upon it, it is said to be merged in the
                        judgment, … If it was determined not to exist, the unsuccessful
                        plaintiff can no longer assert that it does; he is estopped <em>per rem judicatam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the present case, the Consent Judgment
                    provided that final judgment had been entered against the Plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>UPON HEARING</u></b> Counsel for the
                        [Defendants] and the [Plaintiff], <b><u>IT IS ORDERED BY
                            CONSENT</u></b> that final judgment be entered against the
                        [Plaintiff] <b><u>AND IT IS ORDERED</u></b> that:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(1) The [Plaintiff] pay to the [Defendants] the sum of AUD
                            3,000,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(2) Interest on the Judgment sum of AUD3,000,000 at the rate of 5.33%
                            per annum to be calculated from the date of the Judgment until the
                            Judgment is satisfied;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(3) Execution of this Judgment by the [Defendants] shall be stayed
                            until 31 January 2013; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(4) No order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In my view, since the Consent Judgment
                    provided that final judgment be entered against the Plaintiff and that the
                    Plaintiff was to pay the Defendants the above-stated sum, the Plaintiff was to
                    be taken to have consented to the Defendants’
                    <em>locus standi</em> to make the claim. A consent order
                    was as efficacious as orders pronounced after a contest in creating cause of
                    action estoppel: see KR Handley, <em>Spencer Bower and Handley:
                        Res Judicata</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) at para 2.16; <em>Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil
                        Uddin</em> [2012] 3 SLR 1003 at [18]. The Plaintiff’s <em>locus standi</em> argument, in essence, was that the
                    Defendants were not entitled to commence the Singapore Suit based on the
                    guarantee because the rights under the guarantee had been assigned to another
                    party. In effect, this was a plea that the Defendants had no cause of action
                    against the Plaintiff and hence contradicted the Consent Judgment which was
                    given on the basis that the Defendants have a cause of action against the
                    Plaintiff. Therefore, the Plaintiff was precluded from making the <em>locus standi</em> argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I was also of the view that the Plaintiff was
                    precluded by the defence of abuse of process from raising the <em>locus standi</em> argument. The defence of abuse of process, although
                    distinct, was accepted as “the extended doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>” or “doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> in the wider sense”: see <em>Lee Hiok Tng (in her personal capacity) v Lee Hiok Tng and another
                        (executors and trustees of the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased) and
                        others</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 771 at [21]–[22]. Essentially, this
                    defence does not permit matters to be raised which ought to have been raised in
                    earlier proceedings. The traditional formulation of the defence was articulated
                    by Wigram VC in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>
                    [1843–1860] All ER Rep 378 at 381–382. The modern restatement of the
                    defence is found in <em>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a
                        Firm)</em> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<em>Johnson</em>”) at 31.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> abuse of process,
                        as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action
                        estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The underlying
                        public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and
                        that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public
                        interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in
                        the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as
                        a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later
                        proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied
                        (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence
                        should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at
                        all. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised
                        in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of
                        it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic
                        an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment
                        which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also
                        takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on <em>the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party
                            is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise
                            before it the issue which could have been raised before.</em> As
                        one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot
                        formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse
                        is to be found or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The modern restatement of the defence in
                        <em>Johnson</em> has been followed in <em>Kwa Ban Cheong v Kuah Boon Sek and others</em> [2003] 3
                    SLR(R) 644 at [25]–[26], <em>Lai Swee Lin Linda v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [62], and <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                    453 (“<em>Goh Nellie”</em>) at
                [52].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I refer to the helpful guidance provided by
                        <em>Goh Nellie</em> at [53]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… To put it shortly, a court should determine whether there is an
                        abuse of process by looking at all the circumstances of the case, including
                        whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral
                        attack upon the previous decision; whether there is fresh evidence that
                        might warrant re-litigation; whether there are <em>bona
                            fide</em> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in
                        the earlier action was not; and whether there are some other special
                        circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence
                        or existence of these enumerated factors (which are not intended to be
                        exhaustive) is not decisive. In determining whether the ambient
                        circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court should
                        not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by
                        the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that
                        a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and
                        recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be
                        unduly oppressive to the defendant. In the context of cases such as the
                        present, the inquiry is directed not at the theoretical possibility that the
                        issue raised in the later proceedings could conceivably have been taken in
                        the earlier but rather at whether, having regard to the substance and
                        reality of the earlier action, it reasonably ought to have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the Plaintiff failed to
                    raise the <em>locus standi</em> argument in the Singapore
                    Suit, but instead agreed to the Consent Judgment to be entered. In reaching the
                    conclusion that the Plaintiff’s raising of the <em>locus
                        standi</em> argument warranted the operation of the defence of abuse
                    of process, I was guided by the need to consider the balance between the demands
                    of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case
                    in court, and the recognition that there would come a point beyond which
                    repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to a defendant. In my view, the
                    Plaintiff should not have agreed to the Consent Judgment if he did not accept
                    that the Defendants were the correct claimants. No reason was given as to why he
                    raised the <em>locus standi</em> argument so late. In the
                    circumstances, the Plaintiff’s attempt to set aside the Statutory Demand
                    in the present case had become unduly oppressive to the Defendants and was
                    nothing more than a collateral attack on the Consent Judgment. I found that the
                        <em>locus standi</em> argument was, in substance, an
                    attempt by the Plaintiff to deny the Defendants, through the back door, their
                    fruits of the Consent Judgment. Therefore, the defence of abuse of process
                    operated against the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me
                    to elaborate on issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I now come to the cross-claim
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As stated above at [7]–[8], the
                    Plaintiff argued that he had a valid cross-claim against the Defendants arising
                    from the Defendants’ alleged breach of the Sydney Agreement, which in turn
                    provided that in consideration of the Plaintiff agreeing to discount the
                    Defendants’ standby letters of credit, the Singapore Suit would be
                    considered settled. In my view, the Plaintiff’s cross-claim argument was
                    not correctly characterised as a cross-claim or counterclaim. Instead, the
                    Plaintiff’s cross-claim argument would in substance be a defence to the
                    Defendants’ claim in the Singapore Suit because the Plaintiff appeared to
                    be alleging that the Plaintiff’s benefit from the alleged Sydney Agreement
                    was that the Singapore Suit would be considered settled. Accordingly, the same
                    objections against the Plaintiff raising the <em>locus
                        standi</em> argument apply to the Plaintiff’s cross-claim
                    argument, namely, the Plaintiff was precluded from raising the cross-claim
                    argument pursuant to para 144(2) of the PD. Also, the defence of abuse of
                    process applied (see above [16] and [23]). Therefore, I did not find that the
                    debt was disputed on grounds which appeared to be substantial or that there were
                    any genuine triable issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In any event, any alleged Sydney Agreement was
                    clearly and expressly superseded by cl 6 of the Settlement Agreement, which
                    provided that the Settlement Agreement superseded any prior understandings,
                    negotiations and agreements with respect to the Singapore Suit (see above at
                    [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For the reasons set out, I dismissed the
                    appeal with costs fixed at $8,000 to the Defendants inclusive of
                    disbursements.</p>
