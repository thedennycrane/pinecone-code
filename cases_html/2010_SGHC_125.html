        Yeong Zee Kin SAR:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the Defendant under
                    Practice Direction No 3 of 2009 (“PD 3/2009”) for an order
                    that parties comply with an electronic discovery protocol when general discovery
                    of documents is given in this case. The Plaintiff’s objections to this
                    application may be summarised in the following manner: First, PD 3/2009 applies
                    during general discovery only where parties have agreed to adopt an electronic
                    discovery protocol and allows parties to refer any disputes over terms in the
                    protocol to the court for resolution. Since parties in this case have not agreed
                    to adopt an electronic discovery protocol for the purposes of general discovery,
                    there is no basis for this application. Further, the Plaintiff objects to
                    adoption of such a protocol as it would unfairly prejudice them since they are
                    ready to proceed with general discovery by providing a list of documents and
                    photocopies of documents disclosed in the list in the traditional
                manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The underlying claims in this matter may be
                    summarised as follows. The Defendant was a customer of the Plaintiff bank. The
                    Defendant owes about USD 1.8 million under a loan facility granted by the
                    Plaintiff. The Plaintiff commenced action by writ filed on 27 August 2009
                    and sued for recovery of the outstanding sums under the loan facility. In its
                    defence and counterclaim filed on 2 September 2009, the Defendant
                    counterclaimed against the Plaintiff and (in an amendment filed on
                    3 November 2009) its employee, the Plaintiff’s former relationship
                    manager, for misrepresentation and breaches of fiduciary duties and duties of
                    skill and care. The Plaintiff’s reply and defence to counterclaim was
                    filed on 19 October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The issue of electronic discovery was first
                    raised by the Defendant during pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on
                    23 October 2009. The court’s record shows that Defendant’s
                    solicitors had suggested that parties proceed with electronic discovery in this
                    case and sought directions for parties to discuss and agree to an electronic
                    discovery protocol. Plaintiff’s solicitors are recorded to have said that
                    they did not think that electronic discovery was necessary and they would need
                    to take instructions on this matter. The court directed that parties update the
                    court during the next PTC as to whether parties are amenable to proceeding with
                    electronic discovery. Further, directions were given for lists of documents to
                    be exchanged by 29 January 2010 and for inspection to be completed by
                    26 February 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequent to this, there were telephone
                    discussions between counsel on 5 and 6 January 2010, ahead of the PTC on
                    8 January 2010. There is some dispute over the content of the telephone
                    discussions. The Defendant’s solicitors’ account is that they raised
                    again the issue of electronic discovery during these telephone discussions and
                    sought opposing solicitors’ agreement to defer electronic discovery issues
                    to a subsequent PTC to be fixed before me. The Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors’ recollection is that the discussions focused mainly on
                    agreeing to an adjournment of the 8 January 2010 PTC as there were pending
                    interlocutory applications at that time. A PTC briefing note tendered by the
                    Defendant’s solicitors during PTC on 8 January 2010, which is as near
                    to a contemporaneous record of these telephone discussions as is available to
                    me, records that the Defendant’s solicitors had broached the issue of
                    electronic discovery during these telephone conversations and sought to have a
                    PTC fixed before me to explore how parties may collaborate on electronic
                    discovery issues in accordance with PD 3/2009. It is also recorded that the
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors communicated their view that there is no scope for
                    discussion and they would object to moving the PTC; further, they had requested
                    that a formal application for electronic discovery be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The PTC on 8 January 2010 dealt mainly with
                    pending interlocutory matters and an interlocutory appeal. During this PTC,
                    pending discovery directions were ordered to be held in abeyance as parties were
                    directed to make a decision as to whether they would proceed with electronic
                    discovery under PD 3/2009. In particular, the Defendant was directed to write to
                    the Plaintiff with a proposed electronic discovery protocol by 22 January
                    2010 and the Plaintiff was directed to reply by 5 February 2010. The
                    Defendant was further directed to write in by 12 February 2010 to request
                    for a PTC to be fixed before me if they wish to discuss electronic discovery
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Eventually, several PTCs were held on
                    18 February, 3 and 8 March 2010 before me to explore the possibility
                    of adopting an electronic discovery protocol for the conduct of general
                    discovery. Parties were not able to agree, hence this application before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During submissions, the following issues were
                    raised. First, whether PD 3/2009 applies in a situation where parties had
                        <em>not</em> reached an agreement to adopt an
                    electronic discovery protocol during general discovery; in other words, whether
                    PD 3 2/2009 applies during general discovery <em>only
                        if</em> parties have already agreed to adopt an electronic discovery
                    protocol but were not able to agree on some of its terms
                subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Second, whether an order should be made in this
                    case for an electronic discovery protocol to be adopted when the Plaintiff is
                    ready to provide general discovery by giving photocopies of documents disclosed
                    in its list of documents (which, though not filed, is ready to be filed). Was
                    there any delay on the part of the Defendants that makes the adoption of an
                    electronic discovery protocol during general discovery unnecessary in this case
                    for the fair disposal of this matter or for saving costs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Third, if parties are to comply with an
                    electronic discovery protocol for general discovery, should the Plaintiff be
                    required to provide the categories of documents described as well as conduct a
                    reasonable search based on the key words set out in Part I of the draft
                    electronic discovery protocol. I shall now deal with these issues in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applicability of PD 3/2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff’s preliminary objection to
                    this application is that PD 3/2009 does not apply to a situation where parties
                    have not reached a prior agreement to adopt an electronic discovery protocol
                    during general discovery. The Plaintiff argues that the opt-in nature of PD
                    3/2009 means that, insofar as its applicability during general discovery is
                    concerned, both parties must <em>first</em> agree to adopt
                    an electronic discovery protocol <em>before</em> PD 3/2009
                    applies during general discovery. This argument turns on a construction of PD
                    3/2009 that, stated briefly, amounted to the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">During general discovery, paragraph 43B of PD
                            3/2009 applies initially when parties discuss whether to adopt an
                            electronic discovery protocol. If parties are able to agree to adopt
                            one, but they are unable to agree on some of the terms in the protocol
                            under discussion, then an application may be made under paragraph
                            43B(3).</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If, however, parties are unable to reach an
                            agreement whether to adopt an electronic discovery protocol for the
                            purposes of general discovery, paragraph 43B of PD 3/2009 ceases to be
                            applicable such that the party seeking electronic discovery may not make
                            an application under paragraph 43B(3). In such circumstances, general
                            discovery should be conducted in the classical style where documents are
                            disclosed in a list of documents, inspection given of hard copies and
                            photocopies of discoverable documents provided. Under this construction,
                            the Plaintiff argues that PD 3/2009 is only applicable after general
                            discovery: in other words, paragraph 43B is not applicable but paragraph
                            43C, <em>et seq</em> are applicable to requests for
                            further discovery or specific discovery.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defendant’s argument is that the
                    court has extensive powers to order compliance with protocol during discovery.
                    This is either part of the court’s inherent powers (preserved under Order
                    92, rule 4) or derived from the specific provisions in Order 34A, which is the
                    source of the court’s powers to make appropriate directions for the just,
                    expeditious and economical disposal of a matter. Counsel cites the cases of
                        <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and
                        another suit</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 343 and <em>Fermin Aldabe v Standard Chartered Bank</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 194 as authorities for his proposition that the courts
                    have the power to order discovery of electronic documents and in so doing, order
                    that parties comply with a protocol. Both of these cases were decided before PD
                    3/2009 came into effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Plaintiff’s preliminary objection
                    arises from the construction of the phrase “If parties are unable to
                    agree on an electronic discovery protocol” in paragraph 43B of PD 3/2009.
                    The Plaintiff seeks a construction of this phrase to mean “If parties
                        <em>having agreed to adopt an electronic discovery
                        protocol</em> are unable to agree on <em>some of the
                        terms in</em> the electronic discovery protocol”. The Plaintiff
                    argues that this gives effect to the opt-in nature of PD 3/2009: in other words,
                    both parties must agree to opt-in before PD 3/2009 applies. The Defendant seeks
                    a broader construction for this phrase to include both situations where parties
                    are unable to agree to adopt an electronic discovery protocol or, having agreed
                    to adopt one, there are disputes over some of its terms. Under this
                    construction, the opt-in framework operates either by agreement of parties or
                    when one party (in this case the Defendant) opts into PD 3/2009 by making an
                    application thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In determining the proper construction to be
                    adopted, it is necessary to commence with an appreciation of the nature of
                    practice directions. I can do no better than to quote Professor Jeffrey
                    Pinsler’s <em>Singapore Court Practice (2003
                        Edition)</em>, at § 1/1/6, on the role and function
                    of practice directions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… practice directions issued by the courts have a fundamental role
                        in supplementing the rules of court. … They may explain the proper
                        practice under the rules, and show how those rules are to be complied with.
                        … Practice directions may provide the details which may not be
                        included in a particular rule. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although practice directions may not have the force of substantive law
                        (see <em>Hume v Somerton</em> (1890)
                        25 QBD 239, at 243; <em>Barclays Bank International
                            v Levin Bros (Bradford)</em> [1977] QB 270; <em>Jayasankaran v PP</em> [1983] 1 MLJ 379
                        (concerning a practice note: court said that it is not intended to be more
                        than a direction for administrative purposes and ‘cannot be exalted
                        into a rule of law’)), non-compliance may result in adverse orders
                        against the defaulting party. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a case concerning the effect of practice directions, <em>Ooi Bee Tat v Ah Chim &amp; Sons</em> [1995] 3 MLJ 465,
                        at 470, Zakaria Yatim JCA, who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court,
                        stated that practice directions ‘are intended to be no more than a
                        direction for administrative purposes’ (also see <em>Jayasankaran v PP</em> [1983] 1 MLJ 379, at 380, which
                        is cited for this proposition). <em>Therefore, it is clear
                            that a practice direction does not have the force of a rule of court and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     PD 3/2009 does not set out to change the law
                    on discovery; it merely sets out procedures which parties have to comply with
                    when dealing with discovery of electronically stored documents. Where the court
                    already has powers to order that parties comply with a protocol when discovery
                    of electronically stored documents is given, PD 3/2009 does not subtract from
                    these powers. However, any failure to comply with the requirements of PD 3/2009
                    may be relevant when the court has to exercise its discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is not disputed that the court has powers
                    to order compliance with a protocol where one is necessary. Protocols are no
                    more than procedures intended to guide conduct of parties; and an electronic
                    discovery protocol is no more than a label applied to a protocol for the
                    discovery of electronically stored documents which parties agree to for the
                    purpose of conducting general discovery. In the context of electronic discovery,
                    a protocol will set out the procedures for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, safeguards against unauthorised trawling (see above,
                        <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendelton Lane P</em>),
                    inspection of electronic documents and provision of copies of discoverable
                    electronic documents (see above, <em>Fermin Aldabe v Standard
                        Chartered Bank</em>). Bearing in mind that the court already has the
                    power to order that parties comply with a protocol, I do not think that the
                    construction of paragraph 43B(3) put forth by the Plaintiff should be adopted.
                    To do so would amount to saying that whereas before PD 3/2009 was issued, the
                    court could make an order for parties to comply with a protocol during
                    discovery, it can no longer do so now in a situation where parties cannot agree
                    to adopt one. This tantamounts to elevating PD 3/2009 to a rule-making function
                    with the effect of removing the court’s power to order compliance with a
                    protocol in a situation where there is no pre-existing agreement between parties
                    to adopt one. Further, the opt-in framework would operate differently at
                    different stages of litigation under the Plaintiff’s construction: during
                    general discovery, paragraph 43B operates only by mutual consent, but for
                    applications for further or specific discovery, paragraph 43C operates by both
                    mutual consent or the election of one party. To my mind, such inconsistency in
                    the application of PD 3/2009 is undesirable and should be eschewed when an
                    alternative construction capable of avoiding such internal inconsistencies is
                    available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I prefer the construction put forth by the
                    Defendant. PD 3/2009 in effect establishes a procedure whereby parties are
                    required to make attempts to collaborate in good faith by engaging in
                    discussions of electronic discovery issues before an application may be made
                    under paragraph 43B. The opt-in nature of PD 3/2009 allows both parties to agree
                    not to apply these procedures whether expressly or tacitly by conduct. Where one
                    party wishes to make an application under PD 3/2009, he must comply with the
                    procedures set forth therein and he must support his application with an
                    affidavit providing an account of efforts made in good faith collaboration as
                    well as include a draft electronic discovery protocol with his application. This
                    construction does not subtract from the court’s power to order compliance
                    with a protocol when discovery of electronically stored documents is ordered. It
                    also gives effect to the opt-in nature of PD 3/2009: unlike other practice
                    directions which apply to all cases, PD 3/2009 applies either on mutual
                    agreement of parties or when one party opts into the electronic discovery
                    framework by making an application thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Additionally, the construction put forth by
                    the Defendant accords with the plain reading of paragraph 43B(3). The phrase
                    “If parties are unable to agree on an electronic discovery
                    protocol”, to my mind, is sufficiently broad to deal with both
                    situations: the situation where there is a pre-existing agreement to adopt an
                    electronic discovery protocol but disputes remain over some of its terms, as
                    well as the situation where parties are unable even to agree to adopt an
                    electronic discovery protocol. Under the Defendant’s construction, the
                    opt-in framework operates consistently both during general discovery and when
                    applications for further or specific discovery are made:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">During general discovery, where parties have a
                            pre-existing agreement to adopt an electronic discovery protocol, they
                            may refer any disputes over any proposed term to the court for
                            directions, and where one party seeks to adopt an electronic discovery
                            protocol but the other does not agree, the party seeking discovery may
                            make an application under PD 3/2009.</div>

                            No case is shut out under this construction, unless parties in the
                            case agree not to apply PD 3/2009 either expressly or tacitly by
                            conduct.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there was delay in initiating discussions for an e-discovery
                protocol</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff also objects to an electronic
                    discovery protocol on the ground that the Defendant’s delay in commencing
                    good faith discussions prejudices it. The Plaintiff’s submission is that
                    during the PTC on 23 October 2009, the Defendant’s solicitors stated
                    that they were considering electronic discovery. However, the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors did not understand this to mean that the Defendant was definitely
                    proceeding with electronic discovery, but merely considering it as an option.
                    During the telephone discussions on 5 and 6 January 2010, there were
                    (according to Plaintiff’s solicitors) no substantive discussions about
                    electronic discovery as parties were discussing a possible adjournment of the
                    PTC on 8 January 2010 in light of other pending interlocutory applications
                    and an interlocutory appeal. There was some discussion for the adjournment of
                    the PTC on 8 January 2010 and for the adjourned PTC to be fixed for hearing
                    before me for the purpose of discussing electronic discovery issues, but there
                    were no substantive discussions of electronic discovery issues. As far as the
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors were concerned, the first time that they knew that
                    the Defendant was indeed pursuing electronic discovery was when they received a
                    letter from the Defendant’s solicitors on 22 January 2010 on this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Defendant’s version is that their
                    solicitors first raised the issue of electronic discovery during PTC on
                    23 October 2009. Further, although the court gave directions for the filing
                    of lists of documents during the PTC, parties were directed to discuss whether
                    an electronic discovery protocol should be adopted and to update the court at
                    the next PTC on 8 January 2010. According to the Defendant’s
                    solicitors, one of the topics discussed during the telephone conversations
                    between counsel on 5 and 6 January 2010 was for the possibility that the
                    upcoming PTC on 8 January 2010 be adjourned to be heard by me for the
                    purpose of discussion electronic discovery issues. During the telephone
                    conversations, the Plaintiff’s solicitors had requested that a formal
                    application for electronic discovery be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The court’s record reflects that
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors had consistently raised the issue of electronic
                    discovery from the first PTC on 23 October 2009 onwards: see paragraphs 3
                    to 5 above for a summary of the history of exchanges on the issue of electronic
                    discovery during PTCs. Further, the record shows that the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors had been consistently non-committal and that they had requested for a
                    formal application under PD 3/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Paragraph 43B of PD 3/2009 establishes the
                    timeframe for parties to commence discussion of electronic discovery issues for
                    the purpose of general discovery: this is to take place “immediately
                    after the close of pleadings”. In this case, the Reply and Defence to
                    Counterclaim was filed on 19 October 2009. When the issue of electronic
                    discovery was first raised during PTC on 23 October 2009, pleadings had not
                    yet closed. Evidently, there has been no delay on the part of the Defendant at
                    all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether an order for compliance with an electronic discovery protocol
                for the purposes of general discovery should be ordered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I turn now to consider whether the facts of
                    this case merit an order for the adoption of an electronic discovery protocol
                    during general discovery. Paragraph 43D enumerates a list of factors which the
                    court has to consider during the exercise of its discretion as to whether an
                    order for discovery or inspection of electronically stored documents should be
                    made under the framework for electronic discovery in PD 3/2009. The list is not
                    exhaustive and is intended to be inclusive: some of the factors may be relevant
                    some of the time, but not all of them all of the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Number of electronic documents involved</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     During submissions, it was made clear that the
                    volume of documents in this case, though not trivial, is not exactly voluminous
                    either. The majority of the documents reside with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff
                    had printed all the relevant documents and these amounted to about 9 arch lever
                    files, out of which 5–6 were comprised of e-mails, which form the majority
                    of discoverable documents. It was submitted on behalf of the Plaintiff that the
                    benefits of electronic discovery lie in the ability to access metadata
                    information, the ease of management of voluminous documents and the ability to
                    conduct key word searches. Since the extent of discoverable documents in this
                    case is not voluminous, the Plaintiff submitted that the benefits of management
                    and key word searches would not be reaped. It was further submitted that since
                    metadata information is not relevant to the issues in this case, there was no
                    reason left to consider electronic discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     To my mind, I think that the premise that
                    electronic discovery is only beneficial for cases where documents are voluminous
                    needs to be re-examined. This misconception stems from the association of
                    electronic discovery with forensic techniques of acquiring electronic documents
                    (eg cloning of storage devices like hard disk drives) and the use of key word
                    searches to locate documents (eg forensic tools to search for key words in the
                    unallocated space and file slack of hard disk drives). These concepts should be
                    dissociated. It is not in every case that forensic techniques are required for
                    the preservation of evidence when litigation is contemplated or when litigation
                    has commenced. There may be some categories of cases where forensic techniques
                    are required <em>de rigueur</em>, for example cases
                    involving falsification of accounts or forgery of documents. In the majority of
                    cases, all that may well be required is an appreciation, when identifying and
                    setting aside (or making copies of) electronic documents for the purposes of
                    giving discovery, that electronic documents may be altered inadvertently when
                    they are accessed and changes saved. It may oftentimes be sufficient to make a
                    copy of potentially discoverable documents in an optical read-only medium (eg CD
                    or DVD RW discs) and to take care not to delete the originals. Once the cost of
                    forensic acquisition is obviated, the purportedly high cost of electronic
                    discovery diminishes significantly. To draw an analogy with discovery of paper
                    documents, one would not employ forensic techniques to preserve paper documents
                    and look for fingerprint evidence in every case. What most lawyers advise is
                    that the originals of potentially discoverable documents be set aside and
                    working copies made. We should deploy the same measure of temperance when
                    dealing with electronic documents and guard against treating electronic
                    documents with a surfeit of caution. This horses for courses approach is
                    succinctly put in principle 5 of the Ontario Bar Association’s <em>E-Discovery Guidelines</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As soon as litigation is contemplated or threatened, parties should
                        immediately take reasonable and good faith steps to preserve relevant
                        electronic documents. However, it is unreasonable to expect parties to take
                        every conceivable step to preserve all documents that may be potentially
                        relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     When the preponderance of documents these days
                    originates and is stored in an electronic form, it is desirable that discovery
                    be given in an electronic form as well, preferably in the native format.
                    Granted, the benefits of electronic document review software platforms that are
                    available are more readily appreciated where documents under review are
                    voluminous. However, this should not lead to the opposite conclusion that little
                    or no benefit will be reaped if the volume of documents is comparatively lower
                    such that the costs of deploying a document review software platform is not
                    commensurate with the benefits. Most operating systems come with advanced search
                    engines these days and the utility of discoverable documents in text searchable
                    format when preparing affidavits of evidence-in-chief and preparing for trial
                    cannot be denied. Hence, even where the volume of documents is not voluminous,
                    parties should consider the proportion of electronic documents <em>vis-a-vis</em> the total volume of documents that are to be
                    discovered. I should think that it will be in the increasingly rare situations
                    where the volume of electronic documents is insignificant compared to the total
                    volume of documents to be discovered that electronic documents should be
                    produced in printed form during discovery. For the majority of cases, electronic
                    documents should be produced in native format during discovery unless there is
                    good reason not to do so, or parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature of case and complexity of issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Plaintiff’s claim is one for the
                    straightforward repayment of a loan. The crux of this case lies in the
                    Defendant’s counterclaim against the Plaintiff which raises issues of
                    breaches of fiduciary duties, breaches of duty of care and misrepresentation
                    against the Plaintiff; and breaches of warranty of authority and
                    misrepresentation against his relationship manager, an employee of the Plaintiff
                    whom the Defendant joined as a defendant in the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     During submissions, it became clear that this
                    case had international dimensions: although the account was maintained in the
                    Plaintiff’s branch in Singapore, the Plaintiff’s key employees who
                    are involved in this matter reside in Hong Kong and the Defendant is a Taiwanese
                    resident. Most of the documents to be given during discovery lie with the
                    Plaintiff. E-mails form the majority of electronic documents which are
                    discoverable (6 out of 9 arch lever files). The original e-mails of the
                    Plaintiff’s key employees and its electronic customer records are held in
                    Hong Kong. The Defendant’s e-mails are held in Taiwan. The originals of
                    the electronic documents are therefore outside jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Plaintiff appears to have operated under
                    the assumption that by providing printed copies of electronic documents for
                    inspection, it would have discharged its obligations to give inspection of the
                    electronic documents. This assumption needs to be examined. The obligation lies
                    on a litigant to provide the best evidence and where the original is available,
                    to produce the original in evidence and, <em>a
                        fortiori</em>, for inspection. <em>Per</em>

                        electronic documents ordered to be discovered are stored. [Emphasis
                        mine.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, where electronic documents are available, inspection should be
                    given of the original and not merely a printed copy. In this case, where e-mails
                    are accessible from either the e-mail servers in Hong Kong or the
                    employees’ personal computer or notebook computer, the originals should be
                    produced for inspection unless there is good reason not to do so. Where
                    authenticity is not disputed, it would not be desirable to incur the costs of
                    inspecting such originals if a reasonable substitute may be given. Such
                    reasonable substitute may have been printed copies in days past, but given the
                    level of technology and connectivity today, the feasibility of providing a soft
                    copy in the native format should be considered in preference to printed
                    copies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     To my mind, the international features of this
                    case lend their weight in favour of ordering electronic discovery. As the
                    originals of the electronic documents are outside jurisdiction, there will be
                    costs involved in producing them for inspection. For e-mails residing on e-mail
                    servers in Hong Kong, arrangements may have to be made for inspection to be
                    carried out by giving reasonable means and assistance pursuant to paragraph
                    43F(1). This may involve providing remote access to the e-mail servers from the
                    Plaintiff’s offices in Singapore. For e-mails residing on personal
                    computers and notebooks of employees, these may have to be brought into
                    Singapore. These options will incur an amount of cost and a degree of
                    inconvenience which, to my mind, may not be necessary at this stage given the
                    nature of the issues which are in dispute. The provision of electronic copies in
                    their native format as part of discovery will kill two birds with one stone. The
                    Defendant will obtain copies of discoverable electronic documents and these will
                    be in native format with minimal alteration, as close to inspection as may be
                    achieved without having to access the e-mail servers in Hong Kong or requiring
                    the employees to produce their personal computers or notebook computers in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Value of claim and financial position of each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Plaintiff’s claim is for USD 1.8
                    million, while the Defendant’s counterclaim is for USD 48 million. The
                    Plaintiff is an international bank and the Defendant, its former private banking
                    customer. Both parties have appointed solicitors in well-resourced firms. I do
                    think that neither the value of the claim nor the financial position of either
                    party get in the way of electronic discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ease and expense of retrieval of electronic documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Plaintiff does not deny that electronic
                    documents exist. The Plaintiff’s main objections lie in the fact that its
                    solicitors had already prepared a draft list of documents for exchange and in so
                    doing, had worked with printed documents provided by the Plaintiff. During
                    submissions, it was clarified that as instructions were given and documents
                    received in either printed form or as scanned <font style="font-variant: small-caps;">pdf</font> documents, the Plaintiff’s solicitors would set
                    discoverable documents aside and maintain a set of such documents in printed
                    form, ready for photocopying for the purpose of giving copies as part of general
                    discovery. To require electronic discovery at this juncture would mean that
                    costs would (in its view) be unjustifiably incurred in the subsequent electronic
                    discovery exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To my mind, the workflow between solicitor and
                    client and how they choose to manage documents passing between them should not
                    be held up as a hurdle to the discovery process. In present times where a
                    significant number of commercial transactions are conducted over e-mails and
                    electronic documents are accepted for commercial transactions (see <em>Joseph Mathew and another v Singh Chiranjeev and another</em>
                    [2010] SLR 338, where the contract to grant an option to purchase land
                    was made over e-mails; and <em>SM Integrated Transware Pte Ltd v
                        Schenker Singapore (Pte) Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 651, where
                    a lease over warehousing space was similarly concluded over e-mails), the fact
                    that solicitor and client chose to print all electronic documents alone, without
                    more, cannot deprive a litigant of his entitlement at law to inspection of the
                    original electronic documents and to take a soft copy. Further, as observed in
                    paragraphs 3–5 and 18–20 above, the Defendant had raised the issue
                    of electronic discovery within the time frame set forth in paragraph 43B of PD
                    3/2009: there was no delay on his part. As such, if there was any party that is
                    at risk of unfair prejudice, it would be the Defendant, if the Plaintiff and its
                    solicitors’ chosen method of managing electronic documents was permitted
                    to become an obstacle to electronic discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Plaintiff further objected to producing
                    e-mails in native format because the Plaintiff and its solicitors were on
                    different e-mail systems. The Plaintiff uses the Lotus Notes e-mail platform
                    while its solicitors use the Microsoft Outlook e-mail platform. In both systems,
                    e-mails are not stored in individual files but in a composite file akin to a
                    miniature database. It is possible to copy selected e-mails (including
                    attachments) into a single composite file for the very purpose of providing
                    copies of these selected e-mails and attachments. The Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors argued that it did not have the software to access the composite
                    files in .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">nsf</font> format produced by Lotus
                    Notes platform used by its clients; and it raised concerns that conversion of
                    composite Lotus Notes e-mail files into Microsoft Outlook’s .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">pst</font> composite file format may lead to the loss
                    of metadata information. In support of these concerns, the Plaintiff relied on
                    two articles downloaded from the Internet and notes of a general telephone
                    inquiry its solicitors had with an electronic discovery service provider. These
                    were subsequently enclosed as exhibits in a supplemental
                affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Defendant had previously, by letter dated
                    16 March 2010, suggested a method of converting a .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">nsf</font> composite Lotus Notes e-mail file to a
                        .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">pst</font> composite Microsoft Outlook
                    e-mail file. In an affidavit filed by Mr Mohamed Musthafa Kalander
                    Mohideen, the Assistant Director of the Defendant’s solicitors’
                    Information Technology department and an IT professional with 16 years
                    experience, detailed steps were laid out to show how this conversion may be
                    carried out without the need for additional software apart from software
                    available as part of the Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook e-mail
                    platforms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Further, I had called for both parties to
                    obtain quotations of the cost of acquiring Lotus Notes software licences so that
                    the Plaintiff’s solicitors may be able to access the .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">nsf</font> files produced by their clients. The
                    Plaintiff’s quote was SGD 721.80 for 5 Lotus Notes e-mail client software
                    licences; the Defendant’s quote was SGD 899 for 10 Lotus Notes e-mail
                    client software licences and 1 Lotus Notes Domino e-mail server licence.
                    Plainly, the cost of acquiring the requisite software in order that the
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors may access the e-mails of their client is not
                    prohibitive, particularly in light of the size of the claim and the financial
                    position of the Plaintiff. Purchasing the requisite licences is probably the
                    most cost efficient means of addressing this disability. Of course, there are
                    lower cost options which the Plaintiff and its solicitors may consider: for
                    example, provision of a notebook with the requisite software by the Plaintiff to
                    its solicitors, or allowing its solicitors access to the Plaintiff’s
                    offices (and workstations) to carry out e-mail review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Before leaving this point, I wish only to make
                    the observations that any difficulties in accessing e-mails produced in the
                    native Lotus Notes .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">nsf</font> format lie with
                    the Plaintiff’s solicitors. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s
                    solicitors use the Lotus Notes e-mail platform and face no such difficulties. I
                    find it unacceptable that Plaintiff’s solicitors should raise objections
                    to electronic discovery that is essentially premised on their (and not the
                    Plaintiff’s) lack of the requisite software programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Balancing the benefits and costs of electronic discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Based on the factors traversed hereinbefore, I
                    am of the view that an order ought to be made for parties to comply with an
                    electronic discovery protocol for the purpose of general discovery and do so
                    order. However, I am mindful of the fact that the Plaintiff has ready a draft
                    list of documents. The question I turn to consider is whether the Plaintiff
                    should be required to provide the categories of documents described as well as
                    conduct a reasonable search based on the key words set out in Part I of the
                    draft electronic discovery protocol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Part I of the draft electronic discovery
                    protocol sets out, <em>inter alia</em>, categories of
                    documents which the Defendant considers to be necessary for disclosure. These
                    categories are described in both the traditional descriptive as well as by
                    reference to a list of search terms and limited to identified servers and
                    storage locations, and by time periods. With this level of candour, had parties
                    taken the exhortation for good faith collaboration in paragraph 43B(1) of PD
                    3/2009 in the right spirit, the time spent in discussing the ambit of general
                    discovery will result in a better understanding of what categories of documents
                    the opposing party considers to be discoverable in this matter. This may avert
                    or reduce subsequent requests and applications for further discovery (if there
                    is agreement or compromise), or at the very least serve to accelerate such
                    applications since parties will know at a fairly early stage their respective
                    positions on entitlement to disputed categories of documents. In either case,
                    there is the potential of saving time and costs in the discovery process. This
                    case is an example of how a draft electronic discovery protocol has, at least on
                    the part of the Defendant, provided the Plaintiff with an insight into the
                    categories of documents which the Defendant considers to be
                discoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Had the Plaintiff responded to the
                    Defendant’s attempt at good faith collaboration in the right spirit, it
                    should have put forward a similar list. Parties could then have worked out an
                    agreement on what will be disclosed during general discovery and the categories
                    for which it will object to disclosure. In a suitable case with voluminous
                    electronic documents, parties may even agree to conduct general discovery
                        <em>in stages</em> by, for example, using agreed sets
                    of keywords to conduct reasonable searches on the e-mails, computers or
                    notebooks of a group of identified persons whom parties consider to be central
                    to the issues in dispute. After disclosure has been given of electronic
                    documents identified in this stage, parties may then explore the extent of
                    discovery which may be required in subsequent stages. A handy summary of
                    discovery in stages is provided by the Senior Master Whitaker in <em>Goodale &amp; Ors v The Ministry of Justice &amp; Ors</em>
                    [2009] EWHC B41 (QB), at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am quite content that the four key witnesses that have been named by the
                        claimants are the right people whose ESI needs to be searched. Numerous
                        other witnesses and custodians of documents have been mentioned but in a
                        case like this, I do not think that searching the ESI of all of them
                        immediately is the right way to go about this exercise. In terms of a search
                        one should always start with the most important people at the top of the
                        pyramid, that is, adopt a staged or incremental approach. Very often an
                        opposing party will get everything they want from that without having to go
                        down the pyramid any further, often into duplicate material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unfortunately, there was no attempt to collaborate on this aspect of
                    the electronic discovery protocol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Had the volume of documents in this case been
                    larger or had the Plaintiff been less ready (and a draft list of document not
                    already been prepared), I would not have hesitated to order that parties comply
                    with the draft electronic discovery protocol in full. However, since the
                    Plaintiff is ready with its list of documents I do not see any benefit in
                    throwing away legal costs already incurred in its preparation. Hence, I order
                    that the draft electronic discovery protocol be modified by deleting Part I. The
                    Plaintiff can proceed to make soft copies of electronic documents which have
                    already been enumerated in its draft list of documents. This should be a fairly
                    straight forward “drag and drop” exercise of making electronic
                    copies of the electronic documents already enumerated in the Plaintiff’s
                    draft list of documents since there are no issues relating to the alteration of
                    the contents of electronic documents or their metadata information based on the
                    pleadings as they stand now. However, this is not to say that the Plaintiff is,
                    by virtue only of this order, released from its common law duty to ensure that
                    the original electronic documents are not intentionally destroyed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I further order that the e-mails (including
                    attachments) to be given in discovery by the Plaintiff be disclosed and soft
                    copies provided in Lotus Notes’ native .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">nsf</font> format in <em>a single composite file for
                        each mailbox</em>. As provision of the soft copy documents in native
                    format provides the party entitled to disclosure with perfect copies of the
                    originals, I do not think that inspection should generally not be required
                    during general discovery unless authenticity is disputed. The international
                    dimension of this case with the original electronic documents situated in Hong
                    Kong and Taiwan makes inspection of originals a practical difficulty and, based
                    on the pleaded case of parties, unnecessary at this stage for the saving of
                    costs, especially since soft copies will be provided in native format. I
                    therefore order that the provision of soft copies of discoverable electronic
                    documents shall be in lieu of inspection. However, should inspection of an
                    original electronic document become necessary at a later stage, this order shall
                    not prevent the party seeking inspection from making a request for inspection
                    subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In paragraph 2 of Part II of the draft

                            attachment to another document. This field will state the Document
                            identifier of the document to which it is attached.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As the volume of electronic documents in this
                    case is not so large as to require an extensive set of metadata information
                    about the discoverable documents, I do not think that the Plaintiff should be
                    required to provide all the metadata information listed above. For the purpose
                    of saving costs, I think that in this case it is appropriate that minimal
                    additional information be added to the draft list of documents. In particular,
                    since the Plaintiff already has a draft list of documents ready, I presume that
                    it has already removed duplicate entries from the list and hence the hash value
                    of each electronic document is unnecessary. Similarly, in the interest of
                    reducing the additional costs which will be incurred in finalising the list, and
                    since the electronic documents to be disclosed are not voluminous, there is also
                    no need for the list to contain information relating to their original location.
                    As I am ordering that e-mails be provided in native format with attachments in a
                    single composite file for each mailbox, there is also no need for host
                    information: this is more suited in a scenario where attachments are provided as
                    separate files from the underlying e-mail, which may arise where, for example,
                    e-mails are printed to .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">pdf</font> format and
                    e-mail and attachments are then disclosed as separate .<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">pdf</font> files. Therefore, I order that the draft
                    electronic discovery protocol be modified by removing from paragraph 2 of Part
                    II, sub-paragraphs (b), (c), (g), (h) and (k). Since sub-paragraphs (b) and (c)
                    are ordered to be removed, they should be substituted with a column for the date
                    of the electronic documents which is presumably already in the existing draft
                    list of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I therefore grant an order in terms of the
                    Defendant’s application with the attached draft electronic discovery
                    protocol modified to the extent set out above; that copies of electronic
                    documents be provided in their native format at the same time as the exchange of
                    the list of documents; and that provision of electronic copies be in lieu of
                    inspection of the original electronic documents in the Plaintiff’s
                    possession, custody or power, except that this order shall not prevent the
                    Defendant from making a request for inspection at a later stage should
                    inspection become necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Defendant has provided in good faith an
                    insight into the categories of documents which he considers to be discoverable
                    for this matter in Part I of the draft electronic discovery protocol. In order
                    to save time and costs, the Plaintiff should have these categories of documents
                    in mind as it finalises the draft list of documents for exchange: categories of
                    documents which it will disclose should be included in the final list of
                    documents and categories which it disputes should be identified early. This is
                    intended to accelerate any potential application for further discovery of
                    disputed categories of documents. I therefore <em>further
                        order</em> that Part I of the draft electronic discovery protocol do
                    stand as the Defendant’s written request for further discovery to which
                    the Plaintiff shall provide a written response at the same time as the exchange
                    of lists of documents and copies of discoverable documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Defendant had submitted that costs be
                    awarded to him on an indemnity basis. Having reviewed the correspondence between
                    parties and the court’s record of discussions during PTCs, I do not think
                    that the Plaintiff’s conduct warrants a costs order on an indemnity basis.
                    The Plaintiff had stated early on that it did not think that electronic
                    discovery was appropriate and had requested that a formal application be taken
                    out. Despite such reservations, the Plaintiff did make some effort to
                    collaborate but, given its misgivings, these fell far short of good faith
                    efforts. Much of the discussion between parties centred on the difficulties of
                    providing copies of the Plaintiff’s e-mails in native format, and there
                    was little progress beyond this issue. I therefore decline to order costs on an
                    indemnity basis and do fix costs at $1,600 plus reasonable disbursements to be
                    paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant forthwith.</p>
