The loan was extended by the second plaintiff, Supreme Star Investments Ltd (“SSI”), in 2016. In 2018, SSI assigned the loan to AAI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendants do not dispute receipt of the loan amount and making certain repayments. They resist the claim on numerous grounds. That said, a core aspect of the pleaded defence – that the loan is a personal loan to Mr Soh, and not a corporate loan to Asidokona – was not pursued at the trial. With this late change in position, many factual disputes fall away. Specifically, allegations attacking AAI’s witnesses for forcing Mr Soh into accepting a last-minute increase to the interest rate, and of forgery and fabrication of the corporate loan and personal guarantee documents (after Mr Soh allegedly signed on blank pages merely to effect the personal loan to him), are abandoned. None of AAI’s witnesses were cross-examined on such matters. Instead, at the close of AAI’s case, the defendants submitted that there is no case to answer and elected not to adduce any evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence before me, I grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff.

In particular, the defendants aver that, at all times, the loan was meant to be personal to Mr Soh at an interest rate of 3% per month. Mr Ong and Mr Wong, who were present at the meeting at JLC Advisors on 22 July 2016, essentially compelled Mr Soh to agree to an increase of the interest rate from 3% to 5% per month. Due to his urgent need for funds, Mr Soh agreed. Further, as Mr Soh was informed by a female staff that the agreements were not ready for his perusal, out of trust, he signed off on blank pages.

This was the common understanding among Mr Wong, Mr Soh and Mr Ong. According to Mr Wong, in accordance with cl 2 read with Item 3 of Schedule 1, Asidokona was granted an extension of the loan by a further three months to 21 January 2017. Thereafter, Mr Wong alleged that Asidokona unilaterally extended the loan on multiple occasions.

As the loan was referred to SSI by Mr Wong, Mr Wong decided to arrange for AAI to take over the loan from SSI to “manage the direction forward in recovering the loan debt”. Since Mr Wong had personally invested moneys to fund the loan for Asidokona and Mr Yong had indirectly contributed to the loan (as mentioned at [20] above), both Mr Yong and Mr Wong have an interest in the repayment of the loan. Thus, Mr Yong and Mr Wong decided that their company, AAI, would be the assignee of the Loan Agreement, Personal Guarantee and Deed of Charge. In that respect, Mr Wong “irrevocably assigned [his] interest of S$1,000,000 from SSI to AAI”. The arrangement pursuant to the assignment was that after the payment of costs, any sums recovered from the present proceedings are to be repaid to AAI and SSI in equal proportions. Thus, there is “no avenue for AAI to profit from these proceedings”.

At this juncture, I set out the legal principles where the defendants submit that there is no case to answer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In relation to any cause of action pleaded by the plaintiff, the legal burden of proof lies on the plaintiff, and will only be discharged if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has proved its pleaded case against the defendant on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is, however, always open to a defendant, having heard the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff, to elect to call no evidence on the basis that the evidence put forth by the plaintiff is insufficient to transfer the evidential burden onto the defendant so that the plaintiff has failed to prove its case. Hence the expression, “no case to answer” (O 35 r 4(3) and O 110 r 3(1) of the ROC). While the legal burden rests on the plaintiff throughout the proceedings as the party making the claim against the defendant, the evidential burden can shift as the civil trial progresses. That evidential burden rests on the party on whom the responsibility lies to contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence that has been led (<span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2021] 1 SLR 304 (“<span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin</span>”) at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Crucially, the establishment of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case by the plaintiff on a particular point on which it bears the legal burden denotes the point at which the evidential burden will shift to the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin </span>at [30]). Following any shift in evidential burden<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the point that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case against the defendant is established, the plaintiff would have succeeded in proving the case on a <span class="font-italic">balance of probabilities </span>since there is simply no evidence forthcoming from the defendant to disprove the plaintiff’s position or otherwise weaken the case against it (<span class="font-italic">Ma Hongjin </span>at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The <span class="font-italic">threshold</span> to succeed on a “no case to answer” submission is a <span class="font-italic">high </span>one. In <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo</span> [2015] 1 SLR 581 at [23]–[24], the Court of Appeal held that it is established law that a submission of “no case to answer” will only succeed if the evidence led by the plaintiff, at face value, does not establish a case in law or is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proof. If circumstantial evidence is relied on, it does not have to give rise to an irresistible inference as long as the desired inference is one of the possible inferences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Bearing in mind the foregoing applicable principles, I turn to consider the issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether AAI, as an equitable assignee, may proceed with the action against the defendants when SSI, the equitable assignor, is no longer a party</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I turn to address the <span class="font-italic">Locus Standi </span>Defence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Based on the parties’ arguments, the issue is whether the claim of an equitable assignee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, AAI) against the obligor(s) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Asidokona and Mr Soh) fails because the equitable assignor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SSI) is no longer a party to the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The starting point is <span class="font-italic">Parkway</span>, where Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held that the argument that “the assignee cannot sue in his own name and the assignor must be made a co-plaintiff” is a valid one (at [12]–[13]). Nonetheless, Prakash J granted an application to add the assignor as the second plaintiff “as “<span class="font-italic">the</span> <span class="font-italic">problem was a technical one which could have easily been averted</span> <span class="font-italic">had notice of the assignment been given</span> to the [obligor] before the commencement of the action <span class="font-italic">or</span> <span class="font-italic">had [the equitable assignor] been made a co-plaintiff</span> at the beginning” [emphasis added in italics] (at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd and another v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2014] SGHC 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Total English</span>”), Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) observed, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that “an equitable assignment would <span class="font-italic">generally</span> require the assignee to join the assignor to the action” [emphasis added] (at [51]). Then, in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale</span>, Lai Siu Chiu J (as she then was) made similar remarks. In particular, Lai J held that one rationale for the requirement of recovering a debt in the name of the equitable assignor is “to protect the debtor from being exposed to double action for the same debt” (at [49]) and that the statutory assignment was created under s 4(8) of the CLA to “counter this procedural bar of having to add the assignor as a party to the action to recover the debt” (at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 One consistent point made by the cases is that the requirement of joining an equitable assignor as a co-plaintiff is a procedural requirement. Indeed, this is common ground between AAI and the defendants. The reason is to protect the obligor from the risk of double recovery (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by the equitable assignor and equitable assignee alike) arising from essentially the same obligation. In that sense, the rationale for such procedural requirement is both practical and protective of the interests of all the parties involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Given that this is a procedural requirement, it seems to me that the court may dispense with it altogether in the appropriate circumstances. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2019) at para 80.446, it is stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although actions founded on an assignment in equity <span class="font-italic">may no longer have to be brought in the name of the assignor</span>, the assignor may still have to be joined in the action, as co-plaintiff if he is willing to co-operate, and as co-defendant if not. … Even though the courts are now fused, a court hearing the issue would require that the assignor be joined so that it is bound by the judgment given in favour of the assignee. <span class="font-italic">Without this procedural requirement, the debtor could subsequently still be sued by the assignor of the legal chose in action</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… However, the need for joinder may be <span class="font-italic">waived</span> by the debtor or <span class="font-italic">by the court</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Similarly, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed) at 3–023 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This requirement is <span class="font-italic">only procedural</span> however and proceedings will not be treated as a nullity where the assignor and assignee are not both joined. The court may at any stage remedy the defect by ordering that a party be added as a party. <span class="font-italic">In special circumstances (e.g. where it is clear that the assignor has no further interest in the matter), the court may even dispense with the requirement that both assignor and assignee are joined</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">Yongnam</span>, the court likewise accepted that “the court has a discretion to dispense with the requirement that both assignor and assignee be joined as parties” at [68], referring to the same excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>reproduced above. However, as the defendants highlighted, the court in that case declined to exercise its discretion in the circumstances of that case. In my judgment, even if SSI is no longer a party to the action, the totality of the circumstances would, unlike the case in <span class="font-italic">Yongnam</span>, justify the exercise of discretion in favour of AAI for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 First, AAI had in fact added SSI as co-plaintiff to the action. Second, while SSI has not chosen to participate in these proceedings after it was restored to the BVI Register of Companies, SSI has “adopted and ratified” the Loan Agreement, Personal Guarantee, Deed of Charge, Deeds of Assignments, and the commencement of the action by AAI.

</div> Thus, I accept that the action is determinative of the subject matter of this action such that SSI cannot bring a fresh suit in respect of the same. There is no risk of double recovery in the circumstances. Fourth, the defendants’ defences (or lack thereof in respect of failing to repay AAI or SSI, as mentioned at [57]) would not change (whether or not SSI is a party to the action). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Indeed, I find the remarks of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Performing Right Society Ltd v London Theatre of Varieties Ltd</span> [1924] AC 1 particularly helpful and applicable. Lord Sumner remarked (at p 31):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the assignor … was not made a party, he would not be bound; was it not possible that the debtors … might be exposed to claims by him or his trustee in bankruptcy? [The assignor], however, had already been settled with and the [debtors] held his receipt. … <span class="font-italic">The respondents admitted that what they wanted was not the presence but the absence of the assignor, and that they did not propose to pay the assignor but desired to pay nobody, and this mere non-joinder of parties was not allowed to relieve them</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Likewise in the present case, the defendants in effect seek the absence of SSI and thereby deny liability for the repayment of the loan. In such circumstances, the defendants should not be allowed to succeed on the <span class="font-italic">Locus Standi </span>Defence and thereby escape any liability entirely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Before I leave this issue, I should add that in the first place, I have some reservations about the parties’ position that SSI is no longer a party to the action. Pursuant to AAI’s application made under O 15 r 6 of the ROC, SSI was joined as a party on 7 February 2019 (see [42] above). There has not been any specific order for SSI to cease being a party. If SSI has “for any reason ceased to be a proper or necessary party” to the action, such an order can be sought and made under O 15 r 6 of the ROC. Certainly, no such order has been made and counsel for the parties confirmed that no such order had been sought. In my view, the effect of the striking out of the action is not that SSI is removed as a party. SSI is simply unable to proceed with the action. However, from the time of the joinder, SSI did not seek any relief under the Statement of Claim. Its presence was, and is, for the purpose of satisfying the technical requirement so that SSI’s action may be sustained. Notwithstanding the subsequent developments, it seems to me that the procedural requirement has been met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Be that as it may, I have dealt with the arguments as raised by the parties. By all of the above, I find that AAI is able to sustain the claim against the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether SSI authorised the Loan Agreement and Deeds of Assignments and whether the Ratification is valid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Lack of Authority and Invalid Ratification Defences are related, and I propose to deal with the Invalid Ratification Defence first. Specifically, even if the defendants could prove on the evidence that Mr Wong and Mr Ong lacked the requisite authority at all material times, the argument would be moot if the Ratification is valid. Indeed, it bears reminding that it was subsequent to Ms Lou’s unexpected stance on the loan that the defendants mounted challenges regarding the authority of Mr Wong and Mr Ong to act for SSI. These were contained in the third and fourth rounds of amendments to their Defences. In response, SSI ratified the various matters. Thereafter, the defendants plead in the Rejoinders that the Ratification is not valid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendants allege that any ratification (of the Loan Agreement, Personal Guarantee, Deed of Charge, and Deeds of Assignments) is invalid as: (a) SSI did not have full knowledge of the material facts pertaining to the unauthorised actions of Mr Wong at the time of the Ratification; (b) the Ratification did not take place within reasonable time and thus would unfairly prejudice the defendants; and (c) AAI should not be allowed to rely on the Ratification as it has acted in abuse of process.

</div> The defendants submit that the Ratification is an abuse of process because “despite knowing from the very outset of the identity of SSI’s sole director and shareholder and his lack of authority to act on behalf of SSI, [Mr Wong] deliberately concealed the above material facts from the Court” throughout the pre-trial hearings. As early as AAI’s first amendment on 8 February 2019, when SSI was added as the second plaintiff, AAI pleaded that the “authorised Attorney for SSI is [Mr Wong]”.

In that regard, ratification “is akin to an assent by the principal to the transaction entered into by the unauthorised agent by adopting the agent’s otherwise unauthorised acts” (<span class="font-italic">Cavenagh Investment Pte Ltd v Kaushik Rajiv</span> [2013] 2 SLR 543 at [31]). This is to say that if the Ratification is valid, SSI will be accordingly bound by the acts of Mr Wong and Mr Ong. In that regard, and as mentioned at [80], any lack of authority on the part of Mr Wong and Mr Ong to act on behalf of SSI as alleged by the defendant would be of no legal significance if their acts were so ratified by SSI. Significantly, the defendants’ Lack of Authority Defence would also fall away. The parties’ disagreements on this issue turn on the facts, to which I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, I am not convinced that SSI did not have full knowledge of the material facts pertaining to the unauthorised actions of Mr Wong at the time of the Ratification (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 26 July 2021) as the defendants submit.

</div> If that is so, it cannot be seriously disputed that by March 2020 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when there was the WhatsApp exchange between Mr Wong and Ms Lou as set out at [45]–[46] above), Ms Lou had full knowledge of the material facts on which Mr Wong and Mr Soh had acted. That same WhatsApp message by Mr Wong also confirmed that lawyers were on board to determine how Ms Lou could help Mr Wong in the action. The defendants’ submission is thus a mere afterthought that is, in any case, contrary to their own pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The second allegation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Ratification was not made within a reasonable period of time) is also linked to the first allegation. The defendants plead that, despite Ms Lou’s knowledge of the action from as early as March 2020 and that SSI’s action had been struck off in March 2021, it was only on 26 July 2021 that the Ratification was made. At first blush, there appears to be a considerable lapse in time. However, all of the circumstances must be borne in mind in determining the question. It is undisputed that SSI was struck off the BVI Register of Companies on 1 November 2019 (as mentioned at [5]) and was restored to the same only on 23 July 2021. Thus, the Resolution was passed a mere three days after it was restored to the BVI Register of Companies.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Seen in that light, the Ratification can hardly be said not to have been made within a reasonable time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Thirdly, I disagree that the Ratification is an abuse of process. As mentioned at [81], the defendant’s complaint is essentially that Mr Wong had represented himself to be SSI’s authorised agent despite knowing that he was not (thus misleading the court). In my judgment, such a factual submission is not supported by the evidence. As described at [45] above, having set out the background of matters to Ms Lou, Mr Wong explained in his WhatsApp message of 21 March 2020 to Ms Lou that he only found out that Ms Lou was the sole owner and director of SSI during the assignment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, March 2018). Mr Wong has consistently maintained that position (see [27]). In that regard, Mr Wong candidly admitted in his WhatsApp message that he had “trusted [Mr Ong] too much and relied on his representations”. In relation to the authority to act for SSI, Mr Wong testified:

Ms Lou’s answers to interrogatories were that “SSI did not place a sum of S$1,700,000 in M/s JLC Advisors LLP’s client account at the material time” and that “SSI never owned or beneficially owned a pool of funds in JLC Advisors’ client account” (see [51] above).

</div> In my judgment, this is a crucial fact which suggests that the S$1m was transferred out of the JLC Advisors’ client account. Based on the totality of Ms Lou’s evidence before me, a reasonable inference to be drawn is that the S$1m was used to finance part of the loan to Asidokona pursuant to the Loan Agreement. Furthermore, such inference is supported by other corroborative evidence such as Mr Wong’s WhatsApp message to Ms Lou on 21 March 2020 wherein Mr Wong stated that Mr William Wong confirmed that “SSI [had] the funds to do the loan (in July 2016)” (see [45] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Thus, taking the defendants’ case at its very highest, even if Ms Lou had transferred S$1m from SSI’s account to JLC Advisors’ client account at the instruction of Mr William Wong without knowing the purpose of such transfer, I am satisfied that the money was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> used to finance the loan to Asidokona. However, I also note that, if<span class="font-italic"> </span>it is true that Ms Lou was completely oblivious as to the purpose of the remittance (which itself is doubtful based on her testimony), one might argue that this would result in the question of whether SSI’s funds in the JLC Advisors’ client account were otherwise misused.

By the Deed of Undertaking, AAI, SSI and Ms Lou agreed that upon a successful recovery of the sum by AAI from Asidokona and/or Mr Soh in the action, the sum shall first be used to reimburse AAI for all of its costs and expenses. The remaining balance shall be shared equally by AAI and SSI (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in a 50:50 split). As pointed out by AAI, there is “nothing sinister in AAI’s transfer of half of the monies recovered in the [action] to SSI”.

The first is “whether there was a certain degree of system and continuity in the transactions” (the “Continuity Test”) and, if the answer is no, then the second is whether the alleged moneylender is one who is ready and willing to lend to all and sundry provided that they are from his point of view eligible” (the “All and Sundry Test”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 As set out at [37] above, the Illegal Moneylending Defence relied on particulars which essentially alleged that the loan was <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>made to Mr Soh personally.

</div> Therefore, SSI was not an “excluded moneylender”. At the trial, counsel for the defendants confirmed that they were no longer pursuing the defence that the loan was made to Mr Soh in his personal capacity. Nonetheless, the defendants maintain their position that the presumption under s 3 of the MLA that SSI is a moneylender applies in the present case as the “amount to be allegedly repaid” by the defendants “far exceeds the alleged loan amount”.

</div> Thereafter, the pertinent issue is whether SSI is an “excluded moneylender” under the MLA. If so, then it does not matter whether SSI could be said to be a moneylender carrying out a business of moneylending in Singapore. Consequently, s 19(3) of the MLA would likewise not apply so as to render the contract, the guarantee, and the security for the loan unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 On the evidence before me, SSI’s loan in the present case is extended only to a corporation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Asidokona, which is a company registered in Singapore). As such, the evidence points to SSI falling squarely within the definition of an “excluded moneylender”. To reiterate, the defendants have abandoned their initial allegation that the loan is made to Mr Soh personally and not to Asidokona. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>, the legal burden of proving that SSI is not an excluded moneylender falls on the defendants. In my judgment, the defendants fall far short of doing so. In fact, the defendants do not address the question of whether SSI falls within the definition of an excluded moneylender under s 2(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii)(A) of the MLA at all. Instead, the defendants submit that there were “suspicious and dubious circumstances” surrounding the loan which “points towards an illegal moneylending transaction” such as: (a) Ms Lou denying that SSI entered into the loan transaction or disbursed any moneys; (b) Mr Ong using “SSI as a front to funnel illegal [moneys] from JLC Advisors’ account”; (c) that the <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>adopted by Mr Ong was “similarly also adopted in at least one other case which has been disclosed in the course of the proceedings”; and (d) the interest rates imposed are “exorbitant”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In my judgment, none of these factors were relevant in determining the crucial issue of whether SSI is an “excluded moneylender” under the MLA. I elaborate. As regards Ms Lou’s initial denial, I have already dealt with the same factual contention in respect of the Illegality Defence and the Ratification Issue above and need not say more. The defendants’ related allegation that Mr Ong used SSI as a front to funnel moneys from the JLC Advisors’ account thus also falls away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Further, Mr Ong’s evidence does not support the contention that there was a <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>whereby SSI was used as a front for an organised scheme of moneylending. Taken in context, Mr Ong simply mentioned that Mr William Wong and Ms Lou “regularly appointed JLC Advisors to act for them and/or their many offshore corporate entities in various commercial deals”.

</div> In any event, the “one other case” uncovered in the proceedings which is an alleged loan between SSI and JC Global. Again, this alleged loan was to a corporation, and did not take SSI outside the ambit of “excluded moneylender”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Finally, the interest rate does not aid the defendants’ case any further. While there might be some link between the contractual interest rate in establishing whether SSI is a moneylender, it is altogether unhelpful in dealing with the issue of whether SSI is an excluded moneylender.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Thus, I reiterate that the defendants fail to discharge their burden of proof and I accept that SSI is an “excluded moneylender” under the MLA. This is sufficient to dispose of the defendants’ Illegal Moneylending Defence. Nevertheless, I note that Quentin Loh J (as he then was) made a short remark in <span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>leaving open the question of whether the excluded moneylender exception would always apply if the borrower is a corporation (at [139(b)]). In this regard, Loh J commented:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the [Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed)] introduced a new concept of “excluded moneylender” which is defined, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, as a party who lends money solely to corporations: s 2(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii)(A). … If a literal interpretation of the Moneylenders Act is taken, even if the transaction was in substance a loan to the [Ridout Residence Pte Ltd], [E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd] would be an “excluded moneylender” under the Moneylenders Act. The result would be the same if a purposive interpretation was adopted. <span class="font-italic">However I must not be taken to say that so long as a borrower is a corporation, no matter what the circumstances or nature of shareholding, the excluded moneylender exception would apply</span>. <span class="font-italic">Depending on the facts and circumstances, it may</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In my view, Loh J<span class="font-italic"> </span>was careful to express that <span class="font-italic">E C Investment </span>should not be interpreted to stand for the proposition that the “excluded moneylender” exception would necessarily always apply so long as a borrower is a corporation no matter what the circumstances or the nature of the shareholding. The opposite, however, must also be true in that <span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span> does not set out any further requirements in addition to that set out under the MLA which must be satisfied before a person may be considered to be an “excluded moneylender” under the MLA. Indeed, Loh J’s holding was precisely that the loan in that case was made to a corporation such that the plaintiff was an “excluded moneylender”. In that regard, reading Loh J’s remarks in context, <span class="font-italic">E C Investment </span>should be understood as an expression of caution – the court should consider the substance of the loan in question (for example, by considering “the circumstances or nature of shareholding”) to consider who the actual borrower of the particular loan in question is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In any case, the issue does not arise here since the defendants have abandoned their allegation that the loan was <span class="font-italic">de facto </span>made to Mr Soh and not Asidokona.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Again, the defendants’ position is not legally tenable since the burden of proof falls on the defendants (see [131(b)]). I note that Mr Soh is an experienced banker and businessman. From the communications produced before me, when he entered into the Loan Agreement, Mr Soh was well aware of the applicable interest rates. Once again, I reiterate that Mr Soh has dropped his allegations that the bargaining process was imbalanced, he was pressured into accepting the high interest rates, and that the interest rate was meant to be 3% per month. Certainly, it is not for the court to question the commercial decision made by parties. It could be that, depending on the totality of the circumstances (such as the principal sum concerned, the urgency of the loan, and the type and nature of security for the loan, if any), such a default interest clause with such a default interest rate may amount to a penalty clause. Indeed, I note that in <span class="font-italic">E C Investment, </span>the loan of S$1.5m for 60 days was secured by real property worth S$29m, and it was in view of such circumstances that Loh J found the interest on the loan at 6% per month “can be considered extortionate or usurious” (at [138]). Here, the short-term loan was secured only by Mr Soh’s personal guarantee, and Mr Soh’s shares in Asidokona which is a private company incorporated a year prior to the loan. The defendants have simply failed to adduce evidence to show that the interest rate of 6% per month (which is 1% above the applicable interest rate of 5% per month) is extravagant and unconscionable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commencement of default interest </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Having found that the default interest clause is valid and enforceable, a further issue arises as to when default interest should start running. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 According to Mr Wong, as at 5 March 2020, the balance sum due under the Loan Agreement (deducting the payments already made of S$900,000) as set out at [23] above is calculated to be as follows:

However, I note that at paragraphs 11, 14 and 15 of the Amended Statement of Claim, AAI states that the parties agreed to three extensions of the Loan Agreement until 21 January 2017, 31 August 2017 and 30 September 2017 respectively. For each of these extensions, AAI pleads that the loan may be extended thereafter on a month-to-month basis at the discretion of AAI. At paragraph 19 of the Amended Statement of Claim, AAI pleads that “[a]s a result of the repeated delays and failure on the part of the [d]efendants to repay the Loan, SSI was not agreeable to any further extension of the Loan beyond March 2018”.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In response, the defendants plead that in any event, the default interest should only take effect after March 2018.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Oral Submissions of 14 February 2022. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In my view, AAI cannot claim what has not been clearly and consistently pleaded. Despite the table after paragraph 22 of the Amended Statement of Claim setting out the calculation of default interest from 22 June 2017, the other paragraphs state AAI’s position to be that the Loan Agreement was extended to the end of March 2018 (apparently on the same basis as the very first extension to 21 January 2017 – which AAI does not dispute is based on the interest rate of 5% per month). Indeed, AAI does not plead that the second and third extensions were on terms different from the first extension. Further, from Mr Soh’s WhatsApp messages set out at [22] above, it appears to me that the parties’ understanding was that such extensions on a month-to-month basis would be based on the interest of $100,000 per month, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>interest of 5% per month and not default interest of 6% per month. Therefore, I am of the view that default interest should only run from 1 April 2018. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 To conclude, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that AAI has proven its case against both defendants. I am also of the view that the defendants’ grounds for disputing the claim are not made out on the law and evidence before me. As such, I grant judgment in favour of AAI against the defendants for the principal amount of the loan of S$2m, with interest payable under cl 6.1 of the Loan Agreement at 5% per month to be calculated from 22 July 2016 to end March 2018, and default interest under cl 7.1 of the Loan Agreement at 6% per month from 1 April 2018 to date of payment. AAI is to give credit to the defendants for payment of the sum of S$900,000 which I accept to be made towards the interest on the Loan Agreement only (and not the principal amount). In my judgment, it is plain from the objective contemporary communications from Mr Soh to Mr Wong that the money set aside (being the initial sum of S$300,000) and subsequent payments of S$900,000 were intended for the payment of interest (see [12] and [22] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Pursuant to cl 4 of the Deed of Charge, Mr Soh is also to deliver to AAI (a) all share certificates representing the Charged Shares; (b) two share transfer forms duly executed in respect of the Charged Shares; and (c) a certified true copy of the Register of Members of Asidokona duly annotated by the company secretary of Asidokona to note that the Charged Shares are the subject of a charge in favour of AAI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In relation to costs, AAI submits that the defendants should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis for two reasons. First, it is contractually provided for at cl 10 of the Loan Agreement, as well as cl 2.1 of the Personal Guarantee. Second, this is an appropriate course for the present case given the defendants’ conduct of pursuing an entirely unmeritorious defence.

</div>

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Where there is a contractual agreement between parties prescribing that, in the event of a dispute, legal costs are to be paid by one party to another on an indemnity basis, the court “must have the power to override the parties’ agreement as to costs in order to preserve the integrity of the administration of justice” such that “where the claim for costs on the basis of a contractual provision is manifestly unjust, the court can and should intervene to disallow the claim in the exercise of its discretion” (<span class="font-italic">Abani Trading Pte Ltd v BNP Paribas and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 909 (“<span class="font-italic">Abani</span>”) at [93]). In that regard, “in the absence of manifest injustice, the court will tend towards upholding the contractual bargain entered into by both parties” (<span class="font-italic">Abani</span> at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 On all the circumstances of the present case, I see no reason to depart from the contractual agreement that the defendants pay costs on an indemnity basis. No “manifest injustice” can be said to arise in the circumstances to justify the court exercising its discretion to override the parties’ agreement for indemnity costs. Such costs order should be unsurprising, given that the defendants had agreed to indemnity costs under the Loan Agreement and the Personal Guarantee. This is sufficient to dispose of the defendants’ objection to paying costs on an indemnity basis. Nevertheless, since both parties also submitted on the defendants’ conduct, I make the following remarks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 This should have been a straightforward claim for the recovery of the loan. To support the Illegal Moneylending Defence, the defendants made many bare allegations contrary to the objective contemporaneous evidence, including unwarranted and unnecessary allegations against Ms Pok. In particular, the allegation that Mr Soh signed blank pages flies in the face of clear WhatsApp messages and emails exchanged at the material time. Indeed, the communications clearly show that at all material times, Mr Soh was fully aware that the loan was meant to be granted to Asidokona, with Mr Soh as the guarantor. Having made these unsubstantiated allegations, Mr Soh elected (unsurprisingly) not to testify to substantiate his assertions. Further, after Mr Ong’s legal troubles in 2019, Ms Lou began distancing herself from the loan transaction. In my view, the defendants capitalised on the situation and introduced a number of unmeritorious defences so as to evade liability. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in awarding costs to AAI on an indemnity basis against the defendants. Such costs are to be taxed (if not agreed).  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> Narayanan Sreenivasan SC, Rajaram Muralli Raja and Tan Si Xin Adorabelle (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mulani Prakash P and Ruelia Nesaranjini d/o Ravindran Rufus </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(M &amp; A Law Corporation) for the first and second defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
