<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff as registered mortgagee
                    (“the Bank”) of the <em>Turtle Bay</em> and
                    the <em>Tampa Bay</em> commenced Admiralty in Rem
                    Nos 37 and 44 of 2013 (collectively, “the ADM Actions”) and
                    arrested the <em>Turtle Bay</em> and the <em>Tampa Bay</em> (collectively, “the Vessels”) in
                    Singapore on 29 January 2013 and 5 February 2013 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The ADM Actions were commenced after the
                    defendant shipowner had gone into liquidation in Germany. I should imagine that
                    the effect of the defendant’s insolvency on the ADM Actions would be
                    governed by German insolvency law. As to whether there were any insolvency
                    issues arising under German law from the defendant’s liquidation, none
                    were identified and explained in the Bank’s affidavits. The principles in
                        <em>In re Aro</em> [1980] Ch 196 followed in <em>The Oriental Baltic</em> [2011] 3 SLR 487, <em>The Hull 308</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 643 and <em>The
                        Convenience Container</em> [2007] 4 HKLRD 575 that deal with the
                    commencement of <em>in rem</em> proceedings either before
                    and after the insolvency of a defendant came to mind, and I had wondered whether
                    those cases differed from the facts of the present case before me. Be that as it
                    may, in the affidavits supporting the arrest of the Vessels, the Bank disclosed
                    that the German insolvency administrator was aware of the Bank’s intention
                    to enforce the mortgages and gave written consent to the direct sale of the
                    Vessels which the Bank intended “to carry out after arresting the
                        [Vessels]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It was not surprising that with the liquidation
                    of the defendant shipowner, no appearance was entered by the latter to the ADM
                    Actions. The Bank duly filed two applications for default judgment (one for each
                    of the Vessels) on 26 February 2013. On the same day, the Bank separately
                    applied for a sale of each of the Vessels (together, “the Sanction
                    Applications”). By prayer 1(a) of both the Sanction Applications, the
                    Bank sought the court’s approval or confirmation of a private direct sale
                    of the <em>Turtle Bay</em> and the <em>Tampa
                        Bay</em> on the terms of two contracts dated 5 February 2013 and 9
                    February 2013 respectively (<em>ie</em>, after the arrest
                    of each Vessel) that were entered between the Bank and a named buyer for a
                    specified price each (“the Direct Private Sale”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On 26 February
                    2013, the Bank was seeking judicial approval of a private sale <em>pendente lite</em>, but that was no longer the position after
                    default judgment was obtained on 15 March 2013. Strictly speaking, the Sanction
                    Applications were for orders approving the Direct Private Sale after
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sanction Applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Sanction Applications were initially listed
                    for hearing on 15 March 2013, but they were adjourned for the Bank’s
                    lawyers to conduct further research on the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the adjourned hearing on 5 April 2013,
                    counsel for the Bank, Mr Mark Tan (“Mr Tan”) sought to justify the
                    Bank’s case by distinguishing the steps taken by the Bank to arrange the
                    Direct Private Sale from the settled proposition of law that any attempt to
                    arrange a private sale of an arrested vessel after the court has commissioned
                    the Sheriff to appraise and sell the vessel constituted contempt of court
                        (<em>The APJ Shalin</em> [1991] Lloyd’s Rep 62;
                        <em>The Jarvis Brake</em> [1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep
                    320).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I did not accept this distinction as a proper
                    justification. Although a party is clearly in contempt of court if it arranges a
                    private sale after the court commissions the Sheriff to sell a vessel, it does
                    not necessarily follow that this party is <em>never</em> in
                    contempt of court if it arranges a direct sale before the court so commissions
                    the Sheriff. Much depends on the circumstances of the case. For instance, a sale
                    could potentially constitute contempt of court in the light of evidence that
                    impropriety had occurred in connection with the sale to the possible detriment
                    of <em>in rem</em> creditors of the arrested vessel. In my
                    view, it made no difference to the legal enquiry that a direct sale of an
                    arrested vessel was made expressly subject to the court’s
                approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Tan’s submissions did not deal squarely
                    with the fundamental issue at hand. He did not address the legal basis of the
                    Bank’s Sanction Applications. The concern of this court was that the Bank
                    was essentially seeking the court’s approval or confirmation of the Direct
                    Private Sale (see [3] above) so as to attract the effect of a judicial sale in
                    respect of the Vessels. The main issue was under what principles, circumstances
                    and conditions should the court sanction the Direct Private Sale that was
                    entered between the Bank and the named buyer in order to suit its own purposes,
                    and turn it into an admiralty judicial sale (<em>ie</em>, a
                    judicial sale made <em>specifically</em> pursuant to the
                    court’s <em>admiralty</em> jurisdiction)? In doing
                    so, the court would be plainly departing from the normal order that the Sheriff
                    sells a vessel by appraisement, advertisement and inviting bids to purchase the
                    vessel: see Order 70 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the RSC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As this court saw it, simply because mortgagee
                    banks (as arresting parties) have in the past applied for and obtained orders
                    that sanctioned the private direct sales of arrested vessels would not be of
                    assistance as they were not conclusive of the matter. It would be misguided to
                    think that from those instances there now existed in Singapore an established
                    practice of the court, in exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, to sanction
                    private direct sales of arrested vessels as judicial sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Sanction Applications were dismissed on 26
                    April 2013. I gave brief oral grounds for refusing the Sanction Applications. I
                    had then indicated to Mr Tan that I would publish full written grounds in due
                    course. I am grateful to Mr Tan for subsequently drawing to my attention the
                    recent English decision of <em>Bank of Scotland plc v The Owners
                        of the MV “Union Gold”</em> [2013] EWHC 1696
                        (“<em>The Union Gold</em>”) where the
                    Bank of Scotland plc sought orders of sale of four vessels to named purchasers
                    at named prices. I will comment on <em>The Union Gold</em>
                    in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Distinction between a private sale and an admiralty judicial
                sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I begin with the distinction between a private
                    sale and a judicial sale of a vessel. A private sale of a vessel between the
                    vendor and purchaser transfers title in the vessel to the purchaser, subject to
                    the <em>in rem</em> liabilities existing at the time of the
                    sale and delivery of the vessel. Naturally, as a condition of the sale, the
                    vendor would have to warrant that the vessel was unencumbered and that there
                    were no existing debts or liabilities whatsoever. Typically, the vendor would
                    provide an indemnity that was counter secured by a guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In contrast with a private sale, an admiralty
                    judicial sale gives the purchaser a clean title to the vessel that is free from
                    all liens and encumbrances (<em>The Tremont</em> (1841) 1
                    Wm Rob 163; <em>The Acrux</em> [1962] 1 Lloyd's Rep 405 at
                    409 and more recently in <em>The Cerro Colorado</em> [1993]
                    1 Lloyd's Rep 58 at 60, 61 and Ryan J in <em>Readhead and Others
                        v Admiralty Marshal, Western Australia District Registry and
                        Others</em> (1998) 87 FCR 229 at 242F). In other words, the admiralty
                    judicial sale extinguished all <em>in rem</em> claims that
                    were attached to the vessel prior to the sale and the vessel was no longer
                    subject to arrest by virtue of those claims. The upshot of this should enable
                    the Sheriff to sell an arrested vessel at the market price of the vessel rather
                    than at a “forced sale” price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     This unique and important legal consequence of
                    an admiralty judicial sale is an ancient <em>in rem</em>
                    doctrine recognised in most admiralty jurisdictions. William Tetley QC in
                        <em>Maritime Liens and Claims</em> (1st Ed, Business
                    Law Communications Ltd, 1985) traced this doctrine at pp 468, 470-471:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Brown D.J. said in the <em>The
                            Trenton</em> [4 F. 657 at p. 663]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">No one could possibly know the value of his purchase, for no one could
                            foresee the amount of claims that might be made against the vessel in
                            other countries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The finality and integrity of the judicial sale and the validity of the
                        new title of ownership are therefore essential to the full realization of
                        the maritime lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All jurisdictions have recognized the importance of the principle that the
                        judicial sale of a ship be final and that the purchaser receive a clear
                        title, free of all charges whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An early explicit statement is found in the Ordonnance de la Marine of
                        1681 at Book I, Title XIV, art. 1:1</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… All ships and other vessels may be arrested and disposed of
                            under law; and all privileges and hypothecs will be purged by the decree
                            which will be made in the following form.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The leading English judicial statement is by Dr. Lushington
                        in <em>The Tremont</em> [(1841) 1 W. Rob. 163 at p.
                        164] who, in referring to the Admiralty Court, said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The jurisdiction of the Court in these matters is confirmed by the
                            municipal law of this country and by the general principles of the
                            maritime law; and the title conferred by the Court in the exercise of
                            this authority is a valid title against the whole world, and is
                            recognized by the Courts of this country and by the Courts of all other
                            countries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The same principle had been enunciated in earlier decisions, including
                            <em>The Flad Oyen</em> [(1799) 1 C. Rob. 134 at p.
                        138] and <em>The Helena</em> [(1801) 4 C. Rob. 3], and
                        has been followed in subsequent judgments such as <em>Castrique v. Imrie</em> [(1869-70) L.R. 4 H.L. 414] and <em>The Ruby</em> [[1898] P. 52]. The integrity and finality
                        of the foreign judicial sale has been upheld in France, in the U.S. and in
                        Canada.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An equally famous dictum is of Brown D.J. in <em>The Trenton</em> [4 F. 657 at p 659]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In short, the doctrine that the sale of a vessel by a court of
                            competent jurisdiction discharges her from liens of every description,
                            is the law of the civilized world.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr Lushington’s statements in <em>The Tremont</em> are fundamental to admiralty judicial sales.
                    Indeed, many legal systems continue to give effect to admiralty judicial sales
                    of foreign courts as a matter of comity. This recognition of the legal
                    consequences of an admiralty judicial sale is important to a purchaser who
                    intends to register the vessel in a different jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the present case, it was reasonable to
                    presume that as in any private sale, the Bank’s named buyers required the
                    warranty and indemnity mentioned in [10] above. It would also not be surprising
                    to find the Bank unwilling to be so bound. The best commercial solution would be
                    to seek the court’s approval of a private sale to obtain the advantages
                    that an admiralty judicial sale would confer <em>ie</em>,
                    clean title of the Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Principles and effect of an admiralty judicial sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As stated, an admiralty judicial sale gives to
                    the purchaser title to the vessel that is free from all liens and encumbrances.
                    The legal premise and effect of an admiralty judicial sale that confers on the
                    purchaser clean title of the vessel is that existing maritime claims of all
                        <em>in rem</em> claimants against the vessel are
                    transferred to the sale proceeds of the vessel (<em>The
                        Acrux</em> [1962] 1 Lloyd's Rep 405 at 409). Such <em>in rem</em> claimants include persons that may not have filed
                        <em>in rem</em> writs or caveats against release, but
                    have an interest in the vessel and sale. It is worth noting that the existing
                    maritime claims of <em>in rem</em> claimants against the
                    vessel are divested by the judicial sale in proceedings to which these claimants
                    are not a party to and in which they may well have no notice of. While these
                    maritime claimants are nonetheless allowed to participate in the sale proceeds,
                    this concomitant transfer of maritime claims (and priority) from the vessel to
                    the proceeds of sale in court is the <em>raison
                        d’etre</em> of the principle that a judicial sale is for the
                    protection and benefit of all persons interested in the <em>res</em>; it is not only for the interest of the arresting party
                    alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As William Waung J in <em>Den
                        Norske Bank ASA v Owners of the ship “Margo L”</em>
                    [1997] HKEC 767 (“<em>The Margo L</em>”)
                    opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The role of the Admiralty Court is to ensure that any sale of the vessel
                        is effected in such a way as to protect all Admiralty claimants not merely
                        the Plaintiff who arrested the ship or who requested ex parte the Admiralty
                        Court to sell the ship or who has obtained ex parte a very large judgment
                        (which can be set aside when contested by interested competing claimants) or
                        who has a high priority claim. The best way (which is also the normal way)
                        that the Admiralty Court ensures protection for all Admiralty claimants is
                        by insisting upon the sale of the ship being done by all the well tried out
                        method of appraisement and sale by public tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     To protect the interests of all persons with
                        <em>in rem</em> claims against the vessel including the
                    defendant shipowner, the court has to have entire control over the sale process
                    thereby safeguarding the propriety and integrity of the sale process and,
                    ultimately, instilling confidence and standing of the judicial sale from this
                    jurisdiction. To this end, there are comprehensive procedures in O 70 for a
                    court ordered judicial sale to be carried out by the Sheriff pursuant to a
                    commission for appraisement to ascertain the value of the vessel, by the
                    placement of advertisements and invitation to submit bids for the purchase of
                    the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Once the Sheriff is commissioned to appraise
                    and sell the vessel, he is under a duty to first appraise the vessel to
                    ascertain the value. The Sheriff would be assisted by professional and
                    experienced appraisers who as court-appointed appraisers have to act faithfully
                    and impartially. The amount of the appraised value is kept confidential so as
                    not to affect the price at which bids are received. Ordinarily, the Sheriff
                    would accept the highest bid price unless it is below the appraised value. When
                    the court is asked to exercise its discretion to approve a judicial sale where
                    the highest bid price is below the appraised value, the Sheriff hands over the
                    confidential appraisement report of the court-appointed appraiser in a sealed
                    envelope for the court’s consideration. At no point in time would the
                    amount of the appraisal be revealed to the public. In doing so, the integrity of
                    the judicial sale process is preserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The duty of the Sheriff is to realise the
                    highest price from the sale for the benefit of all interested parties (<em>The Silia</em> [1981] Lloyd’s Rep 534 at 535; <em>The Margo L</em>). In <em>The Honshu
                        Gloria</em> [1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep 63, Sheen J found that the Admiralty
                    Marshal was entitled to obtain the services of a classification society prior to
                    the commission of sale in order to retain the vessel in class to achieve the
                    highest price for the vessel. Similarly, in <em>The Westport (No
                        2)</em> [1965] 1 Lloyd's Rep 549, the Admiralty Marshal was permitted
                    to arrange for repairs to the feed-water pump of the vessel in order to ensure
                    that the vessel could be sold as a going concern at a higher
                price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The placing of advertisements not only
                    publicise the sale to a wider audience interested in bidding for the vessel to
                    obtain the best possible bid price, but they also serve to notify the sale to
                    all others interested in the vessel so that they can come forward and establish
                    their maritime claims. These interested parties include other claimants that may
                    not have issued <em>in rem</em> writs or filed caveats
                    against release but have an interest in the vessel and sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally for the sake of completeness, in
                    relation to the rights of <em>in rem</em> claimants against
                    the vessel that have been transferred to the sale proceeds by virtue of the
                    judicial sale, there is a comprehensive procedure in the RSC for the priority of
                    these claims to be determined and for the distribution of the sale proceeds
                    among all who come forward and establish their maritime claims within a
                    specified time (see O 70 r 21(2)). The proceeding is entirely <em>in rem</em>, and it binds the world.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Court’s discretionary power to order a judicial sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The power of the court to sell a vessel under
                    arrest after judgment <em>in rem</em> is obtained against
                    that vessel is well established. I have referred to the court’s discretion
                    with respect to the confirmation of judicial sales, in particular, where the
                    highest bid price received by the Sheriff was below the appraised value (see
                    [18] above). In one sense, such an application to sell below the appraised value
                    is illustrative of the function of a judicial sale in which two competing
                    concerns in a judicial sale are balanced: that of accepting the highest bid
                    price at a fairly conducted Sheriff’s sale on the one hand, and weighing
                    that concern against the purpose to be achieved by a judicial sale, which is to
                    benefit all persons interested in the <em>res</em> on the
                    other (see [15]-[17] above) . There is no doubt that the court has discretion to
                    refuse to confirm a judicial sale <em>below</em> the
                    appraised value where the disparity between the highest bid price and the
                    valuation of the court-appointed appraiser is so great as to possibly result in
                    a sale that is relatively cheap and, on its face, prejudicial to the other
                        <em>in rem</em> creditors and the defendant shipowner.
                    The unfettered discretion to refuse the bid price could be exercised even in the
                    absence of evidence suggesting that the sale was conducted unfairly or that a
                    higher realisable sale price was possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Notably, a party seeking to obtain the
                    court’s sanction of a private direct sale is essentially departing from
                    the comprehensive procedure in the RSC. Therefore, any substitute method of sale
                    (and its propriety) would have to be weighed against the purpose to be achieved
                    by a judicial sale order granted in the normal way. More often than not, the
                    substitute method of sale, for example, a court sanctioned private sale (as was
                    the case here), is advanced for the applicant’s own purpose and benefit
                    and is <em>prima facie</em> unfair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>International Marine
                        Banking Co v Dora [No. 2]</em> [1977] 1 FC 603 at [7]
                        (“<em>The Dora</em>”), the plaintiff
                    applied for the private sale of the vessel and submitted that the sale price of
                    CAD 5.9 million was the best price obtainable. The Canadian court refused to
                    allow the sale after examining sale process. In doing so, it held at
                    [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly I am not prepared to approve the procedures followed either as
                        being a satisfactory substitute for what might have been prescribed by the
                        Court had an application been made, or as calculated to achieve the best
                        price obtainable. The fact of the matter, as I view it, is that the
                        procedure is one prescribed by the plaintiff as satisfactory for its own
                        purposes and the proposed sale which has resulted from it is not a sale by
                        the Court at all but a sale by the plaintiff for which it now seeks the
                        endorsement of the Court to give the transaction the appearance of a sale by
                        the Court. I would not, therefore, be prepared to grant the order sought
                        even if I were satisfied that the 5.9 million price is as high as any price
                        likely to be obtained on a sale by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Similarly, in <em>The Margo
                        L</em>, the plaintiff bank applied to sell the vessel to a buyer found
                    by the plaintiff, and at a specified price. Waung J noted that a private sale at
                    a pre-determined price to a named purchaser was not generally the accepted way
                    to sell the vessel for the best possible price. In that case, he considered the
                    valuation certificates produced by the plaintiff bank to show that a proper
                    appraisement of the vessel in question had been done and held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case, Den Norsk Bank which is a ship finance specialist is asking
                        the Court (as it has done repeatedly on a number of occasions) to depart
                        from the normal mode of sale and to allow its proposed purchaser Hudson to
                        buy the Vessel at US$3.4 million. In support of this application, the Bank
                        relies on three brief Valuation Certificates from three valuers who valued
                        the Vessel at respectively US$2.5 million, US$2.75 million and US$3.2
                        million. Unfortunately as often happens in this sort of maritime valuation
                        of ships, no detailed analysis was shown in these Valuation Certificates as
                        to the factors and reasons which led to these valuations being given and in
                        the absence of analysis and reasons, there can be no proper weighing of the
                        strength of any of these Valuation Certificates or why one should be
                        preferred over the other or why any one should be accepted. This most
                        unsatisfactory nature of the valuations of the Vessel is however only one
                        aspect of why the Court cannot allow private sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As I see it, these two decisions resonate with
                    our admiralty jurisprudence and reflect the court’s concern with a
                    substitute method of sale (see [23] above). In this case, the Bank, as mortgagee
                    in possession, wanted the court’s sanction of the Direct Private Sale to
                    obtain the perceived advantages of both judicial and private sales for its own
                    benefit. The divergence in the interest of the Sheriff acting pursuant to a
                    commission for appraisement and sale and such a party must necessarily require
                    the court to exercise caution when dealing with this sort of hybrid sale
                    application and to carefully scrutinise each application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Recently, Teare J in <em>The
                        Union Gold</em> held that as a matter of general principle the court
                    should not order a sale to a buyer found by the arresting party notwithstanding
                    that the proposed price appeared to be at or about the market value of the
                    vessel. In <em>The Union Gold</em>, the applicant mortgagee
                    bank arrested four small cargo vessels on 24 May 2013, and thereafter applied
                    for an order that they be sold <em>pendente lite</em> to
                    named buyers at named prices. The defendant shipowner owed the mortgagee bank
                    EUR 4.5 million on a loan that was secured by mortgages over three of those four
                    vessels (the three vessels were <em>Union Emerald</em>,
                        <em>Union Silver</em> and <em>Union
                        Gold</em>). In addition, the aggregate debt of EUR 13.5 million was
                    separately secured by a mortgage on the fourth vessel (<em>Union
                        Pluto</em>). Besides the bank, there were other creditors with
                        <em>in rem</em> claims against the vessels. The bank
                    had received an offer to purchase all four vessels at various prices which
                    either exceeded the highest valuations obtained by the bank or were within the
                    range of the valuation. For example, the bank received an offer of EUR 329,000
                    which was in excess of the bank’s valuation of <em>Union
                        Pluto</em>. I will come to the facts of the fourth vessel, <em>Union Pluto</em>, in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Teare J had a number of concerns with the
                    mortgagee bank’s application for a direct sale. First, the private direct
                    sale was without the usual appraisement conducted by the Admiralty Marshal.
                    Second, seeking the court’s approval of a sale to a named buyer at a named
                    price had the effect of asking the court to appraise the value of the vessels
                    and in the course of this revealed the valuations obtained by the bank to
                    potential buyers. This contrasted with the usual case where the vessel is
                    appraised by the Admiralty Marshal and the appraised value is kept confidential.
                    Third, the direct sale to the named buyer would do away with the need to
                    advertise the sale and invite offers to buy the vessels. In fact, the court was
                    simply asked to approve a sale to a buyer found by the bank, and there was a
                    risk that the vessels would not be sold at the best possible price. All those
                    concerns strongly suggested to Teare J that it would be wrong in principle to
                    depart from the usual order that the Admiralty Marshal sell the vessels by
                    appraisement, advertisement and inviting bids for the vessels. As it was
                    important that the reputation of the Admiralty Court for impartiality for
                    judicial sale of vessels not be tarnished in any way, Teare J’s concern
                    was that acceding to the bank’s application might give the impression that
                    the Admiralty Marshal was acting for a particular <em>in
                        rem</em> claimant and the defendant shipowner. With all these
                    concerns, Teare J refused the bank’s application that the first three
                    vessels be sold to named buyers at named prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I am in agreement with Waung J in <em>The Margo L</em> and Teare J in <em>The Union
                        Gold</em> that where a court is asked to depart from the normal course
                    of commissioning the Sheriff to appraise and sell the vessel, the applicant has
                    to identify the existence of “<em>powerful special
                        features</em>” or “<em>special
                        circumstance</em>s” before the court will be prepared to make
                    the order that is sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Bank of Scotland v
                        “Nel” (The)</em> (1997) 140 FTR 271, a vessel was loaded
                    with 34,398 tonnes of sulphur that was to be carried from British Columbia to
                    Tunisia when it was arrested. The mortgagee was concerned that the sulphur would
                    cause severe corrosion damage to the vessel and the possibility of off-loading
                    the sulphur was considered but found to be very expensive. The mortgagee found a
                    purchaser who would carry the cargo to its destination and was willing to pay
                    20% above the valuations prepared by shipbrokers. Although the Canadian court
                    noted that the mortgagee was acting purely out of self-interest, in allowing the
                    private sale, it acknowledged (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present instance, the sale may well suit the Plaintiff's purposes,
                        but there are also broader common purposes including the ability to obtain
                        proper value for a vessel that is at present apparently seaworthy but if
                        left for a number of weeks, to accomplish a court ordered sale, might
                        develop corrosion damage, become suspect as to condition and seaworthiness
                        and thus be difficult to sell at a good price. Moreover, any buyer would
                        likely insist that the cargo be off-loaded, a large expense coming out of
                        the sale price, for no knowledgable (sic) buyer would be interested in a
                        ship loaded with a cargo of sulphur say three or four months old or with
                        trying to deliver that cargo by a voyage through a tropical or subtropical
                        climate, with the prospect of adding to the corrosion damage which would
                        almost certainly have begun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>The Union
                        Gold</em>, Teare J agreed to the bank’s application to sell the
                    fourth vessel, <em>Union Pluto</em>, to a buyer found by
                    the bank and at a named price as there were “<em>special
                        circumstances</em>” pertaining to the fourth vessel that
                    warranted such an order. There was evidence that a prompt sale was crucial to
                    preserving a long-term contract which provided business for this vessel. If the
                    long-term contract was lost (and there was evidence that it was at risk of being
                    lost), then jobs of 21 persons including crew and shore-based personnel would be
                    lost. The fourth vessel was also an old ship that was unlikely to attract
                    buyers. Besides, the named buyer was in a position to retain and operate the
                    long-term contract, and if that contract was lost, the named buyer was not
                    likely to buy the fourth vessel. All these matters persuaded Teare J that,
                    exceptionally, there was a need for a prompt sale and hence it was appropriate
                    to grant the order sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     These two cases illustrate what might
                    constitute “<em>powerful special
                    features</em>” or “<em>special
                        circumstances</em>”. In the final analysis, much will depend on
                    the facts of each case. Cogent evidence of exceptional circumstances must be
                    adduced by a party seeking judicial confirmation of a private direct
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The concerns expressed by Teare J in <em>The Union Gold</em> (see [28] above) featured equally in the
                    present case. As such, I too share the same concerns as Teare J and I adopt them
                    for their relevance and applicability with the same force and effect to the
                    facts of the Sanction Applications. On the evidence, it was clear that the
                    Direct Private Sale was a private arrangement that the Bank had entered with a
                    named purchaser for a named price to suit its own purposes. In fact, the
                    intention to sell the Vessels to the named buyer at a named price was present
                    before proceedings <em>in rem</em> were commenced (see [2]
                    above). Such a sale cannot be lightly sanctioned as a matter of admiralty
                    jurisprudence. At the risk of repetition, the purpose to be achieved by an
                    admiralty judicial sale is to protect the rights of and benefit all interested
                    persons, not just the rights and interests of the arresting party and the
                    defendant shipowner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The affidavit evidence filed in support of the
                    Sale Applications did not show, and hence, did not support a departure from the
                    normal sale order for the Sheriff to sell the Vessels by appraisement,
                    advertisement and invitation to submit bids to purchase the
                vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Notably, the Bank’s affidavit sworn by
                    one of its officers disclosed a short one page memorandum summarizing the
                    processes taken by its appointed shipbroker as evidence of the steps that it
                    took to bring each of the Vessels to the market and the process by which the
                    eventual proposed purchaser was selected. The memorandum states that the Bank
                    has been “<em>aggressively marketing the Vessels on a
                        global basis to ensure all potential buyers were aware that the Vessels were
                        for sale</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Given that the Bank is trying to
                    persuade the court to depart from the normal course of commissioning the Sheriff
                    to appraise and sell the Vessels, leaving aside the lack of any
                        “<em>powerful special features</em>” or
                        “<em>special circumstances</em>” for the
                    moment, one would have expected the Bank to provide more detailed evidence of
                    the steps it had taken to bring the sale of the arrested vessel to the attention
                    of the market at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, based on the two valuations
                    provided by the Bank, the price offered by each of the named purchaser was not
                    significantly higher than the appraised values. It was not enough to simply
                    state that the highest amounts that other potential buyers on the market were
                    willing to pay for the Vessels were below the appraised values. There was also
                    scant information about the other serious bidder who the Bank’s
                    shipbrokers said it considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Finally, the Bank pointed to the estimated
                    weekly expenses of maintaining the Vessels. In fact, this seemed to be the main
                    justification put forward for the private sale. While they were not
                    insignificant, having regard to the potential value of the Vessels, I was of the
                    opinion that these expenses do not constitute “<em>powerful special features</em>” or “<em>special circumstances</em>” that justify the court departing
                    from the usual course of ordering the appraisement and sale of the
                    Vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, just because no other
                    claimants with <em>in rem</em> claims against the Vessels
                    have stepped forward was not a reason for this court to approve the Direct
                    Private Sale as an admiralty judicial sale. As mentioned, the priority of
                    competing <em>in rem</em> claims to the proceeds from the
                    sale of an arrested vessel is a matter for consideration after the vessel has
                    been sold and the sale proceeds paid into court. Accordingly, I refused the
                    Bank’s applications to sanction the Direct Private Sale of the Vessels as
                    an admiralty judicial sale. Instead, I granted the alternative prayer for the
                    Vessels to be appraised and sold by the Sheriff.</p>
