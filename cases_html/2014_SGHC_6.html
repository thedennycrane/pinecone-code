<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an appeal by the Plaintiff from the decision of the learned Assistant
Registrar Teo Guan Kee (“the AR”) in Summons No 3506 of 2013 (“Sum
3506”) delivered on 28 August 2013, granting the Defendant conditional
leave to defend Suit No 352 of 2013 (“the Second Suit”) under O
14 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 233, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) (“ROC”).
The subject matter of the Second Suit relates back to an earlier
action between the same parties which was supposed to have been
“resolved” by means of a Settlement Agreement dated 1 February 2013
(“the Settlement Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
appeal involves an interesting legal issue which is whether, and
if so to what degree, the alleged illegality in an action would
taint a settlement agreement arising out of that action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After
hearing the parties, I am allowing the appeal and reversing the decision
of the AR granting conditional leave to defend. Summary judgment
is, therefore, entered in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
Plaintiff and Defendant were business associates in a public company
in Singapore, Firstlink Investments Corporation Limited (“Firstlink”).
The Plaintiff, Ling Yew Kong, is the Executive Chairman of Firstlink
(“the Plaintiff”), and the Defendant, Teo Vin Li Richard (the “Defendant”),
got to know the Plaintiff through various business dealings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Plaintiff is the appellant in the appeal before me while the Defendant
is the respondent. I refer to parties in their original capacity
as in the hearing below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit No 733 of 2012 – the First
Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Suit
No 733 of 2012 was started in the High Court of Singapore on 4 September
2012 (“the First Suit”). The First Suit embodied a claim by the plaintiff
against the defendant for $730,000 alleged to be owed by the Defendant
together with interests and costs. According to the Plaintiff’s Statement
of Claim in the First Suit dated 4 September 2012, the money was loaned
to the Defendant to enable the Defendant to pay a debt that he owed to
one Foo Chek Hin (“Foo”). Payment was made by the Plaintiff by means of
a cheque dated 6 January 2012 drawn to the order of Foo. The Plaintiff’s claim
was that Defendant had agreed to repay the monies, but eventually failed
to do so. In support of the claim, the Plaintiff pleaded a signed Acknowledgement
dated 5 January 2012 (hereinafter referred to as “the Acknowledgment
of Debt”). The Plaintiff in further support also asserted that the
Defendant had attempted to make a part payment of the debt on or around
17 February 2012 by means of a cheque of $100,000 drawn to the order
of the Plaintiff, and was therefore a further acknowledgment of
the debt. The cheque was subsequently dishonoured when presented
for payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
defence filed in the First Suit dated 2 October 2012 denied the claim.
The defence was that the Plaintiff and Defendant had discussed a number
of commercial projects in early 2011 and through the discussions the
Defendant came to trust and have confidence in the Plaintiff, treating the
Plaintiff as a “mentor and a good friend”. The Defendant asserted
that the Plaintiff frequently entertained businessmen at the integrated
resorts in Singapore, and that sometime in April 2011 the Plaintiff
and Defendant agreed that the Plaintiff would “act as a junket”
by offering credit in the form of non-negotiable chips to businessmen
and friends of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The Defendant asserted
that by doing this the Plaintiff would earn a “rolling commission”
from the casino. In accordance with this alleged agreement, the
Plaintiff was said to have opened a credit account with Marina Bay
Sands casino (“MBS”) whereby the Plaintiff enjoyed a credit line
up to $500,000. In this way, the Plaintiff was alleged to have withdrawn
chips which were passed to businessmen and friends of the Plaintiff
and Defendant. This was said to result in the Plaintiff securing
a commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       By
doing this, the Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff was acting
as a junket in contravention of s 110(1) of the Casino Control Act
(Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CCA”). In addition, the Defendant pleaded
that the Plaintiff was acting as a moneylender by providing chips
on credit contrary to s 108(9) of the CCA. According to the Defendant,
by December 2011, the Plaintiff was indebted to MBS as a result
of gambling losses, and it was the Defendant who then “suggested”
that the Plaintiff borrow money from Foo, a mutual friend, so as
to discharge his indebtedness to MBS. Subsequently, the Plaintiff
repaid Foo by means of the cheque payment of $730,000 that was referred
to in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. As for the alleged attempted
part payment, the Defendant’s explanation was that the cheque of
$100,000 was presented to the Plaintiff to cover the gambling losses which
had been incurred by “one of the Defendant’s friends”. The cheque was
supposed to be by way of security pending payment by the friend
(and not to be presented without informing the Defendant). Therefore, according
to the Defendant, he did not owe the sum of $730,000 as this was really
the sum paid off to Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       To
cap off the defence, the Defendant also asserted that in any case,
if it was found otherwise, the alleged debt was unenforceable on
account of contravention of the CCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Whatever
the parties’ position in the First Suit, this eventually culminated
in a Settlement Agreement between the parties settling the First Suit.
As the Settlement Agreement was the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim
in the Second Suit, parties in the Second Suit had attempted to
explain their rationale for entering into this Settlement Agreement,
which I now briefly state for background purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Given
the claim and defence filed in the First Suit, the adequacy and/or
interpretation of the Acknowledgement of Debt was of some importance.
In Summons No 5598 of 2012 (“Sum 5598”), the Defendant had applied
to expunge certain portions of the Plaintiff’s affidavit dated 16 October
2012 (pursuant to another Summons No 5334 of 2012), which contained
an admission note dated 3 October 2012. Sum 5598 came before the
learned Assistant Registrar Boey Yi Ling Germaine (“AR Boey”), who dismissed
the application. On appeal (Registrar’s Appeal No 501 of 2012), Lai
Siu Chiu J reversed AR Boey’s decision, thereby expunging the admission
note of 3 October 2012 that the Plaintiff had hoped to rely on. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff asserts that
this was the context that explains why he was amenable to a settlement
– by way of a compromise as to their different positions in the
First Suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
Defendant asserts that he was amenable to a settlement even though
he “appreciated the strength” of his position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The First Suit was settled as
“litigation was proving to be too prolonged, contentious and costly”
and also because the litigious proceedings “had a negative impact
on my business relationships” and would “impose further strain on
me and worsen deteriorating business relations between myself and
the aforesaid third party friends.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
Settlement Agreement was signed on 1 February 2013 as subsequently
supplemented by an exchange of letters dated 5 February 2013 between
the Plaintiff and Defendant’s solicitors. I elaborate further on
the Settlement Agreement below at [19] to [24], but suffice to state
for now the main terms of the Settlement Agreement were that the
claim for $730,000 in the First Suit was to be settled as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Payment
of $100,000 in cash to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)
no later than 28 February 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Payment
of $230,000 in cash to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)
no later than 31 March 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Delivery
by the Defendant to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)
of share transfer forms in respect of 11,500,000 ordinary shares
in the capital of Firstlink (with the relevant share certificates)
no later than 15 February 2013. In the event that this was not done,
the Defendant would be immediately liable to pay the sum of $400,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     Provision
that if the Defendant failed to meet the above obligations by the
dates as provided that the Defendant would forthwith become liable
for all amounts not so paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In
accordance with the Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff filed a notice
of discontinuance in the First Suit on 5 February 2013. Subsequently, the
Defendant caused the share transfer forms together with the relevant share
certificates to be delivered to the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The
Defendant, however, failed to make the other payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As
a result of the Defendant’s failure to fully satisfy the terms of
the Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff commenced the Second Suit
where he claimed against the Defendant the balance owing under the
Settlement Agreement (<em>ie</em>, $330,000
which is $730,000 less the value of the Firstlink shares).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Defence filed in the Second Suit is essentially run on two main fronts.
Put briefly, the first defence is that the Settlement Agreement
is tainted by the very same “illegality” which affected the Plaintiff’s
claim in the First Suit (I refer to this as “the illegality defence”).
The second is that there was an “understanding” that the Defendant
would seek to recover the sum of $330,000 from certain third party
friends who had incurred gaming losses and to thereafter hand the
monies over to the Plaintiff. In short, the second defence is that
the Defendant was never personally liable as such for the $330,000
and that what was required was that he should try to recover the
monies from third party friends despite the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In
the Reply filed in the Second Suit, the Plaintiff (save for any admissions
in the Reply) joined issues with the Defendant on the Defence. Insofar
as the allegations that the Plaintiff was acting as a junket operator
at MBS and that the debts were incurred in that context, the Plaintiff
pleaded that the allegations were largely “verbatim repeats” of
what had been pleaded by the Defendant in the First Suit and that
the Defendant should be fully aware of the Plaintiff’s position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
Plaintiff in the Second Suit also asserts that the defence filed
in the First Suit (<em>ie</em>, that he was
running a junket operation and was moneylending) was irrelevant
to the claim in the Second Suit and that in any case, all issues
arising from the First Suit had been “fully and finally settled”
as between the Plaintiff and the Defendant by virtue of the Settlement
Agreement. For good measure, the Plaintiff also pleads that the
Defendant never applied to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim in the
First Suit and that it was the Defendant who approached the Plaintiff
for settlement discussions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Insofar
as the pleadings filed in the Second Suit are concerned, it is noted
that the Plaintiff does not make any express reference to the assertion that
the Settlement Agreement arose out of earlier litigation said to
concern gaming debts and an illicit junket operation. Whilst the
Plaintiff did generally join issues with the defence, the main position
taken on the assertion of gaming debts and junket operation is that
even if the Plaintiff had acted as a junket operator, there was
no allegation or suggestion that the Plaintiff had extended any
credit to the Defendant in the form of non-negotiable chips or that
the Defendant was a customer of the Plaintiff in the junket business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Referring
back to the Acknowledgement of Debt which formed the basis of the
First Suit, the Plaintiff in the written submissions states that
the Defendant never explained how the debt owed to Foo and paid
by the Plaintiff on behalf of the Defendant was unenforceable by
virtue of the alleged junket operations. Instead, the Plaintiff
notes that the defence position in the First Suit on the debt owed
to Foo was that the sum of $730,000 was actually an amount borrowed
by the Plaintiff from Foo and that the cheque made out to Foo by
the Plaintiff was in fact repayment of the Plaintiff’s debt to Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The striking out application
and the Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
Plaintiff later took out Sum 3506 on 10 July 2013, which was an application
for summary judgment in the Second Action. Central to this application
was the parties’ position on the Settlement Agreement, which I elaborate
on now.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Settlement Agreement is dated 1 February 2013 and was signed by
the Plaintiff and the Defendant. It refers to the First Suit, sets
out the various terms of the settlement (see [13] above) and concludes
with the provision that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to and based on the above, the
parties agree that the Suit is fully and finally settled as between
them. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance
with, the laws of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On
5 February 2013, an exchange of letters took place between the solicitors
for the Plaintiff and Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The essence of these letters
is that the Defendant’s solicitor confirmed that the Defendant had
entered into the Settlement Agreement in accordance with the terms
summarised earlier subject to the Plaintiff filing a discontinuance
of the First Suit. The confirmation letter from the Defendant’s
solicitor makes no reference at all to any terms or conditions other
than those that have been referred to. Specifically, there is no
mention of any understanding or arrangement to the effect that the
Defendant’s liability for the cash payments under the settlement
was linked in any way to the recovery by the Defendant of the same
from the third party friends. There is no dispute that the notice
of discontinuance was indeed filed on time by the Plaintiff. Indeed,
it is also clear that on or around 28 February 2013, the Defendant
delivered the share transfer forms and share certificates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     By
doing so, the Plaintiff’s case is that Defendant (albeit late) had “partly
performed” the Settlement Agreement and demonstrated that “he considered
himself bound by the agreement.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> When the delivery of the share
transfer forms and certificates was made, there was no indication made
of any modification or qualification to the written terms of the Settlement
Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Defendant’s explanation of the return of the shares is rather different.
According to the Defendant, the Defendant purchased 11,500,000 ordinary
shares in the Plaintiff’s company sometime in 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This
was alleged to have been done with the encouragement of the Plaintiff.
The Defendant asserts that he wanted to return these shares and
felt that this could be done by means of settlement of the First
Suit. To this end, the Defendant states that they agreed that the
shares would be assigned a value of $400,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.
The Defendant adds that the transfer of the shares was “fundamental”
to the settlement and that he agreed to transfer the shares by way
of settlement of his “limited liability” in respect of the gaming
losses of $730,000 said to have been incurred by the “Plaintiff
and our friends” at MBS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> By “limited liability”
it appears that the Defendant is referring (at least in part) to
his “liability” to recover the monies borrowed/losses incurred by
the Defendant’s friends under the alleged illegal junket scheme.
 The Defendant asserts that he never admitted personal liability
for the sum of $330,000 and that he had reached an understanding
with the Plaintiff that the Defendant would recover the sum of $330,000
“from our mutual friends”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In
any case, as mentioned above, the Defendant’s position is also that the
Settlement Agreement was tainted by illegality and therefore should
not be enforced by the courts. I will elaborate on this illegality
defence at [38] to [46] below where I discuss my findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision of the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Sum
3506 came before the AR who, on 28 August 2013, granted the Defendant
leave to defend upon the condition that Defendant provided security
of $330,000 in the form of a banker’s guarantee by 18 September 2013.
In his brief grounds of decision, the reason was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… although the Defendant appears to have
raised a triable issue … in the form of the illegality argument,
namely that the debt arose out of circumstances in which the Plaintiff
would be deemed an unlicensed moneylender pursuant to section 108
of the Casino Control Act read with section 14 of the Moneylenders
Act, this defence is shadowy in nature and does not justify the
granting of unconditional leave to defend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The
AR also stated that he decided to grant conditional leave because the
evidence adduced by the Plaintiff (essentially the acknowledgment
note from Foo and the cheque image):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…falls just short of what in my view is
required to rebut the Defendant’s assertions that the transaction
underlying the settlement agreement was unlicensed moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Significantly,
the AR also found that the Defendant’s assertion that there was
an oral agreement (to the effect that the Defendant was only required
to pay $330,000 under the Settlement Agreement if and when the Defendant
managed to recover the same from the third party friends) was unsubstantiated.
 The AR’s view was that that there was simply no evidence to support
the existence of such an agreement which would allow him to place
any weight on the assertion for the purposes of the application
before him. The Defendant had merely made a bare assertion as to
the oral agreement and had never mentioned such an oral agreement
in any of the earlier communications with the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Given
the findings of the AR, the only issue before this court is whether
the AR had erred in law in granting the defendant conditional leave
to defend having in mind that the illegality defence was “shadowy
in nature”.  The legal issue before this court is, therefore, whether
having settled the First Suit, the Defendant can or should be allowed
to raise the illegality defence again as a means of undermining
the Settlement Agreement, <em>viz</em>, in
arguing that the Settlement Agreement is tainted by the alleged
illegality in the First Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Applicable Legal Principles:
Summary Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before
examining the illegality defence, I first discuss the applicable legal
principles pertaining to an application for summary judgment. Order 14
r 1 of the ROC provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1</b>.    
              <b>Application by plaintiff for summary
judgment (O. 14, r. 1)</b>

on a defendant and that defendant has served a defence to the statement
of claim, the plaintiff may on the ground that that defendant has
no defence to a claim included in the writ … apply to the Court
for judgment against that defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The
principles governing the grant of summary judgement are well known
and will be referred to in brief. As the author in <em>Singapore
Civil Procedure 2013</em> (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
Maxwell, 2013) (“<em>Selvam on Singapore Civil
Procedure</em>”) explains, the purpose of a summary judgment
is to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there
is plainly no defence to the claim. At para 14/1/2, he further states
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]f the defendant’s only suggested defence
is a point of law and the court can see at once that the point is
misconceived (or if arguable can be shown shortly to be plainly
unsustainable) the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On
the other hand, the author continues to state that summary judgment
is not appropriate if the case lends itself to determining points
of law or construction that may take hours or even days and the
citation of many authorities before the court is in a position to
arrive at a final decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Order
14 r 3 of the ROC goes on to provide that unless the court dismisses
the application or the defendant satisfies the court that there
is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried or that
there ought for some other reason to be a trial of the claim (in
whole or part), the court may give judgment for the plaintiff. Where
the court determines that leave to defend is appropriate, O 14 r
4 provides that the leave may either be unconditional or on terms
such as the provision of security. In deciding whether it is appropriate
to grant summary judgment, it has been said that even an assertion
of fraud is not necessarily sufficient to avoid summary judgment
if the court believes that there is no prospect of success at trial (see <em>Ganesan Carlose &amp; Partners v American Home Assurance
Co</em> [1994] 2 SLR 332). On the other hand, this court is
reminded that a defendant is not to be shut out from defending unless
it is very clear that there is no defence. Indeed <em>Selvam
on Singapore Civil Procedure</em> at para 14/4/5 states that “where
the defence can be described as more than shadowy but less than probable,
leave to defend should be given.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In
deciding whether leave to defend should be granted, the court is also
reminded that leave to defend is to be granted not simply in cases where
there appears to be a fair case for defence but also where there
is “some other reason” for a trial. Whilst the latter words are
of wide scope, ordinarily, it is suggested, there should be some
connection between the “other reason” and the substantive merits
of the Plaintiff’s claim. Tricky questions can arise where the reason
(or even the main reason) why the Defendant wants a trial is because
of publicity. That said, <em>Selvam on Singapore
Civil Procedure</em> at para 14/4/6 gives the example of a
decision where the plaintiff’s case tended to show that he had acted
harshly or unconscionably and it is thought desirable that if he
were to get judgment at all it should be in the full light of publicity
(citing <em>Bank fur Gemeinwirtshaft AG v City
of London Garages Ltd</em> [1971] 1 All ER 541 at 548). Yet
another example cited was the decision of Chan Sek Keong J (as he
then was) in <em>Concentrate Engineering Pte Ltd
v United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd</em> [1990] SLR 514.
The latter was a case where the evidence showed a bold and unusual
scheme to defraud by use of apparently forged cheques. In these
circumstances, the defendant bank suspected that someone inside
the plaintiff was involved. The decision of Chan Sek Keong J was
that the sheer audacity of the sophisticated fraud and the absence
of explanation by the plaintiff’s directors was “some other reason”
for a trial. That said, it does not follow that leave to defend
is always appropriate simply because there are background criminal
investigations or that the defendant needs more time.   Each case
for summary judgment must, of course, turn on its own facts. Where
it is clear that there is no defence, the fact that the court disapproves
of the general behaviour of the Plaintiff or parties is not a reason
to deny summary judgment. The position will be different if the unconscionable
conduct of the Plaintiff opens the door to a possible defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In
a similar vein, Jeffrey Pinsler SC in <em>Principles
of Civil Procedure</em>, (Academy Publishing, 2013) (“<em>Pinsler on Principles of Civil Procedure</em>”)
at 266 states that since summary judgment is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a final judgment, which disregards fact
finding procedures leading to a thorough adjudication at trial,
the court would want to be satisfied that there is no other reason
why the case should go through the normal case of litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
caveat stated in <em>Pinsler on Principles of Civil
Procedure</em> at 267 also bears underscoring:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] defendant must show clear justification
for his reliance on this ground. A vague allegation that a case
needs to be investigated in the absence of good reason would not
constitute some other reason for trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Where
leave to defend is appropriate, an issue may arise as to whether the
leave should be unconditional or subject to terms. <em>Selvam
on Singapore Civil Procedure</em> at para 14/4/12 explains
that granting leave to defend subject to terms such as provision
of security is appropriate in those cases where there is good ground
for believing that the defence is a sham defence and where the court
is very nearly prepared to give judgment. In this respect, it has
often been said that conditional leave is appropriate where the
defence is “shadowy” or “suspicious”. Whilst these adjectives may
be of some (limited) assistance, it is necessary to bear in mind
the principle that lies behind the exercise of the discretion. To
this end, the comments of Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <em>Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons
Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 bear repeating. In that case the
court stated that the multitude of terms used such as “a real doubt
about the defendant’s good faith”, “shadowy”, “sham”, “suspicious”,
“hardly of substance” were somewhat “pejorative” and which may obscure
the true principle. In his view, imposition of a condition on the
leave to defend was appropriate in those cases where the court is
of the view that whilst it cannot be said that the claimed defence
is so hopeless that in truth there is no defence, that “the overall
impression is such that some demonstration of commitment on the
part of the defendant to the claimed defence is called for.” It
follows that unconditional leave to defend should be granted where there
is a reasonable ground (fair probability) for a defence. On the
other hand, where the court is satisfied that there is no defence,
it would not be appropriate to permit the defendant to “purchase”
leave to defend by means of payment of security for the claim. Conditional
leave may be most appropriate in those cases where the apparent
strength of the claimed defence lies somewhere between (reasonable
ground and no defence) coupled with some doubt as to the sincerity
of the defendant’s position or intention to defend. Clearly, however,
the interplay between these two points will depend on the circumstances
of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     With
these principles in mind, I now turn to discuss whether the AR had
erred in granting the Defendant conditional leave to defend (hence dismissing
the application for summary judgment) in the light of the illegality
defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the Defendant be allowed
to raise the very same set of issues again as a means of undermining
the Settlement Agreement, <em>viz</em> in
arguing that the Settlement Agreement is tainted by the alleged
illegality in the First Suit?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The illegality/money-lending
argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
illegality defence asserted is predicated on the submissions that the
subject sum of the Second Suit, $330,000, was derived from illegal gambling
activities which the Plaintiff was involved in. In the Defendant’s written
submissions, it is said that the sum was the total of the illegal gambling
debts incurred and owed to the Plaintiff by certain third party friends.
The Settlement Agreement reached in the First Suit and which was the
basis of the claim in the Second Suit is said to have been entered
into on the premise that the Plaintiff and Defendant preserve their
business relations and friendship and that in this regard the Defendant
would not expose further details of the Plaintiff’s illegal junket
operations. Even though the Plaintiff (in the Second Suit) is suing
on the basis of the Settlement Agreement, the Defendant asserts
that the gaming matters of the First Suit are not irrelevant since
any settlement agreement founded on an illegal gambling debt was
defective and that, once tainted, any residual claim based on the
Settlement Agreement must be unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section
108(9)(<em>a</em>) of the CCA provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>108</b>.—(9)
Any person who —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    provides chips on credit
to persons other than as permitted in subsection (7) or (7A) shall
be deemed to be a moneylender for the purposes of the Moneylenders
Act (Cap.188); …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Subsections
(7) and (7A) are concerned with the provision of chips on credit
by a casino operator and a licensed international market agent and are
not relevant to the proceedings at hand. In addition the Defendant
relies on s 110(1) of the CCA which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Prohibited
casino marketing arrangements</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110.—(1) No person shall organise or conduct a casino marketing arrangement
which involves the participation of any citizen of Singapore or permanent
resident of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A
“casino marketing arrangement” is defined in s 2(1) of the CCA (with
particular reference to s 2(1)(<em>a</em>))
as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… an arrangement whereby a person organises,
promotes or facilitates the playing of any game in a casino by one
or more patrons, for which the first-mentioned person receives from
the casino operator or from the person for the time being in charge
of the casino</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    a commission based on
the turnover of play in the casino attributable to the patron or
patrons or otherwise derived from the play of the patron or patrons;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It
will be recalled that the basic position of the Defendant in the
First Suit was that the Plaintiff had opened an account at MBS and
that he would from time to time withdraw non-negotiable chips to
pass to friends and business associates to use for gaming purposes.
By doing this, the Plaintiff was said to have earned a rolling commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Assuming
that the Plaintiff was acting contrary to s 108(9)(<em>a</em>)
of the CCA, the Defendant’s submission was that the Plaintiff was
also caught by s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev
Ed) (“MLA”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.—(2) where any contract for a loan has
been granted by an unlicensed moneylender, or any guarantee or security
has been given for such a loan —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) the
contract for the loan, and the guarantee or security, as the case may
be, shall be unenforceable; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) any
money paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the
contract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In
addition, reference should also be made here to ss 5(1) and 5(6)
of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) which provide
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Agreement
by way of gaming or wagering to be null and void</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5.</b>—(1) All contracts or agreements,
whether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

reward or otherwise in respect of any such contract or of any services
in relation thereto or in connection therewith, shall be null and void,
and no action shall be brought or maintained to recover any such
sum of money</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On
this basis, the defence in the First Suit was that the alleged debt owed
was in respect of gaming arrangements that were rendered null and void
by s 14(2) of the MLA and ss 5(1) and 5(6) of the CLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
Plaintiff in the First Suit, it will be recalled, pleaded that the Defendant
owed a sum of $730,000 to Foo, which debt had been paid by Plaintiff
on behalf of the Defendant. The Defendant was said to have acknowledged
this and had undertaken to repay the Plaintiff. It will be recalled
that the Settlement Agreement for $730,000 was reached shortly after
the Plaintiff encountered difficulties in obtaining summary judgment in
the First Suit because of concerns over the Acknowledgement of Debt which
the Defendant had signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> There
was no finding by any court that the Plaintiff was in fact running
an illegal junket operation or that he was otherwise, in breach
of, or caught by provisions of the CCA, MLA or CLA. Indeed, it bears
repeating that it remains unclear as to what if any connection there
was between the debt owed to Foo and the alleged junket/gaming activities.
The allegations made by the Defendant were very serious and had
not been established at the time when the First Suit was settled.
There can be no doubt that if the First Suit had gone to trial,
there would likely have been considerable dispute over the facts
(never mind the law) over the relationship between the parties and
various “third party friends”. Even though the Defendant had made
serious allegations in the First Suit, it is important to take note
that at the time of the Settlement, there was no finding at all
of illicit moneylending and it was by no means certain that the
Defendant would have been able to establish the moneylending/gaming
defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Validity and Effect of the
Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I
come now to the crux of the legal issue which is whether the Defendant
should be allowed to raise the same illegality defence as a means of
undermining the Settlement Agreement, in arguing that the Settlement Agreement
is affected by the alleged illegality in the First Suit. This is bearing
in mind the fact that there was no conclusive finding of any illegality
in the First Suit given that parties entered into a Settlement Agreement
before this issue could be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
position of the Defendant in the Second Suit is that the validity
of the Settlement Agreement is affected or tainted by the same illegality
which made the debt irrecoverable in the First Suit, <em>ie</em>, that it was premised on a gaming and/or
moneylending contract and was, therefore, unenforceable. Parties
have raised a number of cases in support of their arguments, and
I now turn to discuss their applicability in the present case before
me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Tan Sim Lay v Lim Kiat Seng
[1996] 2 SLR(R) 147</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>Tan Sim Lay v Lim Kiat Seng</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R)
147 (“<em>Tan Sim Lay</em>”), the defendant
had admitted a debt and agreed to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff
in consideration of the plaintiff forbearing to sue on the said
debt. When the plaintiff brought an action for breach of the agreement,
the defendant averred that the agreement was a settlement agreement
arising from a series of unlawful moneylending transactions in which
the plaintiff had lent money as an unlicensed moneylender to the
defendant. The plaintiff, on the other hand, alleged that the monies
were advanced purely as investment in the defendant’s money changing
business. When the case was heard by Choo Han Teck JC (as he then
was), the learned judicial commissioner found (at [15]) that there
was not the slightest evidence that the plaintiff’s dealings with
the defendant could be regarded as conventional business investments.
The court held that the monies advanced were clearly loans and that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]nterest was payable on these loans and
were just as dubiously dubbed profits. The undisputed evidence was
that the profits were not only fixed in advance but were at a rate
up to 152% per annum, clearly exorbitant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Choo
JC, therefore, held at [20] that the plaintiff had used the term “investment”
to camouflage “blatant moneylending transactions.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In
the present case, the Defendant cites <em>Tan Sim
Lay</em> as authority for the proposition that it is not the
court’s position that the terms of a settlement agreement made between
the parties is conclusively the <em>only</em> evidence
or foundation upon which the court will decide the liability of
a defendant. The validity of the settlement agreement would depend
in part on whether the original dispute that was settled was one
which was tainted by moneylending. That said, it is to be noted
that <em>Tan Sim Lay</em> was a decision
reached after trial and was based on the finding that the plaintiff had
indeed acted as a moneylender in loaning monies to the defendant. That
being so, Choo J found that the agreement which had been entered into
for the settlement of the various moneylending transactions was caught
by the MLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In
the present case, however, there has been no finding of moneylending/gaming
in the First Suit. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the allegations
of the Defendant, it cannot be said with confidence that the moneylending/gaming
defence would have succeeded if the First Suit had gone to trial.
The question is whether the Defendant, having chosen to enter into
a settlement agreement over the First Suit, should now be entitled to
raise the same legal arguments (<em>ie</em>,
the illegality defence) which had been raised but not conclusively
decided in the First Suit. If the Defendant is entitled to raise
the same legal arguments, then at trial in the Second Suit, the
Defendant could potentially be able to establish that the $730,000 referred
to in the Settlement Agreement is in respect of gaming debts, and therefore
a serious question will arise as to whether a defence based on the MLA
and CLA is made out. However, since this was not the case in <em>Tan Sim Lay</em>, I find that it does little
to aid the Defendant’s arguments in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Quek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee
Pah Jimmy [2000] 3 SLR(R) 761</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     
          <em>Quek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee Pah Jimmy</em> [2000]
3 SLR(R) 761 (“<em>Quek Chiau Beng</em>”)
concerned a claim for monies owed (S$160,000) in respect of gaming
at a casino in Australia. The sum of money owed was apparently endorsed
on certain baccarat score cards. The plaintiff in his claim asserted
that he was a licensed junket operator at the casino and that the
defendant had obtained un-cashable rolling chips from the plaintiff’s representative.
The defendant, whilst admitting that he gambled at the casino, denied
obtaining the chips from the plaintiff. Instead, his evidence was
that the plaintiff’s father had promised to extend him credit to
gamble at the casino and that he had obtained the chips from the
plaintiff’s father. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment based
on the sum as set out on the score card (which was exhibited in
the affidavit filed in support). In holding that the monies were
not recoverable under s 5(2) of the CLA, G P Selvam J noted that
there was no mention anywhere in the documents that there was any
loan. Instead, the allegations and evidence (as pleaded and set out
in the affidavits) was that the defendant had betted on baccarat
and had lost heavily. The learned judge found (in the context of
an application for summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the ROC) that
the defendant was being sued to recover a gambling debt. That being
so, s 5(2) of the CLA applied. All contracts or agreements by way
of gaming were null and void, <em>ie</em>, <em>nudum pactum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In
coming to his decision, the learned judge commented at [8] that the
gaming section of CLA did not render gambling illegal as such. The purpose
was to put down gambling on credit. He stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It means that the winner has no legal remedy
against the loser to recover his wins. Illegality and ineffectiveness,
that is nullity, are two different concepts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… under the gaming section our courts are
not allowed to collect gambling debts for casinos and junket operators.
The courts will not permit a gambling debt to sneak in in disguise,
eg as a loan or sale contract for chips.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Selvam
J observed at [15] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he evidence (including the evidence
of the defendant) show that what is sought is a gambling loss. When
counsel spoke of a loan it was his wishful thinking… when was a
loan made? How much money was given as a loan? Where was it given?
Who gave it? What was the currency of the loan? There is no hint
of any of these matters in the pleadings or the affidavits. The
reality of the situation was that there was a gaming debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     That
being so, the defendant was granted unconditional leave to defend
(reversing the decision below which had granted conditional leave).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Whilst
it is understandable for the Defendant in the present case to cite <em>Quek Chiau Beng</em>, it is to be noted that
on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits it was <em>clear</em> to
Selvam J that the debt was not incurred by way of a loan – it was
a gambling debt which arose out of bets placed on baccarat at the
Australian casino. That being so, unconditional leave to defend
was granted as the defendant in <em>Quek Chiau
Beng</em> appeared to have a good defence based on the evidence
before the court. In the present case, the Plaintiff’s claim in
the First Suit was for recovery of a debt said to have been acknowledged
by the Defendant. Whilst the Defendant has made assertions that
the basis of the First Suit in fact concerned an illicit junket
operation and gaming, this was never conclusively established. In
the Plaintiff’s written submissions in Sum 3506 (the application
for summary judgment), the Plaintiff went on to argue that even
if he had been running an unauthorised junket scheme in Singapore,
this had no bearing on the debt which the Defendant owed to the
Plaintiff. That said, it bears repeating that the Plaintiff has,
in general terms, joined issue with the Defendant and that an important
reason as to why the AR declined to award summary judgment was because
the acknowledgement note fell just short of what was needed to rebut
the assertion that the transaction underlying the settlement was
unlicensed money lending.  In contrast, Selvam J was not dealing
with a case where the claim was to enforce the terms of a settlement
agreement: which agreement had been entered into to settle an earlier
dispute in which there were <em>unproven</em> allegations
of moneylending and gaming. Instead, <em>Quek Chiau
Beng</em> concerned an application for summary judgment to recover
a sum of money <em>which on the pleadings and affidavits
before the court concerned a gambling debt</em>. It was in
this context that Selvam J held that for the purposes of s 5(2)
CLA, it made no difference that the gaming was carried out with
gaming chips and not cash. (Gaming chips are not money or money’s
worth but counters for tracking the losses and wins.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Star Cruises Services Ltd v
Overseas Union Bank Ltd [1999] 2 SLR(R) 183</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     
          <em>Star Cruises Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd</em> [1999]
2 SLR(R) 183 (“<em>Star Cruises</em>”) is
another decision by Selvam J on the effect of a contract arising
out of gaming. In that case, the plaintiff casino operator claimed
a sum of money from the defendant bank (OUB) in respect of three cashier’s
orders issued by OUB to the plaintiff. OUB in turn claimed that the
cashier’s orders had been fraudulently issued by an employee in connection
with gambling transactions. In coming to his decision (in favour
of OUB), the learned judge set out a helpful summary of the public policy
reasons for the law’s aversion to gaming and wagering contracts
and the attempts to circumvent rules against recovery of gambling
debts by lending monies to gamblers and attempts to recover the
gaming debts by means of a claim for repayment of a loan. Selvam
J noted s 6(1)(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) (which
later was amended to the current s 5(1)(2) of CLA) and commented
(at [68]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [g]aming debts are not legal debts. The
courts of justice are out of bounds to claims based on gaming or
wagering because no action can be brought or maintained to enforce
them. The doors of justice are closed to them. Sections 6(2) and
6(5) have clamped down on credit gambling by denying legal remedy
to enforce gaming debts and securities based on them. It has done
so for public policy reasons with a history of some 450 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The
learned judge continues at [69] by holding that the clamp down</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… includes the accessory contracts before
the actual game and derivative contracts after the play. In the
case of a composite-contract, if the gaming contract is the central
or matrix contract, the whole composite-contract comprising the
central, accessory and derivative contracts are voided …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
decision in <em>Star Cruises</em> arose after
a trial which led Selvam J hold (at [105]) that all the cashier’s
orders represented gaming losses <em>ie</em>,
money won by way of gambling at the plaintiff’s casino. In the present
case, there has yet to be a trial and the application is for summary
judgment based on the written terms of a Settlement Agreement. The
Settlement Agreement does not on its face indicate or state that
the payments to be made are in respect of gaming losses. That said,
the Settlement Agreement clearly concerns and relates to the claims
brought in the First Suit where gaming assertions had been made
(but not yet established) by the Defendant. As I had observed earlier,
the real issue before this court is whether (in the context of an
application for summary judgment) the Defendant should be allowed
or given another opportunity to raise the same (<em>unproven</em>)
gaming issues that were supposedly settled by agreement. Is this
a case where the court should adopt a holistic approach and look
at the Settlement Agreement in the context of the alleged transactions
as a whole so as to take a composite approach? If so, the fact that
the characteristics of the alleged earlier transaction (the circumstances
in which the debt arose that was the subject of the First Suit)
is unclear and in real dispute must also be a relevant consideration
as is discussed below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace
Inc [2010] 1 SLR 1129</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     
          <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc</em> [2010]
1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Poh Soon Kiat</em>”) was
a case where Desert Palace Inc (the respondent) had brought a suit
in Singapore against the appellant in respect of which an application
for summary judgment was made. The suit was based on a claim to
enforce a foreign judgment obtained in 2001 in the State of California,
USA. The Californian judgment had set aside a transfer of property
by the appellant (on the basis of fraud) and had also ordered the
property to be sold and for the sale proceeds to be made available
to satisfy judgment debts owing to the Respondent obtained in 1999
(from the same court). The judgment obtained in 1999 was itself
based on an earlier US District Court (Nevada) decision that was
based on a gambling debt owed by the appellant to the respondent.
The High Court in Singapore found for the Respondent on the basis
that the 2001 Californian judgment was enforceable in Singapore
and that there was no defence to the action. On appeal, Chan Sek
Keong CJ surveyed the Singapore law and public policy on gambling
and came to the conclusion (at [95]) that the introduction of casino
gambling in Singapore under strict controls did not abrogate the
public policy that was encapsulated in s 5(2) of the CLA. The Chief
Justice continued (at [97] and [98]) that there was a clear difference
between regulated casino gambling and unregulated gaming at large
(including gambling on credit) and that “the existence of regulated
gambling is not inconsistent with unregulated gambling and gambling
on credit being against public policy in Singapore.” That said,
the Court of Appeal held (at [127]) that the 2001 Californian judgment
was not enforceable by way of a common law action as it was not a
foreign money judgment. The Court of Appeal went on to observe (in <em>dicta</em>) however, that it appeared that
s 5(2) CLA would also have barred the action since the action on
the foreign judgment was based on an underlying cause of action
concerning a gambling debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In
coming to its decision, the Court of Appeal in <em>Poh
Soon Kiat</em> referred to the earlier decisions of <em>Star City Pty Ltd (formerly known as Sydney Harbour
Casino Pty Ltd) v Tan Hong Woon</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 306 (“<em>Star City</em>”) and <em>Burswood
Nominees Ltd v Liao Eng Kiat</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 436 (“<em>Burswood</em>”). In <em>Star
City</em>, the Court of Appeal (at [30]) came to the view
that Singapore (in line with the position in England) had departed from
the historical position that gambling and gaming, especially on
credit, was a social vice that had to be eradicated at all costs.
Yong Pung How CJ at [30] expressed the view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[g]ambling <em>per se</em> is
no longer considered to be contrary to the public interest and this
accounts for the various forms of legalised gaming and gambling
which currently exists in Singapore such as 4-D, Toto, the Big Sweep,
the Singapore Turf Club, <em>etc</em>. Therefore
there is no general principle of public policy in Singapore, against
the recovery of money lent for the purposes of gambling abroad,
so long if (<em>sic</em>) the transaction
is indeed a genuine loan and one which is valid and enforceable
according to that foreign law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
latter statement may now need to be reassessed in the light of the <em>dicta</em> comments in <em>Poh
Soon Kiat</em>. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that even in <em>Star City</em>, Yong Pung How CJ went on to
affirm (at [31]) that what was objectionable “is courts being used
by casinos to enforce gambling debts in the ‘form’ of loans” and
that “the courts of justice must remain out of bounds to claims
for moneys won upon wagers, however cleverly or covertly disguised.”
The important point to note is that the “distinction” touched on
in the latter case between gaming debts (monies lost on wagers) and
genuine loans to a borrower who uses the monies to gamble will doubtless
require careful thought, even in those cases where the loan is valid and
enforceable according to applicable foreign law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Burswood</em>, the plaintiff was the operator
of a licensed casino in Western Australia. The defendant had issued
a cheque to the plaintiff in exchange for a chip voucher. Subsequently,
the defendant lost the chips on the gaming tables and his cheque
when presented for payment was dishonoured. The plaintiff obtained
a default judgment in a Western Australian court. The issue before
the Singapore court was whether the Western Australian judgment
was registrable under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth
Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RECJA”). Section 3(2)(f)
of the RECJA prohibits the registration of a Commonwealth judgment
if it was obtained in respect of a cause of action which for reasons
of public policy could not be entertained by a Singapore court.
The Court of Appeal in that case held that the plaintiff’s claim
was for money won upon a wager and that if the plaintiff had commenced
an action in Singapore on the dishonoured cheque that action would
have been barred by s 5(2) of the CLA. However, the Court of Appeal
went to state that s 5(2) was not applicable to the Western Australian
judgment. Instead, s 3(2)(f) was applicable and was decisive of
the issue, the point being that an objection based on the latter
required a higher threshold of public policy to be met. The Court
of Appeal in <em>Burswood</em> (at [46])
was of the view that there were no public policy grounds militating
against the registration of the Australian judgment which would
offend a fundamental principle of justice or a deep rooted tradition
of Singapore. In <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em>,
a differently constituted Court of Appeal (at [94]) disagreed with
the statement that gambling was no longer contrary to Singapore
public policy. If that was the position, there would have been no
need for such an extensive and detailed legislative and regulatory
framework as set out in the CCA. Rather than repealing s 5 of the
CLA, Parliament restructured s 5 so as to make ss 5(1) and (2) inapplicable
to regulated gambling. Further, the Court of Appeal in <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em> took pains to stress that
the public policy objection encapsulated in s 5(2) CLA was not simply
the saving of precious judicial resources. Broader public interests
lay at the heart of the provision. The decision in <em>Burswood</em> was
characterised as unsound since the cause of action upon which the
Western Australian judgment was based was a gambling debt. Section
5(2) CLA applied to all gambling debts and was clear expression
of Singapore public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In
the present case, the claim is not being brought by a casino against a
patron who has incurred gaming losses at the casino tables. Taking
the Defendant’s pleaded case at its highest, what is being alleged
is that the Plaintiff provided chips to his friends and business
acquaintances to gamble at a casino in Singapore. Over time, the
Plaintiff became indebted to the casino and sought to recover the
“credit” that he had provided to these friends and associates. How
the Defendant “fit” into the scheme was not entirely clear. The
point is that if the First Suit had not been settled and had proceeded
to a full trial, there would likely have been careful examination
of the evidence to determine the facts (what was the relationship
between Foo, the Plaintiff and Defendant; was it a genuine loan
transaction or something else <em>etc</em>)
and subsequently the law as applicable to gaming debts and loans. The
question (broadly stated) before the court (as set out before) is
whether having settled the First Suit, the Defendant can or should
be allowed to raise the very same set of issues again as a means
of undermining the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd
v East Coast Properties Pte Ltd [2011] 2 SLR 758</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     
          <em>Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd v East Coast Properties
Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 758 (“<em>Real
Estate Consortium</em>”) concerned the question as to the degree
of finality to be accorded to settlement agreements (in terms of preventing
parties from re-opening issues supposed to have been settled). The
case concerned disputes which had arisen from a convertible bond agreement
between the plaintiff and the defendants (“the CBA”). About a year
after the CBA was executed, the defendants were unable to repay
the principal amount as a result of which the plaintiff by letter
terminated the CBA. The defendants disputed the plaintiff’s rights
under the CBA. They also alleged that the CBA had been signed by
the second defendant without fully understanding the terms that
the CBA was a sham transaction, that the CBA was an unenforceable
moneylending transaction with an exorbitant interest rate and that
the CBA had wrongly terminated. Thereafter, the parties entered
into negotiations to settle the dispute and, after an exchange of
correspondence, an instalment re-payment schedule was agreed with four
post-dated cheques being delivered to the plaintiff. Three of these cheques
were subsequently dishonoured. The defendants’ case was to raise similar
points on the CBA (<em>ie</em>, that it was
an act of moneylending, and that it was a sham <em>etc</em>)
as well as an assertion that the settlement agreement was not valid
as it had been entered into under economic duress. The plaintiff denied
economic duress and claimed that the issues concerning the validity of
the CBA were no longer relevant as they had been settled between
the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Andrew
Ang J found (at [42]) that it was clear that the issues had been compromised
by a settlement agreement between the parties. The legal question
that arose was whether the settlement agreement had the effect of preventing
the defendants from resurrecting the same issues again. The learned
judge held that they were precluded, and stated at [53] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [w]here parties have agreed to resolve
their dispute amicably by way of a validly formed settlement agreement,
the settlement agreement alone governs the parties' legal relationship;
the effect of the settlement agreement is to put an end to the issues
previously raised by the defendants. This oft-stated principle has
been regarded as self-evident as its rationale has seldom been adequately
articulated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Whilst
the rationale may not have been often explained, there is little doubt
that there is much good sense in the principle. If an agreement
was validly and properly entered into by way of compromising an
action, the common intention of the parties must have been to compromise
that action in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If the
terms of the agreement make it clear that the settlement agreement
was to exclusively govern the dispute and issues that had arisen
then that should be it and neither side will ordinarily be allowed
to renege from what had been agreed. If it is intended that some
issues remain “live” (either generally or in certain circumstances)
then this should be provided for in the agreement itself (although
in some cases it may be that an appropriate term may be implied).
Whether the basis for upholding the settlement agreement is contract
or some form of estoppel (which Andrew Ang J at [58] in <em>Real Estate Consortium</em> expressed some
doubt towards), there can be no doubting the good sense (and arguments
of public interest) in the law upholding agreements freely entered
into as part of the process of dispute resolution and in the interests
of commercial certainty. Indeed, this was a point that was discussed
in some detail by Andrew Ang J at [58] and [59] of <em>Real
Estate Consortium</em>. Singapore cases cited by the learned
judge as supporting this view include <em>Gay Choon
Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332, <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003] 3
SLR(R) 8, and <em>Shunmugam Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam
Joshua Benjamin</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 658.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     That
said, it must follow that, whilst the general rule is that the settlement
agreement alone will govern the relationship between the parties,
there will be a residue of cases where the settlement agreement <em>will not</em> have the effect of preventing
the re-opening of disputes. The case cited for this proposition
is the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Binder
v Alachouzos</em> [1972] 2 QB 151 (“<em>Binder</em>”).
That was a case where a lender had commenced an action against the
borrower for default in the repayment of loans. The borrower’s defence
was that the loans were unenforceable. Before the trial, the action
was settled on terms that the borrower should make payment of a
sum of money by way of instalments. It was agreed that the Moneylenders
Act did not apply to the loan transactions. In that case, Lord Denning
MR found that the dispute as to whether the lender was a moneylender
had already formed the subject matter of a <em>bona
fide</em> compromise agreement. It followed that the dispute
could not be reopened unless the lender had taken “unfair advantage”
of the borrower. One such instance given by Lord Denning was a case
where the interest charged was so high that it was presumed to be
harsh and unconscionable. But, and this is of some importance for
the case at hand, Lord Denning also stated at 158 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[o]n the other hand, it is important that
the courts should enforce compromises which are agreed in good faith
between the lender and borrower. If the court is satisfied that
the terms are fair and reasonable, then the compromise should be
held binding. For instance, if there is a genuine difference as
to whether the lender is a moneylender or not, then it is open to the
parties to enter into a bona fide agreement of compromise. Otherwise, there
could never be a compromise of such an action. Every case would
have to go to the court for final determination and decision. That
cannot be right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Andrew
Ang J in <em>Real Estate Consortium</em> accepted
that a compromise agreement was not an absolute bar to reopening
of issues. Nevertheless, the learned judge rightly stressed at [61]
that inasmuch as the court will not make a contract for the parties,
that there was only <em>limited</em> scope
for the court to determine whether the terms of the compromise was
fair and reasonable. Examples given were cases where the prior issues
were tainted by illegality, fraud, duress, undue influence or mistake.
 At the end of the day, Andrew Ang J found that the parties had
intended to enter into the settlement agreement and that there was
no basis for the claim that the agreement was entered into under
economic duress. It was always open (at the time) for the defendants
to have defended the claim and in any case the defendants had the
benefit of independent legal advice throughout the settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Whilst
the relevance of <em>Real Estate Consortium</em> to
the present case is clear, it is necessary to bear in mind that
the latter was a case that went to trial and the decision reached
only after the normal trial process was complete. <em>Real
Estate Consortium</em> was not a case where the matter was determined
on an application for summary judgment. The fact that there was
a full trial which enabled Andrew Ang J to hold that even if he
accepted (for the sake of argument) that the issues could be re-opened,
the end result would have been the same. This is because the court
in any case found (after trial) that there was no merit in the arguments
that had been raised. There was no basis for the plea of mistake,
nor was there evidence to show that the second defendant was inexperienced.
The evidence that the CBA was a sham was not accepted as the evidence
showed that the defendants regarded the plaintiff’s financing as
an investment in the property project. That being so, the allegation
of moneylending was not made out. That said, it is clear that the
learned judge’s remarks and comments on the merit of the issues
previously raised were by way of caution and that his main holding
remains: that there is only limited room to reopen issues that have been
included in a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Now
that I have discussed a number of cases counsel cited to me, I now
apply the legal principles to the facts of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As
noted earlier, the Settlement Agreement in the present case was signed
by both parties on 1 February 2013. The signatures were in the presence
of two witnesses. Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[s]ubject to the above, the parties agree
that the Suit is fully and finally settled as between them. This
Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with,
the laws of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The
Suit referred to was identified in the opening paragraph of the agreement
as “S733/2012/J”. This, of course, is a direct reference to the
First Suit discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     On
5 February 2013, the solicitors for the Plaintiff sent a letter
to the solicitors for the Defendant noting and setting out the terms
of the Settlement Agreement of 1 February 2013. By this letter,
the Plaintiff sought confirmation of the settlement and that, if
the sums were not paid as provided for, the Defendant would become
liable for all amounts not so paid. By a letter on the same date,
the solicitors for the Defendant replied confirming the settlement
including the provision that if the settlement payments were not
paid as provided for, the Defendant would “forthwith become liable
for all amounts not so paid and your client may enforce such obligation
against him.” It is clear and beyond dispute that the parties had taken
independent legal advice by 5 February 2013. Indeed, the Defendant, in
his first affidavit, makes express reference to the fact that he
had given certain instructions on the settlement agreement to his
solicitors. This suggests strongly that he had the benefit of legal
counsel earlier and certainly by around the 1 February 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Aside
from having the benefit of legal counsel, there is no doubt that the
Defendant had partly performed the Settlement Agreement by causing the
transfer of the Firstlink Shares to the Plaintiff in performance
of one of his obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Even though
the transfer was late (occurring on 28 February 2013), the Plaintiff
points out that at the time when the share transfer forms were delivered,
there was no indication that this transfer was to meet obligations
owed by friends of the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Indeed there is no
evidence that the transfer was made under any form of protest. There
is also no dispute that the Plaintiff performed his obligation under
the Settlement Agreement by discontinuing the First Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The
cash payments under the Settlement Agreement were due by 28 February
2013 and 31 March 2013. Both of these were not made. Letters of demand
were sent by the solicitors for the Plaintiff to the Defendant on
5<sup></sup>March 2013 and 10 April 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     On
17 April 2013, the solicitors for the Defendant replied to the letter of
demand of 10 April 2013 as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    We
are instructed that our client cannot understand why your client insists
on threatening legal action. We are instructed that fundamental
to the settlement of Suit 733/2012/J was the understanding that
our client would be transferring the sum of $330,000 to your client
once he had collected the same from all the other parties indebted
to your client. The circumstances of such indebtedness by such third
parties have been expressed lucidly in the discontinued Suit 733/2012/J.
You will agree that no other person was named or made a party to
the settlement agreement executed upon the discontinuance of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In
the Plaintiff’s Affidavit in Reply dated 12 August 2013 (“LYK RA”), the
existence of an informal oral agreement was denied. Points raised
by the Plaintiff (aside from the fact that the Settlement Agreement
was voluntarily entered into by the Defendant with assistance of
legal advice) include the observation that the Defendant provided
few details to substantiate or provide credence to the allegation
that the debts were those of friends who had gambled with the Plaintiff’s
chips. The identity of the friends from whom the Defendant was supposed
to attempt recovery of the debts was not revealed until the Defendant
filed his reply affidavit on 24 July 2013 resisting Sum 3506 (“TVL-AF”).
Even then only one person was named. The other friend was simply
described as a “female friend.” The explanation for the Defendant’s
reticence was that he was concerned that if he named the female
friend that this would “sour” his relationship with her as well
as worsen his relationship with the Plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The
Defendant also states that he does not name these friends as he
did not want to “drag them into the mud of litigation.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Up
to a certain point, the Defendant’s apparent reticence to name the
third party friends is perhaps somewhat understandable. The failure
to provide details does not necessarily force the conclusion that
the oral understanding was a fabrication. Nevertheless, this court
is bound to note that by 5 February 2013, the Plaintiff and Defendant were
in the midst of a serious dispute and that the Defendant must have been
aware of the implications of the Settlement Agreement (taken on
at face value). Given the terms of the Settlement Agreement and
the history of the dispute (from the perspective of the Defendant),
the importance of the alleged oral understanding is obvious. It
is for this reason that the absence of details and supporting evidence
for the oral understanding and the debts of the friends is a cause
for some concern.  Indeed, the Plaintiff’s solicitors, by letter
dated 18 April 2013 (in reply to the Defendant’s solicitor letter
of 17 April 2013), denied the allegation that there was some sort
of understanding and noted that no particulars had been provided
as to who these other parties were who were alleged indebted to
the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In
LYK RA, the Plaintiff exhibited and made reference to a number of SMS
messages exchanged between himself and the Defendant. The point that
the Plaintiff sought to make was that nowhere in these messages
is there any reference or suggestion that an oral understanding
existed whereby the Defendant was to recover the debts from third
party friends and to hand the same over to the Plaintiff. The SMS
messages referred to were dated 21 January 2013, 28 February 2013,
1, 4 and 5 March 2013. Whilst the exhibited messages offer some
support for the Plaintiff’s position, this court is bound to note
that only portions of the messages appear to be exhibited and there
is no telling as to whether there are other SMS messages or emails <em>etc</em> which may be relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In
his grounds of decision, the AR’s view was that there was simply
no evidence to support the existence of the oral agreement which
would allow the AR to place any weight on the assertion for the
purposes of the application for summary judgment. The AR’s comment
that the Defendant had only made a “bare assertion” that there was
some oral agreement is justified even if the court disregards the
exhibited SMS chain of messages referred to above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The
conclusion that this court has come to is that the Defendant did freely
enter into the Settlement Agreement of 1 February 2013 and as referred
to in the exchange of letters dated 5 February 2013. There is no evidence
to support the Defendant’s assertion that the Settlement Agreement
was subject to or governed by an unrecorded/undocumented oral contract
or understanding. Even if there was some evidence of an oral understanding,
the parol evidence rule would have to be considered. The alleged
oral understanding is clearly inconsistent with the written terms
of the Settlement Agreement. To be clear, this court is not deciding
this appeal simply on the basis of the parol evidence rule. Instead,
the decision is based on the view that the existence of the Settlement
Agreement has been firmly established and that there is no basis
for doubting its terms and obligations and subjecting performance
to some informal, oral understanding which fundamentally alters
what was expressly provided and for which there is no supporting
evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It
follows that I am not satisfied that the Defendant has shown that leave
to defend (unconditional or otherwise) should be granted on the
basis of the alleged oral understanding or agreement referred to
above. Instead, much will depend on whether the Defendant has demonstrated
some other basis for attacking the Settlement Agreement. That basis
is said to be based on the gaming/moneylending issues which arose
in connection with the First Suit and which the Defendant now seeks
to rely on so as to impugn the enforceability of the Settlement
Agreement. I now turn to discuss this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Taking
the Defendant’s pleaded case at its highest, the defence raised in
the First Suit turned on the broad allegation that the Plaintiff
had been running an unlicensed junket operation at Marina Bay Sands
and thereby came within the ambit of the MLA and CLA. The debt/loan
which the Plaintiff was claiming in the First Suit was said to have
“arisen” out these gaming activities such that even if the Defendant
owed the money, the claim was unenforceable. The Plaintiff asserts
that the money owed derived from a debt which the Defendant owed
to Foo and which had been paid by the Plaintiff on behalf of the
Defendant. The Plaintiff denies that there is any connection between
this and the alleged illicit junket operation. The positions taken
by the parties in the First Suit are sharply conflicting. If the Defendant
had succeeded at trial in showing that the monies were gambling debts
arising in the course of an illicit junket operation, relying on
the case law discussed earlier, this would have assisted the Defendant
in trying to establish a defence at law. This court is not holding
that on the basis of what was pleaded and asserted by the Defendant
in the First Suit, the unlicensed moneylending defence would have
succeeded as a matter of law if the First Suit had gone to trial.
The key point is that at the time the First Suit was settled, it
was <em>far from clear</em> as to whose version
of events would be established at trial. Even if the Plaintiff was
involved in some form of junket scheme, it was not clear as to what
the connection was between the Defendant, Foo and the junket operation.
In short, the First Suit was settled at a point when there was a
serious dispute as to whether the claim related to moneylending,
junket operations and gaming losses. The fact that a claim for summary
judgment in the First Suit was unlikely to succeed does not mean
that the Plaintiff’s claim or version of the events was flawed or inherently
unbelievable. Indeed, the court is reminded that the Defendant did
not in the First Suit take out an application for striking out.
The fact that the Plaintiff agreed to settle the First Suit does
not mean that the Plaintiff thereby admitted all the allegations
and points of defence which were raised in the First Suit. It is
also noted that the First Suit was for the sum of $730,000. The
Settlement Agreement reached was for the <em>full</em> amount
of the claim. What the Defendant had secured was agreement that the
claim would be satisfied by means of a transfer of shares and two instalment
payments of cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     To
be clear, if the First Suit was indeed a claim for recovery of sums owed
by the Defendant in respect of gaming losses arising out of the
junket operation (meaning that if this was admitted by the Plaintiff
or if the evidence was clear beyond doubt), this court accepts that
the Defendant may well have enjoyed the defence that he had asserted.
If in <em>these</em> circumstances, the Plaintiff
had entered into a Settlement Agreement, an arguable case might
have been made that the Settlement Agreement was not “absolute”
and that the same public policy objections to the First Suit carried
through and tainted the Second Suit. The point, however, is these are
not the circumstances in which the First Suit was settled. The Plaintiff has
never admitted that the claim was in respect of gaming losses and
would no doubt have disputed the applicability of the MLA and CLA
if the case had gone to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The
court reminds itself of the decision of the English Court of Appeal
in <em>Binder</em> referred to earlier. 
It will be recalled that in that case, Lord Denning MR found that
the dispute as to whether the lender was a moneylender had already
formed the subject matter of a <em>bona fide</em> compromise
agreement. It followed that the dispute could not be reopened unless
the lender had taken “unfair advantage” of the borrower.  It also follows
that there is huge difference between a settlement reached when there
is a genuine dispute as to whether the lender is a moneylender and
a case where the settlement agreement accepts or is founded on established unlicensed
moneylending. In the same case, Phillimore LJ (at 159) commented:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is said that this court ought to look
behind the terms drawn up to represent the agreement between the
parties – an agreement freely negotiated and signed by all concerned.
[Counsel] says that there are matters which cast an aroma of moneylending
over the whole of these transactions … Speaking for myself, I think
it is entirely plain that this was a bona fide compromise and that
there is nothing in evidence here which could make this court say <em>with any confidence</em> that these were moneylending
transactions, illegal transactions … The terms of the agreement
are not to be described as colorable. The court ought to be very
slow to look behind an agreement reached in circumstances as these…”
[emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In
a similar vein, the remarks of Roskill LJ in <em>Binder</em> at
160 are worth repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment it is the law of this country,
as Lord Denning MR has said, where there is a bona fide compromise
of an existing dispute and that compromise includes a compromise
of what … is basically an issue of fact, namely whether or not there
had been unlawful moneylending, especially where the compromise
has been reached under the advice of counsel and solicitors, that
that compromise is enforceable against the party seeking to repudiate
it. Any other course would cause very great difficulty in the administration
of justice. One example will suffice: subject to the sanction of the
Court, a liquidator is entitled to compromise a dispute with debtors… What
is he supposed to do if he is met by the defence that the debt or supposed
debt arose from unlawful moneylending? Must he refuse to compromise?
What is the court to do? Must the court refuse to sanction a compromise
because it can always be reopened later … In such a case it seems
to me clear that the court should encourage and when appropriate enforce
any bona fide compromise arrived at, especially one arrived at under legal
advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Returning
briefly to the decision of Andrew Ang J in <em>Real
Estate Consortium</em>, it will be recalled that the learned
judge accepted that a compromise agreement was not an absolute bar
to reopening of issues. That said, the Court rightly stressed that
there was only <em>limited</em> scope for
the court to determine whether the terms of the compromise were
fair and reasonable. Examples given were cases where the prior issues
were tainted by illegality, fraud, duress, undue influence or mistake.
 It follows that where the suit that was settled/compromised was <em>clearly</em> tainted by illegality, the settlement
agreement might itself be affected by the illegality. The position
is different, however, where there is a <em>genuine
dispute</em> as to whether there is moneylending or gaming
or some illegality that affects the original claim. When there is
a <em>genuine dispute</em> as to whether
an illegality defence might have applied in the previous case, then,
there may be a greater argument that any settlement between the
parties would be a truly <em>bona fide</em> one
because of parties’ differing legal positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I
pause now to take stock and emphasise the principles of law, and propose
a suitable framework to analyse them in. Drawing from the cases
I have discussed above, I find that these principles are helpful
in deciding whether or not a party should be allowed to impugn a
settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     Where
parties have agreed to resolve their dispute amicably by way of
a validly formed settlement agreement, the settlement agreement <em>alone</em> governs the parties' legal relationship
in the absence of the above vitiating factors (applying <em>Real Estate Consortium</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     Because
the settlement agreement <em>alone</em> governs
the parties’ legal relationship, <em>prima facie</em>,
parties should not be allowed to rely on anything outside of this
legal relationship in attempting to impugn the settlement agreement.
This would mean any disputed legal issues (supposedly settled) would
have no, or at the most little, bearing on the legality or formation
of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a>(c)     A
settlement agreement is ultimately premised on the law of contract.
There is a <em>limited</em> scope for the
court to determine whether the terms of the compromise are fair
and reasonable in deciding whether the settlement agreement should
not be enforced. This limited scope includes grounds by which normal
contracts are usually challenged, such as because of duress, illegality <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_d"></a>(d)     Therefore,
a party arguing to set aside or challenge the settlement agreement
must satisfy the court that such grounds exist, before the settlement
agreement will be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     To
address the issue raised in this case directly, whether or not the Defendant
can “rely” on the illegality defence raised in the First Suit, is therefore
somewhat of a misleading question. Because the Settlement Agreement
now purely governs the legal relationship between the parties, technically,
the Defendant is not allowed to “re-open” the issues raised in the
First Suit. However, since the facts leading to any alleged illegality would,
in most cases, be essentially the same set of facts leading to the
legal issues raised in the First Suit, the court must look at those
set of facts (as alleged and contested) to determine whether or
not the Settlement Agreement is ultimately tainted by illegality.
The burden of proof, therefore, must still lie with the party resisting
the enforcement of a settlement agreement, in showing how the settlement
agreement was premised on circumstances which would afford him the
defence of illegality, such that the court will not enforce the
settlement agreement. In this way, there is no “white-washing” of
any illegality as the court must still look at what will be most
of the time the same set of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Applying
these principles to the case at hand, given the Settlement Agreement
between the parties, it will <em>prima</em> facie
govern the legal relationship between the parties. The question
that lies before the court is whether the Defendant has shown that
the Settlement Agreement was premised on illegal circumstances,
or that the Plaintiff has taken an “unfair advantage” such that
the Settlement Agreement should not be enforced. As to the point
of illegality, all the Defendant has done is to rely on essentially the
same facts and arguments which were in issue and dispute and raised
in the First Suit, and nothing more. The conclusion that this court
has come to is that there was a real dispute as to whether the claim
was essentially for gaming debts and so caught by the MLA and CLA.
 These are the circumstances in which the Settlement Agreement was
entered into, and based on the arguments and the evidence before
me alone, I am not satisfied that the Defendant has shown that the
Settlement Agreement was tainted by illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Since
the Defendant has failed to show how the Settlement Agreement is
tainted by illegality, it remains for this court to investigate whether
the Plaintiff had in some way taken “unfair advantage” of the Defendant
(applying <em>Real Estate Consortium</em>).
Factors which I have taken note of in reaching my decision on this
include the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     That
the Defendant accepts that he had voluntarily entered into the Settlement
Agreement (see TVL-AF at [54] where the Defendant states that he
voluntarily signed the Settlement Agreement but adds that the agreement
was primarily premised on an illegal gaming debt).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
the language and meaning of the wording of the Settlement Agreement
is clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
the Defendant had the benefit of legal counsel. At the very least,
when the letters were exchanged by the parties solicitors on 5 February
2013 there can be no doubt that the Defendant had engaged counsel
on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     That
the Defendant had in a sense partly performed the Settlement Agreement
by transferring the Firstlink shares (albeit late).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_e"></a>(e)     That
the Plaintiff did perform his side of the agreement by discontinuing
the First Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I
also take into consideration the AR’s comments in granting the Defendant
conditional leave to defend, where he described the defence of unlicensed
moneylending as being “shadowy” in nature. If by this the AR was
referring to the First Suit, it must follow that the Plaintiff would
have been entitled to settle the First Suit on the terms as set
out in the Settlement Agreement. Indeed, it is noted that the AR
went on to state that he granted conditional leave because the evidence
embodied in the acknowledgment note and cheque image fell just short
of what was required to rebut the assertion of unlicensed moneylending.
The AR may well be justified in taking this view. Nevertheless,
the point remains that there was at the very least a genuine dispute
in the First Suit as to whether there was unlicensed moneylending
that affected the Plaintiff’s claim. The “shadowy” nature of the
defence in the First Suit provides the context for what appears
to be a legitimate settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Given
the points I have observed and the context behind the Settlement
Agreement, there is no basis for an argument that the Defendant has
been unfairly taken advantage of in coming to the Settlement Agreement.
As in <em>Real Estate Consortium</em>, there
is no evidence that the Plaintiff subjected the Defendant to any
form of economic duress and that, on the facts, it is clear that
the Defendant could have chosen to defend the First Suit by trying
to establish his allegations of gaming, junket operations and moneylending.
Whether he would have succeeded is speculative. What is not speculative
is that the Defendant entered into the Settlement Agreement knowing
full well what the written terms meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     That
being so, the Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment since there
is no reason to conclude that the Settlement Agreement was tainted by
illegality, unfair or unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     For
the sake of completeness, it is noted that in the Second Suit, the Defendant
by Summons No 4218 of 2013 applied to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim
for non-satisfaction of the Settlement Agreement. The AR heard the striking
out summons together with the application for summary judgment.
The application to strike out was dismissed and the Defendant was
granted conditional leave to defend. There was no appeal against
the dismissal of the striking out application. On the question of
costs, the Plaintiff in the written submissions sought an award
of costs on a full indemnity basis. This was because the Defendant
had attempted to raise irrelevant considerations in challenging
the validity of the Settlement Agreement. These considerations were
said to be the issues on unlicensed moneylending as well as the
attempt to impugn the written agreement by means of the alleged
oral understanding.  Whilst I have allowed the appeal, I do not
agree that this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs
and decline to exercise the discretion to award costs on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It
follows that the appeal is allowed. Summary judgment in the sum
of $330,000 is awarded to the Plaintiff together with interest and
costs, to be agreed on or taxed.</p>
