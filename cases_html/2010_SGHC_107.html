<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Tax raises – not surprisingly, perhaps
                    –
                    <em>contrasting</em> responses. On the one hand, –
                    and particularly from the taxpayer’s perspective – it is often
                    viewed negatively. As Hubert Monroe QC put it at the commencement of his
                    1981 Hamlyn Lectures (<em>Intolerable Inquisition? Reflections on
                        the Law of Tax</em> (Stevens &amp; Sons, 1981))
                        (“<em>Intolerable Inquisition?</em>”) at
                    p 1 (see also at p 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tax is scarcely a favourite topic. … Objections to the topic, some
                        articulated and some no more than impressions, would range from the
                        complexity and obscurity alleged to surround it to an uneasy feeling that
                        the topic is somehow distasteful and in an indeterminate way alien to those
                        principles of reason and fairness which distinguish the common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       But there is, as alluded to above, another side
                    to the coin, which is (in my view) reflected in the question mark placed after
                    the main title of the lectures just referred to. In other words, whilst, on one
                    view, tax may be viewed as an “intolerable inquisition”, there is
                    another view that can be adopted; in the learned author’s words (<em>Intolerable Inquisition?</em> at p 1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Disagreeable topic though it may be, tax has a widespread relevance.
                        Economists will happily devote time to discussing the form which tax should
                        take since tax and the system adopted for its collection have profound
                        economic effects. Those whose interests lie in the area of public finance
                        and public administration will share with economists their interest in the
                        consequences of this or that form of tax. For accountants tax is of
                        particular relevance since it is pervasive in relation to their
                        clients’ affairs: all property and all sources of income have at some
                        stage to come to terms with the demands of tax. Is not the Inland Revenue a
                        partner in every trade, business or enterprise?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Indeed, one cannot gainsay the well-established
                    public necessity for tax in general and tax law in particular which centres on,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the raising of revenue for the
                    financing of public infrastructure and redistribution (see also, for example,
                    John Tiley, <em>Revenue Law</em> (Hart Publishing,
                    6th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Revenue Law</em>”)
                    at pp 7-10). In this respect, the legal regime is <em>statutory</em> in nature. The modern income tax regime in the local
                    context dates back more than five decades. The traditional starting-point is
                    located in R B Heasman, <em>Income Tax: A Report to
                        Their Excellencies the Governors of the Malayan Union and Singapore, with
                        Recommendations, including a Draft Bill and Proposals for Administration and
                        Staffing</em> (Kuala Lumpur, Malayan Union Government Press, 1947)
                    (popularly known as “the <em>Heasman
                    Report</em>”, and hereafter referred to as such) as well as the
                        <em>Report of the Joint Committee appointed by Their
                        Excellencies the Governors of the Malayan Union and Singapore to consider
                        Mr. Heasman’s recommendations for the institution of an Income
                        Tax and to report whether, if the policy of Income Tax were adopted, the
                        principles of the legislation, a draft of which is annexed to
                        Mr. Heasman’s Report, would, in their opinion, be suitable for
                        the purpose</em> (Kuala Lumpur, Malayan Union Government Press, 1947).
                    Much has, of course, happened since but the present Income Tax Act
                    (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) finds its roots in
                    this historical setting (see also generally <em>Halsbury’s
                        Laws of Singapore – Revenue and Taxation</em> vol 16(2)
                    (LexisNexis, 2008 Reissue) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em>”) at paras 205.004–205.009 as well as
                    Andrew Halkyard and Stephen Phua Lye Huat, “Common Law Heritage and
                    Statutory Diversion – Taxation of Income in Singapore and Hong
                    Kong” [2007] SJLS 1 at 1-3 (which, as the title itself
                    suggests, contains comparative aspects as well)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Interestingly, perhaps, when income tax
                    legislation was first being considered in the local context, it was noted thus
                    (see the <em>Heasman Report</em> at para 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The possibility of the re-introduction of Income Tax in Malaya was
                        forecast early in 1946. Press and public comment tended on the whole,
                            <em>but more noticeably in Singapore</em>, towards
                        acceptance of the principle that the taxation of income is the fairest and
                        most equitable method of raising revenue, and there seems to have been
                        little disposition in the Colony to question the need for the provision of
                        social services on an adequate scale. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Apart from the historical context, the Act
                    itself embodies a coherent system that seeks to balance the contrasting views as
                    well as expectations referred to briefly above. For example, whilst income tax
                    is levied (see generally s 10 of the Act), deductions are also permitted
                    (see generally s 14 of the Act as well as below at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>–<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> in so far as
                    the various categories of deductions within that particular section are
                    concerned). However, deductions of a capital nature are generally not permitted
                    (see, in particular, s 15(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act, a
                    provision that will, in fact, figure prominently in this appeal, and which was
                    accorded a broad scope by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>T Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 618). In order, however, to meet any unfairness to the
                    taxpayer concerned in this last-mentioned regard (in particular, where the
                    capital asset concerned is a depreciating one), the Act permits – in
                    specific situations – capital allowances in favour of the taxpayer (see
                    generally Pt VI of the Act). However, as already mentioned, the entire
                    income tax regime is embodied wholly within a <em>statutory</em> framework. Hence, where the situation concerned is not
                    provided for by the Act, just as no tax can be levied, by the same token, no tax
                    concession operates in favour of the taxpayer (a clear instance of this in the
                    context of capital allowances can be found in the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>In re A B Ltd</em>
                    [1957] MLJ 143 (“<em>A B
                    Ltd</em>”) (affirming the Singapore High Court decision in
                        <em>In re A B Ltd</em>
                    [1956] MLJ 197), which we will, in fact, have occasion to consider in
                    more detail below; see also the <em>Heasman Report</em> at
                    para 32, where proposed provisions in respect of capital allowances were
                    said to “[modify] to some extent one of the cardinal principles of Income
                    Tax Law, namely, that outlay of a capital nature, however desirable from the
                    point of view of the trade or business, is not deductible in computing the
                    amount of income to be taxed”). Monroe echoes the same sentiments made at
                    the outset of the present paragraph. Although referring to the UK context, the
                    following observations by the learned author are, it is suggested, equally
                    applicable to the Singapore context (see <em>Intolerable
                        Inquisition?</em> at pp 35-36):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But there does seem to me to be a general failure of nerve: panache is
                        missing. By that I mean this: we are insufficiently interested in basic
                        principles. Who teaches tax as a coherent branch of the law? What interests
                        the profession? They will tell you all there is to know – and more
                        – about the law and the practice … But when will they base
                        advocacy on the potential coherence of the tax code? When will judges be
                        invited to construe provisions in taxing statutes as part of a scheme
                        designed, however imperfectly, to produce a reasonable result? When, in
                        short, will confidence return that, within the familiar limits of our legal
                        system, it is no less possible to predict how a tax question will be
                        answered than to suggest how a problem in the common law will be resolved?
                        When will it be possible for the practitioner to look with confidence at his
                        client, straight in the face, and say: “You know, the law on
                        occasions may be an ass, but the tax law is not currently as assinine as
                        that!” The outlook is not entirely gloomy. Largely thanks to the
                        heroic pioneering efforts of Professor Wheatcroft tax is more widely
                        taught than ever before and not just as a practical craft. Systematic and
                        comparative study must lead to increasing comprehension, comprehension to
                        coherence. In any individual case the taxpayer’s advocate may well
                        strive to win the taxpayer’s case by whatever argument is to hand. But
                        it would do less than justice to those responsible for putting the
                        Revenue’s cases to doubt their concern to present the tax code as a
                        coherent whole. If those outside the inner circle sometimes hear the theme
                        but faintly, their listening or hearing may be at fault. The Courts’
                        cooperation with Parliament may also be on the way towards achieving more
                        sensible results.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       To be sure, the very <em>nature</em> of tax legislation entails some measure of legal
                    technicality, although it should also be pointed out that the presence of legal
                    technicality does <em>not necessarily</em> mean that
                    justice and fairness cannot therefore be achieved. In this regard, the following
                    candid observations by Mr Heasman (commenting on what was to become,
                    historically, the first piece of income tax legislation in the local context)
                    are apposite (see the <em>Heasman Report</em> at
                    para 39):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was enjoined during my informal talks to make the draft Bill simple, and
                        not difficult to understand. <em>Simplicity and
                            intelligibility are undoubtedly most desirable objectives, but it is an
                            unfortunate fact that Income Tax legislation must, by its nature, be
                            abstract and technical, and can never be easy reading</em>. It is
                        concerned with the principles and methods of calculation which it is
                        difficult to express in words without an appearance of complication, or the
                        presentation of loopholes whereby tax can be avoided or evaded. The
                        intricacy of this type of legislation seems to have been a matter of concern
                        from the outset, for when Income Tax was first introduced into the United
                        Kingdom in 1799, the Government of the day sought to allay the dismay which
                        the measure might occasion by issuing as a separate publication “A
                        Plain, Short and Easy Description of the Different Clauses of the Income
                        Tax, so as to render it familiar to the meanest capacity”. The extent
                        to which this well-meant effort achieved its purpose is not officially
                        recorded. <em>However, I think the main principles of the
                            present Bill are easily understandable, and will be quickly grasped by
                            the majority</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before proceeding to consider the specific
                    issues that arise in the present appeal, one final general observation is
                    appropriate. Of all areas of the law, perhaps the law relating to tax in general
                    and income tax in particular are heavily fact-specific. It is true that facts
                    are always important in every area of the law. However, because (as we shall
                    see) it is difficult to formulate general principles in the context of income
                    tax law, the factual matrix takes on an even greater importance. This is (as we
                    shall also see) especially the case in relation to the fundamental distinction
                    that has to be drawn between capital and revenue. Nevertheless, even here, the
                    court must be careful not to slide down the slippery slope to the other extreme
                    by subscribing to the (substantively meaningless) mantra embodied in the
                    declaration that “It all depends on the facts”. In order for a
                    particular decision to be legally <em>justified</em>, legal
                    rules and principles (which contain <em>normative</em>
                    force) <em>must</em> be both formulated as well as applied.
                    Put simply, a court <em>cannot</em> – and must not
                    – justify a particular decision based <em>solely</em>
                    on the facts (which, in and of themselves, are purely <em>descriptive</em> in nature and, hence do <em>not</em> contain the <em>normative</em> force
                    required to <em>justify</em> the decision arrived at by the
                    court). Any recourse to the aforesaid mantra would, in substance, be a case of
                    circular argument that seeks to justify decision that is based, in the final
                    analysis, on a purely arbitrary decision on the part of the court. Such an
                    approach must be assiduously avoided, not least because it is the very
                    antithesis of the mission of the law itself (which is to aid the court in
                    arriving at a just and fair decision in accordance with the objective
                    application of the objective (and, of course, relevant) rules and principles of
                    law). Hence, whilst the facts of any given case <em>are</em> of fundamental importance (particularly in the context of
                    the law relating to income tax), they do <em>not</em>
                    operate <em>alone</em>. A decision by the court is the
                    product of an <em>integrated</em> process in which the
                    relevant <em>legal rules and principles</em> are <em>applied</em> to the relevant <em>factual
                        matrix</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       With these preliminary observations in mind, let
                    us now turn to the facts as well as issues in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The taxpayer (“the Appellant”) was
                    incorporated on 11 July 1996 to build and operate a proprietary club
                    (“the Club”). It acquired, for a total consideration of
                    $108,140,542, a 30-year lease of land from the State, commencing on
                    18 October 1996. The Appellant built the Club building on the land at the
                    cost of $91,416,010. In November 1996, the Appellant initiated an introductory
                    launch to invite members of the public to join the club. Each new member paid an
                    entrance fee (payable in 36 monthly instalments) and undertook to pay a
                    monthly subscription fee upon the Club commencing its operations. Membership of
                    the Club entails a licence, for a period commencing from the date the member
                    joins the Club until October 2026, to use and enjoy the facilities of the club.
                    Between 30 November 1996 and 30 November 2000, the Appellant received
                    entrance fees amounting to $526,139,770. The Club began its operations on
                    22 March 2000. The Appellant admitted too many members to the Club and the
                    facilities of the Club were overcrowded. This led a class of members to
                    institute a civil action against the Appellant. In 2005, the Court of Appeal
                    ordered the Appellant to pay damages of $3,000 to each of the members who had
                    participated in the civil action, being diminution in the value of their
                    memberships in the Club arising out of the Appellant’s breach of its
                    obligation to its members to provide a premier club. Subsequently, the Appellant
                    entered into a Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement (“the
                    Scheme”), sanctioned by the High Court, with the rest of the members of
                    the Club to pay $3,000 (partly in kind) to each member. The total amount to be
                    paid to the 17,761 members (including those involved in the civil action)
                    was $53,283,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    Income Tax Board of Review (“the Board”), on 16 June 2009,
                    which dismissed the Appellant’s appeal against the Comptroller of Income
                    Tax’s decision to assess tax, for the Years of Assessment 1998–2003,
                    on the gross entrance fees of $526,139,770 received by the Appellant, without
                    deduction of: (a) the costs of acquiring the land and constructing the Club
                    building thereon amounting to a total of $199,556,552; (b) geomancy fees of
                    $2,338,750 incurred by the Appellant in 2002; and (c) the total sum of
                    $53,283,000 which the Appellant was obliged to pay to its members in 2005,
                    following the civil action referred to above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The issues to be decided in the present appeal
                    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the profit from the entrance
                        fees should be taxed in the year that the fees were levied on each member or
                        whether such profit should be taxed equally over the period of club
                        membership (<em>ie</em>,
                    30 years);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the costs of acquiring the land and constructing the Club building
                        thereon, as well as the geomancy fees, are deductible from the gross
                        entrance fees received; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the sum of $53,283,000, which the Appellant was
                        obliged to pay to the Club’s members following the civil action
                        against it, is deductible in the Year of Assessment
                2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It should also be noted that the Appellant did
                    not pursue the question as to whether the Appellant is entitled to capital
                    allowances pursuant to ss 19 and 19A of the Act and I therefore need say no
                    more about it. Indeed, as counsel for the Appellant, Mr Nand Singh Gandhi,
                    admitted, pursuing this question would have been an uphill task of the steepest
                    order for the Appellant; this is probably (if I may say so) an understatement of
                    sorts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Board</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Board held that the entrance fees accrued
                    as income and were thus taxable under s 10(1) of the Act once each member
                    was admitted to the Club (see <em>ABD v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2009] SGIBTR 3 (“the GD”) at
                    [15]–[17]). The Board referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Pinetree Resort Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2000] 4 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Pinetree</em>”) where the word “accrue” was
                    interpreted (at [23]) to mean “to which any person has become
                    entitled” and observed that, in the present case, the constitution of the
                    Club with respect to fees was similar to that of the club in <em>Pinetree</em>; hence, as a matter of law, the Appellant was legally
                    entitled to the entrance fees once the members were admitted to the
                Club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the issue of the deductibility of the costs
                    of acquiring the land and constructing the building, the Board held (see the GD
                    at [21]) that these were outgoings of a capital nature, incurred once and for
                    all with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the
                    enduring benefit of the trade, and were therefore not deductible for the
                    purposes of ascertaining the income brought to tax. The Board also held that the
                    geomancy fees were a capital expenditure and were therefore not deductible from
                    the income of the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Board held (see the GD at [34]) that, at
                    the inception of the Club, it could not be seriously contended that there was
                    already an accrued liability to the members who had yet to institute civil
                    action against the Appellant. The liability of the Appellant to pay damages to
                    the Club’s members was not absolute and could not be said to have accrued
                    at the very inception of the Club and its quantum ascertained subsequently, in
                    the sense referred to in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Bernhard v Gahan</em> (1928) 13 TC 723
                        (“<em>Bernhard</em>”), a case relied upon
                    by the Appellant. The Board held (see the GD at [37]) that to state that the
                    Appellant’s liability to pay the sums of money to the members had arisen
                    from the inception of the Club would be a significant stretch of logic and
                    contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The date of assessment of the entrance fees</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is a well-established principle of tax law
                    that neither profit nor loss may be anticipated. Income accrues when a taxpayer
                    becomes entitled to it (see also above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>). It is also clear from the Rules and Regulations of the
                    Club (“Rules and Regulations”) that the Appellant has two streams
                    of income from its sale of memberships: (1) the entrance fees and
                    (2) monthly subscription fees, respectively. The issue in the present case
                    is whether the Appellant earned the entrance fees at the time the members were
                    admitted to membership or whether the entrance fees are earned, instead, over
                    the course of 30 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Appellant submits that the profits from
                    the entrance fees received should be taxed over a period of 30 years,
                        <em>ie</em>, the duration of the membership. It is the
                    Appellant’s position that, being contractually bound to deliver and
                    maintain a premier club for the duration of its lease of 30 years, the
                    Appellant earned the entrance fees for the sale of its memberships over the
                    course of the term of the memberships. On the other hand, the Respondent points
                    to the fact that the memberships are transferable and argues that the
                    memberships sold are choses in action. The Respondent submits that the entrance
                    fees are therefore taxable in full in the years in which the members were
                    admitted to membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant provision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 10(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10) – (1) Income tax shall, subject to the
                        provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or rates specified
                        hereinafter for each Year of Assessment upon the income of any person
                            <em>accruing in or derived from</em> Singapore or
                        received in Singapore from outside of Singapore in respect of –</p>

                                been carried on or exercised …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant case law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The case, which constituted the sheet anchor
                    for this part of the Appellant’s case, is the decision of the Singapore
                    Income Tax Board of Review in <em>MPD Pte Ltd v Comptroller of
                        Income Tax</em> (1998) MSTC 5249 (“<em>MPD</em>”), where the salient facts were as follows. The
                    taxpayer in <em>MPD</em> was a company involved in the
                    development of a private residential condominium estate. It sold units of the
                    condominium to purchasers. Under the contracts of sale, the purchasers of the
                    units were required to make progress payments at various stages of construction.
                    Under the Housing Developers (Project Account) Rules 1990 (“the
                    HD(PA)R”), the proceeds of the instalment payments received were paid
                    into a Special Project Account (“SPA”) and any withdrawals had to
                    be made in accordance with the HD(PA)R. The taxpayer kept its books of accounts
                    in accordance with the percentage of completion method. This method matched the
                    costs incurred in reaching a particular stage of completion with progress
                    payments received at that particular point. It was held that the progress
                    payments in the SPA did not constitute income for tax purposes at the material
                    time as they were subject to a number of contingencies before the taxpayer could
                    be said to have earned them. The taxpayer was still under a contractual
                    obligation to complete the development and render title to the developers.
                    Further, the use of the progress payments in the SPA by the taxpayer was
                    severely limited due to statutory restrictions which effectively prevented the
                    taxpayer from appropriating the progress payments. The Board held that as the
                    taxpayer had effectively no control over the progress payments, it could not be
                    said to have earned those payments for income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     
          <em>MPD</em> is clearly
                    distinguishable from the present case. In the present case, the Appellant became
                    legally entitled to the entrance fees once a member was admitted to membership.
                    This is apparent from the fact that, should the Appellant allow a member to pay
                    the entrance fees by monthly instalments, any unpaid balance of the monthly
                    instalments becomes immediately due and payable if a member transfers his
                    membership (see Rule 8.2 of the Rules and Regulations), resigns his
                    membership (see Rule 23 of the Rules and Regulations), or if he is expelled
                    from the Club (see Rule 25.2 of the Rules and Regulations). Moreover, there
                    appears to have been no restriction on the right of the Appellant to deal with
                    the entrance fees as it wished once they were received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellant also refers to the decisions of
                        <em>Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of
                        Taxation</em> (1965) 114 CLR 314 (“<em>Arthur Murray</em>”), <em>Eckel v Board of
                        Inland Revenue</em> [1989] STC 305 (“<em>Eckel</em>”), <em>CIR v Montana Lands
                        Ltd</em> (1968) HKTC 334 (“<em>Montana
                        Lands</em>”) and <em>J P Hall &amp; Co Ltd v Inland Revenue
                        Commissioners</em> [1921] 3 KB 152 (“<em>J P Hall</em>”) to support its case. These
                    cases all hold that income will only be taxed when the taxpayer has earned it.
                    However, the facts of these cases can be distinguished from these in the present
                    proceedings such that it cannot be said that the Appellant in the present
                    proceedings earned the entrance fees over a period of 30 years. Let me
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The High Court of Australia decision of
                        <em>Arthur Murray</em> concerned the taxation of income
                    earned through contracts for the provision of services. In <em>Arthur Murray</em>, it was held that fees received in advance for a
                    course of dancing lessons were not assessable income in the year of receipt.
                    Although there was no contractual right to refunds, the Judge referred (at 319)
                    to the “contingency that the whole or some part of [the fees] may have in
                    effect to be paid back, even if only as damages, should the agreed <em>quid pro quo</em> not be rendered in due course.” The
                    court described (at 318) profits which constitute income as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… amounts which have not only been received but have “come
                        home” to the taxpayer; and that must surely involve, if the word
                        “income” is to convey the notion it expresses in the practical
                        affairs of business life, not only that the amounts received are unaffected
                        by legal restrictions, as by reason of a trust or charge in favour of the
                        payer – not only that they have been received beneficially – but
                        that the situation has been reached in which they may properly be counted as
                        gains completely made, so that there is neither legal nor business
                        unsoundness in regarding them without qualification as income
                        derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the Appellant, relying on that
                    case, argued that the Appellant had not earned the entrance fees in the years it
                    became legally entitled to receive such fees because the Appellant was
                    contractually obliged to provide the members with a premier club for
                    30 years. <em>Arthur Murray</em>, however, can be
                    distinguished from the present case. Whilst <em>Arthur
                        Murray</em> involved the taxation of fees received for a specified
                    number of dancing lessons given over a period of time such that the fees for
                    each dance lesson were not taxed as income until the lesson was actually given,
                    the present case involves the taxation of entrance fees received for the grant
                    of membership to the Club. Once membership is granted, the taxpayer has earned
                    the entrance fees. The monthly subscription fees are separately taxed upon
                    receipt, throughout the period of 30 years, as the income of the Appellant
                    earned through its management of the Club.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The cases of <em>Eckel</em>, <em>Montana Lands</em> and <em>J P Hall</em> concern income earned through
                    contracts for the sale of goods. It is clear from the decisions in those cases,
                    as will be discussed below, that a taxpayer will only be deemed, for tax
                    purposes, to have earned his income when the goods which he has contracted to
                    sell are delivered to the buyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the Privy Council decision (on appeal from
                    the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago) of <em>Eckel</em>, the taxpayer had contracted to sell land in 1970 but was
                    not assessed to tax in respect of any trading profit until 1973 and 1974 when
                    she conveyed the land to the buyer. The Board, having examined the cases of
                        <em>J P Hall</em>, <em>Johnson
                        (Inspector of Taxes v W S Try Ltd</em> (1946)
                    27 TC 167, and <em>IRC v Gardner Mountain and
                        D’Ambrumenil Ltd</em> (1947) 29 TC 69, concluded (at
                    310) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear from these authorities that money will only be treated as
                        being notionally in hand and hence as a trade debt when the trader has done
                        all that is required of him to earn it. Delivery of goods or completion of
                        services to be rendered are examples of events which may give rise to
                        taxation in a fiscal year in which they occur, albeit payment is not made
                        until a subsequent year. In the present case, their Lordships have no doubt
                        that a stage comparable neither to delivery of goods nor to completion of
                        services had been reached on 26 September 1970.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Board held that the fact that the taxpayer had no legal title to
                    the land and could not convey it in 1970, combined with the fact that her right
                    to receive payment of the purchase price was contingent on the company
                    requesting her to execute a prior conveyance, indicated that she had not done
                    all that was required of her to reap the profit of her venture when she executed
                    the contract in 1970.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the Supreme Court of Hong Kong decision of
                        <em>Montana Lands</em>, the taxpayer carried on the
                    trade of constructing and selling flats on an instalment basis. Completion did
                    not take place until the final instalment was paid although the purchaser was
                    allowed to occupy the flat before completion. The taxpayer was assessed to tax
                    on unpaid instalments. The court held that the unpaid instalments were not
                    taxable as the profit on the transaction was merely in the course of realisation
                    until actual completion. The court noted (at 188–189) that the purchaser
                    of a flat does not contract for mere possession or occupation but “for a
                    title, in the form of a registrable deed of assignment of the property agreed to
                    be bought and sold”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>J P Hall</em>, the company entered into a
                    contract to supply motor and motor gears over a period of time. The Court of
                    Appeal held that the profits were taxable as and when the goods were delivered,
                    and not when the contract was entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     From a review of the above cases, it appears
                    that the stage at which a taxpayer will be deemed to have done all that is
                    required of it to earn the income depends on the particular trade it is engaged
                    in. Where it has contracted to sell property (as in <em>MPD</em>, <em>Eckel</em> and <em>Montana Lands</em>), the taxpayer will have earned the income when:
                    it is able to convey the property (<em>Eckel</em>); the
                    purchaser of the property gets what he has contracted to buy from the taxpayer
                        (<em>Montana Lands</em>); and the taxpayer has control
                    over the purchase moneys received (<em>MPD</em>). Where the
                    taxpayer has contracted to perform services, it will have earned the income when
                    it has performed the service (<em>Arthur Murray</em>). When
                    the taxpayer has contracted to supply goods, it will have earned the income when
                    he supplies the goods (<em>J P Hall</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The time of accrual of the entrance fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the present case, the obligation of the
                    Appellant, upon receipt of the entrance fees, was merely to admit the payer of
                    the entrance fees to membership. The Appellant fulfilled this obligation when
                    the liability of the member to pay the entrance fees accrued. The entrance fees
                    paid to the Appellant can fairly be said to have “come home” to
                    the Appellant upon the grant of membership since the Appellant was legally
                    entitled to the whole of the entrance fees once the application for membership
                    was approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Respondent relied on the decision in
                        <em>Pinetree</em> to support its argument that entrance
                    fees are taxable in full at the time the taxpayer receives them. In <em>Pinetree</em>, the Court of Appeal (at [23]), when
                    considering what was labelled as an “initiation deposit” paid by a
                    member of Pinetree Club upon being admitted to membership, interpreted the word
                    “accrue” in s 10(1) of the Act to mean “to which any
                    person has become entitled” (see also above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>). Although the issue in <em>Pinetree</em> was whether the initiation deposit was a loan or income
                    rather than whether the initiation deposit could be regarded as income at the
                    time of receipt, the court did consider the taxpayers’ argument that the
                    initiation deposits should not be regarded as having accrued to the taxpayer as
                    they were subject to legal impediments. The taxpayers in <em>Pinetree</em> cited the case of <em>Arthur
                        Murray</em> in support of this proposition. The court observed (at
                    [43]) that, in the court below, Tan Lee Meng J had distinguished <em>Arthur Murray</em> from <em>Pinetree</em> on the grounds that <em>Arthur
                        Murray</em> concerned advance payments, which was unlike the
                    circumstances in <em>Pinetree</em>. The court proceeded to
                    observe as follows (at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, even where payments are subject to legal impediments, the
                        cases show that this factor is not conclusive of whether the payments could
                        be regarded as income. The courts clearly take into account other factors,
                        in particular, how the taxpaying companies deal with the moneys, in deciding
                        the matter. <em>Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT</em>
                        was thus not very helpful to the appellants’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court dismissed (at [45]) the appellants’ claim that they
                    had not “received” the moneys in a true sense of the word as the
                    members were free to reclaim the initiation deposits on the ground that the
                    appellants in <em>Pinetree</em> had been at liberty to use
                    the moneys representing the initiation deposits as they pleased. It is clear
                    from the reasoning of the court that the fact that the initiation deposits may
                    have been forfeited at a later date did not prevent them from constituting
                    income at the time of receipt. Similarly, in the present case, the fact that the
                    Appellant might be liable to its members in an action for breach of contract if
                    the Appellant fails to provide them with the use of a premier club for a
                    duration of 30 years should not prevent the entrance fees (received in
                    consideration for the grant of membership to the Club) from constituting income
                    of the Appellant at the time of receipt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     By way of a coda, it might be noted that the
                    views of learned scholars add further support to the conclusion that an entrance
                    fee comprises only the consideration for the ability to join a club and should
                    be taxable at the time it is incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Ashton and Reid have commented as follows (see
                        <em>Ashton and Reid on Club Law</em> (David Ashton and
                    Paul Reid, Jordan Publishing Limited, 2005) (“<em>Ashton
                        and Reid</em>”) at para 4-38):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Problems are sometimes encountered where the club has been dissolved and
                        recently joined members have complained that they are entitled to a refund
                        in whole or in part of the entrance fee in addition to the unexpired portion
                        of the subscription. We consider that no part of this fee is refundable as
                        it comprised the consideration for the ability to join the club in the first
                        place and is in no wise carried forward into the period of
                        membership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although <em>Ashton and Reid</em> recognised, by
                    reference to the decision of Lawrence J in the English High Court decision
                    of <em>Re Curzon Syndicate Ltd</em> [1920] LT
                    Jo 232, that the point may not be free from doubt, they sought to
                    distinguish this decision on its facts. In <em>Re Curzon
                        Syndicate Ltd</em>, one of the plaintiffs successfully claimed back
                    her entrance fee in the liquidation when the proprietary club closed down. The
                    learned authors comment that special circumstances may have applied in the said
                    case. In particular, they observed as follows (at para 4-38):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 1917, Mrs H, who was the governing director of the company which
                        owned the club and who was personally the lessor of the club premises,
                        posted in the clubhouse a notice, in reply to a rumour that the club was
                        going to close down, stating that the club would be carried on permanently.
                        On 25 March 1919, Mrs H obtained judgment against the company for
                        arrears of rent and on the same day closed the club, with the notice still
                        being in place. The law report does not indicate the date when the plaintiff
                        paid her entrance fee or the date when she became a member, nor the basis of
                        recovery of the entrance fee. The judge may have come to the conclusion that
                        with the notice still in place for all to see, there was an implied term in
                        the contract of membership that the club would not shut down save on
                        reasonable notice. That being so, the company was in breach of the implied
                        term by instant closure, and accordingly the entrance fee was recoverable as
                        an item of wasted expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     J F Josling and Lionel Alexander, in
                        <em>Law of Clubs</em> (Longman, 6th Ed, 1987)
                    referred (at p 34) to the decision of Hawkins J in <em>Re Duty on the Estate of the New University Club</em> (1887)
                    18 QBD 720 where the nature of members’ subscriptions and entry
                    fees to a members’ club was considered. Hawkins J stated (at 727)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not prepared to say that the entrance fee and first year’s
                        subscription could be sued for at all, for an elected member has an option
                        to accept or refuse the membership offered him; but once fully admitted as a
                        member, I see no reason why he should not be bound to fulfil all the
                        obligations imposed upon him by the rules, to which he has given his
                        submission as part of the consideration for the benefits he has acquired a
                        right, so long as he continues a member, to enjoy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Josling and Alexander</em> comment (at
                    pp 34–35) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be deduced from his lordship’s conclusions that the
                        application for membership is simply a preliminary step. The offer is the
                        election, and the proposed member has an option to accept or refuse it. The
                        acceptance which completes the contract is the payment of the entry fee and
                        first subscription in accordance with the offer. Thus Hawkins J thought
                        that the entrance fee and first subscription could probably not, in ordinary
                        cases, be sued for. Later subscriptions – when full membership has
                        begun – can be sued for …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present case, the entrance fees were
                    paid in exchange for admittance into membership of the Club. Although it is a
                    term of the contract for the grant of membership that the membership would last
                    for 30 years, this merely affects the characteristic of the membership
                    granted. Just like those of the proprietary club taxpayer in <em>HU v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> [1999] SGITBR 1, the
                    memberships of the Club in the present case are transferable (see Rules 8.1
                    and 9.1 of the Rules and Regulations). In <em>HU v
                    CIT</em>, the Income Tax Board of Review held (at [65]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[We] are of the view that club membership is more than a mere personal
                        right to use the club facilities subject to club regulations. We agree with
                        the Respondent that club membership is a chose in action or some other form
                        of intangible property. We agree that membership in the Club must be more
                        than a mere personal right, if only because it is transferable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I accept the Respondent’s submission that a membership of the
                    Club is a chose in action (although it does not confer any rights on the members
                    to the assets of the Club as such (see the analysis below at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>–<a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>)). This chose in action was granted to the members on the
                    date that liability to pay the entrance fees accrued. As such, the Appellant
                    earned the full amount of the entrance fees at that particular point in
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Appellant argues that if it is found, as
                    the Respondent submits, that the entrance fees accrued as income once the
                    members were admitted to membership, it must follow that the entire entrance
                    fees received by the Appellant was income of a certain Year of Assessment (1998)
                    and not income of the other years of assessment under appeal (<em>ie</em>, 1999–2003) whenever the instalment payments of the
                    entrance fees were received. The Respondent contends that this is a
                    concessionary tax treatment that was eventually granted to the Appellant. I find
                    that the Respondent is entitled to allow this concessionary tax treatment and
                    this should not detract from the Respondent’s legal right to tax the
                    income once it accrues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The deductibility of the expenses incurred</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We turn now to consider the issue as to
                    whether or not the cost of acquiring the land and of constructing the building
                    constitute either capital or revenue expenditure. If it is the former, then the
                    expenditure would fall within the ambit of s 15(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act and, hence, <em>not</em>
                    amount to a deductible expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, although this issue may appear to be
                    a simple one, nothing could be further from the truth. As I observed in the
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v
                        IA</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 161 (at [1]-[2]
                    and [65]-[66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    It is a notorious and unfortunate fact that the
                            distinction (in tax law) between the concept of capital on the one hand
                            and that of revenue on the other is often elusive and even illusory.
                            Even on the most promising of occasions, there are tremendous
                            difficulties of application. This case is, unfortunately, no
                            exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    Indeed, it has often been stated that the
                            difficulties referred to in the preceding paragraph arise precisely
                            because it is all an issue of application. In other words, everything
                            depends on the facts. This is true to some extent but it is, in our
                            view, too facile a position to take without more (see also
                            [65]–[66] below). The law must surely embody guiding principles
                            that are both its lifeblood and hence its essence. The difficulty in
                            discovering and/or stating these principles is no excuse for abandoning
                            the search for them. The law is not – and cannot be – a mere
                            agglomeration of disparate facts lost in the legal desert. To this end,
                            we attempt, in the present proceedings, to both search for as well as
                            state the relevant legal principles that are rooted in both logic as
                            well as justice and fairness.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    … [T]he
                            distinction between capital and revenue has often been described as
                            being a factual inquiry. However, it will not do, in our view, to simply
                            leave it at that. It is an abdication of judicial responsibility to
                            merely state that “it all depends on the facts” when it is
                            possible to furnish some further (if only rough) guidelines. As Choo Han
                            Teck J put it in the Singapore High Court decision of Ngee Ann
                            Development Pte Ltd v Nova Leisure Pte Ltd [2003] SGHC 168 at
                            [6]–[7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In construing a contractual document the only immutable principle is
                            that the court should extract such meaning from the words that the
                            parties had chosen to reflect their intention at the time of the
                            contract. It is wrong to give to the words a meaning that counsel thinks
                            the words ought to mean, or even what the court thinks they ought to
                            mean. Semantic interpretation is very often a very difficult exercise.
                            What the words say and what the parties mean by the words they say may
                            not be the same thing. ... One great fundamental in the application of
                            the law is consistency because consistency is the alloy of
                            predictability. In this regard, the courts ought to consistently adopt
                            the approach that the meaning to be given to written words must first be
                            that as appears from the text. The context becomes an aide in
                            interpretation only if the words are vague or ambiguous, and only to the
                            extent that a reasonable application of the context would easily bring
                            out the meaning intended by both sides.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">For the above reason the phrase ‘it all depends on the facts of
                            the case’ can so easily become the anthem of inconsistency. The
                            phrase has such a magical ring to it. It seems that whenever this
                            incantation is made the court is at liberty to do as it pleases –
                            because ‘there is no case like the present’. That is the
                            temptation we must all resist. …</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    Although the words italicised in the above
                            quotation were espoused in a slightly different context, the general
                            principle contained therein is germane to the point we have made in the
                            preceding paragraph. In the circumstances, we proceed to attempt to
                            furnish a couple of rough guidelines that are not only of assistance to
                            the present court but which may also be of some assistance to courts in
                            future cases relating to a similar type of transaction and/or set of
                            facts. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The observations just quoted emphasise a point
                    made in the Introduction to this judgment (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>) – that whilst the particular factual matrix in the
                    case is of special importance in the context of income tax, one cannot (and must
                    not) rely merely on the trite mantra that “It all depends on the
                    facts”. The applicable <em>legal rules and
                        principles</em> (which possess the requisite <em>normative</em> force that <em>justifies</em> the
                    decision arrived at by the court) <em>must</em> be
                        <em>applied</em> to <em>the
                        facts</em> at hand. That having been said, the applicable legal rules
                    and principles are – unfortunately – not a model of precision, to
                    say the least. Indeed, the courts have – over many years – mooted
                        <em>several</em> tests which are supposed to aid the
                    court in ascertaining whether or not a specific item (or items) of expenditure
                    are either capital or revenue in nature. However, there is no clear guidance as
                    to <em>which</em> test ought to prevail; indeed, as we
                    shall see, some tests also appear to <em>overlap</em> with
                    each other. Further, the very <em>application</em> of these
                    principles in the <em>actual cases</em> themselves
                    demonstrates that the tests concerned do not – except in the clearest fact
                    situations – yield close to determinate results; more specifically, the
                    presence of <em>dissenting judgments</em> is a clear
                    indication in this particular regard. All this generates, with respect, more
                    legal heat than light. Hence, it is important to review the various tests
                    postulated before applying one of them (or a combination thereof) to the facts
                    of the present appeal. However, before proceeding to do so, it would be apposite
                    to set out the relevant provisions of the Act itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section 14 of the Act provides for
                    deductions against income. The provision itself comprises, in fact, a number of
                    categories of deductions (<em>viz</em>, general, specific,
                    special as well as further deductions, respectively; see also generally
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
                    paras 205.089–205.092). For the purposes of the present appeal, the
                    relevant provision relates to general deductions under s 14(1), the
                    material part of which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14. – (1) For the purposes of ascertaining the income of any
                        person for any period from any source chargeable with tax under this Act
                        (referred to in this Part as income), there shall be deducted all outgoings
                        and expenses wholly and exclusively incurred during that period by that
                        person in the production of the income …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     
          <em>However</em>,
                    s 15 of the Act lists the types of deductions which are <em>not</em> allowed (see also <em>Halsbury’s Laws
                        of Singapore</em> at para 205.089). In particular,
                        s 15(1)(<em>c</em>) (referred to above at
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>) is of crucial relevance in the
                    present appeal, and reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15. – (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this
                        Act, for the purposes of ascertaining the income of any person, no deduction
                        shall be allowed in respect of –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>c</em>) any capital withdrawn or any
                            sum employed or intended to be employed as capital except as provided in
                                section 14(1)(<em>h</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 14(1)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    Act allows for the deduction of capital expenditure:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>h</em>)  where the income is derived
                        from the working of a mine or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting
                        nature, such deductions in respect of capital expenditure as may be
                        prescribed in rules made under section 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the Act clearly prohibits the deduction of capital
                    expenditure except where s 14(1)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    Act applies or where the deduction of such expenditure is specifically provided
                    for in the Act (see, in particular, s 14A–Q of the Act). In this
                    regard, and as a matter of general principle, the following observations by
                    Sir Wilfrid Greene MR in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Commissioners of Inland Revenue v British Salmson Aero
                        Engines, Limited</em> [1938] 2 KB 482 (“<em>British Salmson Aero Engines</em>”) (at 498) might be
                    usefully noted (see also the reference to the <em>Heasman
                        Report</em> above (at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Income tax, as has been said over and over again, is a tax on income. It
                        does not tax capital. As the corollary to that, in ascertaining profits,
                        payments of a capital nature may not be deducted. It is income all the time
                        which has to be considered under the Income Tax Acts …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Hence, in so far as the present proceedings
                    are concerned, in order for the Appellant to be able to deduct the costs of
                    acquiring the lease and constructing the Club for tax purposes, such expenditure
                    cannot be of a capital nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This is an appropriate juncture to consider
                    the various tests which are supposed to aid the court in ascertaining whether or
                    not a specific item (or specific items) of expenditure are either capital or
                    revenue in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The tests considered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As already mentioned, there are a number of
                    tests on offer, so to speak (and for general overviews, see, for example,
                        <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
                    paras 205.095–205.096; Pok Soy Yoong &amp; Damian Hong Chin Fock,

                        Law</em> at pp 444–446).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The “once and for all” test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     At this juncture, it should be noted that
                    there was, <em>first</em>, an early test (popularly
                    referred to as the “once and for all” test, which is contained in
                    the observations of Lord Dunedin in the Scottish Court of Session (First
                    Division) decision of <em>Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v
                        Farmer</em> (1910) 5 TC 529 (“<em>Vallambrosa</em>”), where it was observed (at 536) that
                    “capital expenditure is a thing that is going to be spent once for all,
                    and income expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year”.
                    However, this is a very broad test and is (as we shall see) subsumed within a
                    more comprehensive test (which is considered next). Indeed, Lord Dunedin
                    himself sounded a note of caution on this particular test by way of the
                    following prefatory remark, as follows (at 536):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now, I don’t say that this consideration is absolutely final or
                        determinative, but in a rough way I think it is not a bad criterion of what
                        is capital expenditure as against what is income expenditure …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">More importantly, in a case which embodies the next – and more
                    comprehensive – test, <em>viz</em>, the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>British Insulated and Helsby Cables,
                        Limited v Atherton</em> [1926] AC 205 (“<em>Atherton</em>”), Viscount Cave LC expressed the
                    view (at 213) that the test enunciated by Lord Dunedin in <em>Vallambrosa</em> “is not, and was obviously not
                    intended by Lord Dunedin to be, a decisive one in every case; for it is
                    easy to imagine many cases in which a payment, though made “once and for
                    all”, would be properly chargeable against the receipts for the
                    year”. The learned law lord then proceeded to observe thus (at
                    213):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Instances of such payments may be found in the gratuity of 1500l. paid to
                        a reporter on his retirement, which was the subject of the decision in
                            <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Incorporated
                            Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales<sup></sup></em>[[1914] 3 KB 674], and in the
                        expenditure of 4994l. in the purchase of an annuity for the benefit of an
                        actuary who had retired, which, in <em>Hancock</em> v.
                            <em>General Reversionary and Investment
                        Co</em>.[[1919] 1 KB 25], was allowed, and I think rightly
                        allowed, to be deducted from profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Most importantly, Viscount Cave LC then proceeded to enunciate
                    what constitutes the <em>next</em> test – to which
                    our attention must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The “enduring benefit of the trade”
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The <em>second</em>
                    – and, arguably, most well-known as well as well-cited – test is to
                    be found in the judgment of Viscount Cave LC in <em>Atherton</em>. In that decision, the learned law lord observed thus
                    (at 213-214):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But when an expenditure is made, <b><em>not only</em></b><em>once and for all</em>, but <em>with
                            a view to bringing into existence and asset or an advantage</em><b><em>for the enduring benefit of a trade</em></b>, I think
                        that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances
                        leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as
                        properly attributable not to revenue but to <em>capital</em>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is interesting to note that the actual
                    decision in <em>Atherton</em> itself was <em>not</em> a unanimous one (the House holding that the relevant
                    expenditure was capital in nature by a bare majority of three to two). In this
                    case, the appellant taxpayer (who was a manufacturer of insulated cables) had a
                    substantial complement of clerical and technical staff. In order to enhance its
                    business and stem the loss of experienced staff, it established a pension fund
                    for its clerical and technical staff. A sum was paid by the appellant into this
                    fund and the issue was whether or not such payment was an admissible deduction
                    in computing its profits for the purpose of assessment to income tax in that
                    particular financial year. The majority (comprising Viscount Cave LC,
                    Lord Atkinson and Lord Buckmaster) held that the payment was in the
                    nature of capital expenditure and was thus not an admissible deduction.
                    Lord Carson and Lord Blanesburgh disagreed. In particular, Viscount
                    Cave LC was of the view that, without the said payment, the pension fund
                    might not have come into existence at all. The learned law lord concluded (at
                    214) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The object and effect of the payment of this large sum was to enable the
                        company to establish a pension fund and to offer to all its existing and
                        future employees a sure provision for their old age, and so to obtain for
                        the company the substantial and lasting advantage of being in a position
                        throughout its business life to secure and retain the services of a
                        contented and efficient staff. I am satisfied on full consideration that the
                        payment was in the nature of capital expenditure …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, Lord Carson expressed a different view altogether; the
                    learned law lord opined thus (at 225 and 226):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear form the terms of the trust deed [establishing the pension
                        fund] … that in no sense was the sum an investment, that it would be
                        eventually exhausted in payment of the pensions, and that in the event of a
                        winding up of the company it could never form any part of the assets of the
                        company. I cannot, under these circumstances, conceive any system of
                        commercial accountancy under which this sum could ever appear in the capital
                        accounts of the company. Nor is it capital withdrawn from the business, as
                        it was admittedly paid out of the earnings of the year. … I can find
                        no reason for holding that a payment paid to make up the contribution to a
                        sufficient sum to enable the older servants of the company to enjoy the
                        benefits of the pension fund brings into existence an asset or an advantage
                        for the enduring benefit of trade and might therefore be attributed not to
                        revenue but to capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And Lord Blanesburgh was of the view, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the payment concerned was similar to an increased
                    remuneration to the employees concerned. The difference in result is, at bottom,
                    a difference in the <em>characterisation</em> of the facts.
                    The majority of the House in this case viewed the payment concerned as
                    strengthening the core structure and business of the company, so to speak, and
                    was (looked at in that light) a capital expenditure, whereas the minority was of
                    the view that the payment concerned was merely a revenue expense in relation to
                    the payment of salaries. It cannot, in my view, be said that one view is
                        <em>clearly and definitively</em> superior to the
                    other, although the majority view is helpful in so far as it accords some
                    flexibility to the manner in which a particular expenditure is analysed as being
                    capital (as opposed to being revenue) in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Further, although <em>Atherton</em> is considered a leading decision, it is by no means a
                    panacea. Not surprisingly, therefore, Lord Macmillan proffered the
                    following cautionary remarks in the House of Lords decision in <em>Van den Berghs, Limited v Clark (Inspector of Taxes)</em>
                    [1935] AC 431 (“<em>Van den
                    Berghs</em>”) (at 439):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This case [<em>Atherton</em>] has been generally
                        recognized as the leading modern authority on the subject, though I fear
                        that Romer L.J. was unduly optimistic when he said that it
                        “placed beyond the realms of controversy” the law applicable
                        to the matter: <em>Anglo-Persian Oil Co</em>. v.
                            <em>Dale</em> [[1932] 1 KB 124 at
                        145].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Indeed, that part of Viscount
                    Cave LC’s judgment referring to the requirement of an
                    “enduring benefit” (which is the key addition to the “once
                    and for all” test enunciated in <em>Vallambrosa</em>) gives rise to particular difficulties as many types of
                    expenditure may have an enduring effect but nevertheless not be of a capital
                    nature (see, for example, <em>per</em> Lord Reid in
                    the House of Lords decision of <em>Commissioner of Inland Revenue
                        v Carron Company</em> (1968) 45 TC 18, where the learned law
                    lord observed (at 68) that “money spent on income account, for example on
                    durable repairs, may often yield an enduring advantage” and that
                    “[i]n a case of this kind what matters is the nature of the advantage for
                    which the money was spent”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The “fixed and circulating capital”
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The <em>third</em> test
                    centres on the distinction between <em>fixed and circulating
                        capital</em>. As Prof Tiley helpfully observes (<em>Revenue Law</em> at p 445):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Expenditure on the fixed capital of a business is capital expenditure, not
                        revenue. Fixed capital is retained in the shape of assets which either
                        produce income without further action, eg shares held by an investment
                        company, or are made use of to produce income, eg machinery in a factory.
                        Circulating capital is that which the company intends should be used by
                        being temporarily parted with and circulated in the business only to return
                        with, it is hoped, profit, eg money spent on trading stock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     However, as the learned author then proceeded
                    to – both pithily as well as perceptively – observe (<em>Revenue Law</em> at p 445):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The difficulty with this test is that it sometimes begs the very question
                        at issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I would tend to agree with the view just
                    expressed (see also <em>Singapore Taxation</em> at
                    p 90 (where the test is stated by the learned authors to be “of
                    limited usefulness only”) as well as <em>Whiteman</em> at para 6-09 (where the learned authors observe
                    that “[t]his distinction however has its own problems, as it is not
                    possible to draw an exact line of demarcation between fixed and circulating
                    capital)). The distinction between fixed and circulating capital does not, with
                    respect, represent an advance – in <em>substance</em>
                    at least – over the test in <em>Atherton</em> and may
                    even be said, in some cases at least, to (as Prof Tiley has observed)
                    assume the very thing (<em>viz</em>, the distinction
                    between capital and revenue) that has to be proved. Indeed, in <em>Van den Berghs</em>, Lord Macmillan observed thus (at
                    443):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have not overlooked the criterion afforded by the economists’
                        differentiation between fixed and circulating capital which
                        Lord Haldane invoked in <em>John Smith &amp;
                            Son</em> v. <em>Moore</em> [[1921]
                        2 AC 13] and on which the Court of Appeal relied in the present
                        case, <em>but I confess that I have not found it very
                            helpful. Circulating</em> capital is capital which is turned over
                        and in the process of being turned over yields profit or loss. <em>Fixed</em> capital is not involved directly in that
                        process, and remains unaffected by it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This unfortunate result is, perhaps, not
                    surprising. Absent the elaboration that is to be found in cases such as
                        <em>Atherton</em>, there appears to be no real guidance
                    in this particular test. Indeed, it is suggested that the <em>application</em> of the test might – on occasion at least
                    – compound the problem, especially if the fact situation is a borderline
                    or marginal one. That having been said, there is nevertheless case law which has
                    applied this test, the seminal decision being that of the House of Lords in
                        <em>John Smith and Son v Moore</em> [1921]
                    2 AC 13. In that case, Viscount Haldane observed thus (at
                    19–20):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, it is not necessary to draw an exact line of demarcation between
                        fixed and circulating capital. Since Adam Smith drew the distinction in the
                        Second Book of his Wealth of Nations, which appears in the chapter on the
                        Division of Stock, a distinction which has since become classical,
                        economists have never been able to define much more precisely what the line
                        of demarcation is. Adam Smith described fixed capital as what the owner
                        turns to profit by keeping it in his own possession, circulating capital as
                        what he makes profit of by parting with it and letting it change masters.
                        The latter capital circulates in this sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The test was also applied in the Australian
                    Privy Council decision of <em>BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of
                        Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia</em> [1966]
                    1 AC 224 (“<em>BP Australia</em>”),
                    where Lord Pearce, delivering the judgment of the court, observed thus (at
                    265–266):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fixed capital is prima facie that on which you look to get a return by
                        your trading operations. Circulating capital is that which comes back in
                        your trading operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may also be made to <em>Atherton</em>
                    (at 234 and 236); the Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Rhodesian Court
                    of Appeal) of <em>British South Africa Company v Commissioner of
                        Income Tax</em> [1946] AC 62 (“<em>British South Africa</em>”) at 80; and the Privy Council
                    decision (on appeal from the Federal Supreme Court of the Federation of Rhodesia
                    and Nyasaland) of <em>Commissioner of Taxes v Nchanga
                        Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd</em> [1964] AC 948
                        (“<em>Nchanga</em>”) at
                960.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Interestingly, though, Rowlatt J did, in
                    the English High Court decision of <em>Anglo-Persian Oil Company,
                        Limited v Dale (HM Inspector of Taxes)</em> (1931) 16 TC 253
                    (affirmed by the Court of Appeal and reported in the same citation as well at
                    [1932] 1 KB 124), when referring to the “enduring benefit of
                    the trade” test embodied within the judgment of Viscount Cave LC in
                        <em>Atherton</em> (above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>), observe (at 262) that “[w]hat Lord Cave is
                    quite clearly speaking of is a benefit which endures, in the way that <em>fixed capital</em> endures; not a benefit that endures in the
                    sense that for a good number of years it relieves you of a revenue
                    payment” [emphasis added]. Although the learned judge did not expressly
                    equate the “enduring benefit of the trade” test with the present
                    test (which draws a distinction between fixed and circulating capital), it is
                    suggested that there is clearly an overlap and, having regard to the analysis I
                    have proffered above, perhaps even a <em>complete</em>
                    overlap (<em>viz</em>, <em>equivalence</em>) between both tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The “identifiable asset” test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The <em>fourth</em> test
                    is the “identifiable asset” test, which was described by
                    Lord Wilberforce in the leading House of Lords decision of <em>Tucker (Inspector of Taxes) v Granada Motorway Services
                        Ltd</em> [1979] 1 WLR 683 (“<em>Tucker</em>”) as follows (at 686):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that the key to the present case is to be found in those cases
                        which have sought <em>to identify an asset. In them it seems
                            reasonably logical to start with the assumption that money spent on the
                            acquisition of the asset should be regarded as capital
                            expenditure</em>. Extensions from this are, first, to regard money
                        spent on getting rid of a disadvantageous asset as capital expenditure and,
                        secondly, to regard money spent on improving the asset, or making it more
                        advantageous, as capital expenditure. In the latter type of case it will
                        have to be considered whether the expenditure has the result stated or
                        whether it should be regarded as expenditure on maintenance or upkeep, and
                        some cases may pose difficult problems. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     However, this particular test may not be as
                    useful as it appears at first blush – save for the assumption that money
                    spent on the acquisition of an asset should be regarded (in the first instance
                    at least) as capital expenditure. However, even this assumption does not do away
                    with the need for the court concerned to scrutinise the relevant factual matrix
                    closely in any event. Further, this particular test appears simply to be another
                    way of expressing the “enduring benefit of the trade” test in
                        <em>Atherton</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>) inasmuch as Lord Wilberforce proceeds,
                    in <em>Tucker</em>, immediately to refer to the proposition
                    laid down by Viscount Cave LC in <em>Atherton</em>
                    (see at 686). Finally, the learned law lord himself, whilst arguing that the
                    test should be maintained, nevertheless introduced the following qualification
                    (at 687):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [“identifiable asset”] test may be to some extent
                        arbitrary, but it provides a means which the courts can understand for
                        distinguishing capital and income expenditure and I think that we would be
                        wise to maintain it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As an interesting coda of sorts, it should be noted that
                    Lord Salmon dissented on the facts of <em>Tucker</em>
                    itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   What is the present position?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(a)   Commonsense and Uncertainty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     What are we to make of the various tests?
                    Unfortunately, the legal prognosis – as demonstrated in the case law
                    – is far from “healthy”. For example, that very experienced
                    tax judge, Rowlatt J, observed, in the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Countess Warwick Steamship Company, Limited v Ogg
                        (Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1924] 2 KB 292 at 298, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is very difficult, as I have observed in previous cases of this kind,
                        following the highest authority, to lay down any general rule which is both
                        sufficiently accurate and sufficiently exhaustive to cover all or even a
                        great number of the possible cases, and I shall not attempt to lay down any
                        such rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     And, not many years later, Sir Wilfrid
                    Greene MR observed, in <em>British Salmson Aero
                        Engines</em>, thus (at 498):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were in 1925, and there have been since, many cases where this
                        matter of capital or income has been debated. T<em>here have
                            been many cases which fall on the border-line. Indeed, in many cases it
                            is almost true to say that the spin of a coin would decide the matter
                            almost as satisfactorily as an attempt to find reasons. But that class
                            of question is a notorious one, and has been so for many
                            years</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     This somewhat nebulous position has –
                    unfortunately – not improved with the passage of time. In <em>BP Australia</em>, for example, Lord Pearce observed
                    thus (at 264–265):</p>

<p class="Judg-1">It may be worthy to note that another decision (of the House of Lords)
                    was also handed down the same day as the decision in <em>BP
                        Australia</em>, <em>viz</em>, <em>Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick (HM Inspector of Taxes)</em>
                    [1966] AC 295 (“<em>Strick</em>”).
                    They were – in Brightman J’s words in the English High Court
                    decision of <em>ECC Quarries Ltd v Watkis (HM Inspector of
                        Taxes)</em> [1977] 1 WLR 1386 (at 1396) –
                    “comparable cases of petrol station ties”. However, the actual
                    results arrived at in both decisions were quite different inasmuch as the court
                    in <em>BP Australia</em> held that the expenditure
                    concerned was revenue in nature, whereas the court in <em>Strick</em> held that the expenditure in that particular case was
                    capital in nature (see also <em>Whiteman</em> at
                    paras 7-07-7-09). Indeed, as we have seen, there can be differing views
                    even <em>within</em> the same case (see, for example, the
                    decision in <em>Atherton</em>, referred to above (at
                        <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>)). It is true that one can explain
                    such differences in result by referring to the different <em>fact
                        situations</em>. <em>However</em>, the dangers of
                        <em>unnecessary</em> uncertainty can, it is suggested,
                    be at least reduced if more specific legal rules and principles are formulated
                    – as opposed to relying merely on commonsense. In fairness,
                    Lord Pearce may be said (in <em>BP Australia</em>) to
                    have been concerned more with the use of commonsense in the <em>application</em> of the legal rules and principles to the facts of
                    the case rather than relying on commonsense <em>per se</em>
                    as the guiding normative principle. Indeed, in <em>Strick</em> itself, Lord Reid also observed thus (at
                    313):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is not surprising that no one test or principle or rule of thumb is
                        paramount. The question is ultimately a question of law for the Court,
                            <em>but it is a question which must be answered in light
                            of all the circumstances which it is reasonable to take into
                            account</em>, and the weight which must be given to a particular
                        circumstance in a particular case must depend rather on common sense than on
                        a strict application of any single legal principle. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     And, in <em>Tucker</em>,
                    Lord Wilberforce was (at 686) of the view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is common in cases which raise the question whether a payment is to be

                        ways. <em>In the end the courts can do little better than
                            form an opinion which way the balance lies</em>. There are a
                        number of tests which have been stated in reported cases which it is useful
                        to apply, but we have been warned more than once not to seek automatically
                        to apply to one case words or formulae which have been found useful in
                        another … Nevertheless reported cases are the best tools that we
                        have, even if they may sometimes be blunt instruments. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Turning to an even more recent decision, that
                    of the English High Court in <em>Vodafone Cellular Ltd v Shaw (HM
                        Inspector of Taxes)</em> (1997) 69 TC 376, the overall
                    situation appears to be the same. In that case, Jacob J (citing
                    observations made by Lord Reid in <em>Strick</em> and
                    by Lord Wilberforce in <em>Tucker</em> (see also above
                    at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a> and <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>, respectively)) observed (at 425) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>One of the troubles with all the tests propounded by
                            the courts is that they are necessarily imprecise</em>. Given that
                        any expenditure has to be put in a box labelled “revenue” or
                        “capital” there is an obvious difficulty in forcing many kinds
                        of expenditure having some of the characteristics of both into one box or
                        the other. Counsel on both sides used the expression “capital
                        feel” or “revenue feel” about items under discussion.
                            <em>Even though it is a question of law, there is a
                            measure of gut reaction about the decision</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And, at the Court of Appeal stage (reported under the same citation),
                    Millett LJ observed thus (at 433):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>There is no single test or infallible criterion for
                            distinguishing between capital and revenue payments</em> …
                        On the contrary, there are <em>many factors which tend in one
                            direction or the other, some of which are more relevant in some
                            situations and some in others</em>. Some factors are particularly
                        relevant when the question arises on an acquisition and others are of
                        particular relevance when the question arises on a disposal, as it does in
                        the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Two matters are of particular importance: the nature of
                            the payment; and the nature of the advantage obtained by the
                            payment</em>. The fact that the payment is a lump sum payment is
                        relevant but not determinative. In a case such as the present, where the
                        payment is made in order to get rid of a liability, a useful starting point
                        is to inquire into the nature of the liability which is brought to an end by
                        the payment. Where a lump sum payment is made in order to commute or
                        extinguish a contractual obligation to make recurring revenue payments then
                        the payment is <em>prima facie</em> a revenue
                        payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">All this is reminiscent of Lord Denning MR’s own
                    observations in the earlier English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Heather (HM Inspector of Taxes) v P-E Consulting Group
                        Ltd</em> [1973] Ch 189 (“<em>Heather</em>”), where the learned Master of the Rolls observed
                    thus (at 216):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question—revenue expenditure or capital expenditure—is a
                        question which is being repeatedly asked by men of business, by accountants
                        and by lawyers. In many cases the answer is easy: but in others it is
                        difficult. The difficulty arises because of the nature of the question. It
                        assumes that all expenditure can be put correctly into one category or the
                        other. But this is simply not possible. Some cases lie on the border between
                        the two, and this border is not a line clearly marked out. It is a blurred
                        and undefined area in which anyone can get lost. Different minds may come to
                        different conclusions with equal propriety. It is like the border between
                        day and night, or between red and orange. Everyone can tell the difference
                        except in the marginal cases, and then everyone is in doubt. Each can come
                        down either way. When these marginal cases arise, then the practitioners, be
                        they accountants or lawyers, must of necessity put them into one category or
                        the other: and then, by custom or by law, by practice or by precept, the
                        border is staked out with more certainty. In this area, at least, where no
                        decision can be said to be right or wrong, the only safe rule is to go by
                        precedent. So the thing to do is to search through the cases and see whether
                        the instant problem has come up before. If so, go by it. If not, go by the
                        nearest you can find.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     At this juncture, we are, I would suggest,
                    dangerously close to moving (or even careening dangerously) down that slippery
                    slope which I cautioned that we should avoid, <em>viz</em>,
                    that “It all depends on the facts” (see also above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> and <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>).
                    Is it possible, in the circumstances, to arrive at <em>a
                        composite (albeit integrated) test</em> of sorts? In this regard, I am
                    fortified by the optimism demonstrated in the following observations of
                    Dixon J in the High Court of Australia decision of <em>Hallstroms Proprietary Limited v The Federal Commissioner of
                        Taxation</em> (1946) 72 CLR 634 (“<em>Hallstroms</em>”) (at 646):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>For myself, however, I am not prepared to concede that
                            the distinction between an expenditure on account of revenue and an
                            outgoing of a capital nature is so indefinite and uncertain as to remove
                            the matter from the operation of reason and place it exclusively within
                            that of chance, or that the discrimen is so unascertainable that it must
                            be placed in the category of an unformulated question of
                        fact</em>. The truth is that, in excluding as deductions losses and
                        outgoings of capital or of a capital nature, the income tax law took for its
                        purposes a very general conception of accountancy, perhaps of economics, and
                        left the particular application to be worked out, a thing which it thus
                        became the business of the courts of law to do. The courts have proceeded
                        with the task without, it is true, any very conspicuous attempt at analysis,
                        but rather in the traditional way of stating what positive factor or factors
                        in each given case led to a decision assigning the expenditure to capital or
                        to income as the case might be. It is one thing to say that the presence
                        among the circumstances of a case of a particular factor places the case
                        within a specific legal category. It is another thing to infer that the
                        absence of the same factor from some other case necessarily places that case
                        outside the category and gives it an opposite description. But towards that
                        kind of fallacy human reasoning constantly tends, and the decisions upon
                        matters of capital and income contain much reasoning that is quite human.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     All this is not to state that commonsense
                    ought to be avoided. Far from it. However, a <em>balanced</em> approach is required. As Megarry J observed in the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Simpson v Jones (Inspector of
                        Taxes)</em> [1968] 1 WLR 1066 (“<em>Simpson</em>”) (at 1074–1075):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In thickets so dense and statute-laden as the law of income tax, common
                        sense is, I suppose, a frail guide. Certainly it cannot become the master,
                        for then it would usurp the function of the Statute Book. But in territory
                        which remains unoccupied by either statute law or case law, I do not see why
                        common sense should be abjured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I should also observe that I am <em>unable</em> to endorse <em>fully</em>
                    the following observations by Viscount Radcliffe, delivering the judgment of the
                    court in the Privy Council decision in <em>Nchanga</em>,
                    where the learned law lord was (at 959) of the following view:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nevertheless, it has to be remembered that all these phrases, as, for
                        instance, “enduring benefit” or “capital
                        structure” are <em>essentially descriptive rather than
                            definitive</em>, and, as each new case arises for adjudication and
                        it is sought to reason by analogy from its facts to those of one previously
                        decided, a court's primary duty is to inquire how far a description that was
                        both relevant and significant in one set of circumstances is either
                        significant or relevant in those which are presently before it. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Whilst I agree – to a large extent – with the learned law
                    lord’s observations, to the extent that he views the various <em>legal</em> criteria as having merely <em>descriptive</em> (as opposed to <em>normative</em>) force, I must beg to differ. By <em>definition and inherent nature</em>, every <em>legal</em> rule or principle must <em>necessarily</em> have <em>normative</em> force
                    if it is to <em>be</em> a “<em>legal</em>” rule or principle that is, by definition,
                    potentially applicable in a <em>general</em> manner to all
                        <em>future</em> fact situations as well. However, I do
                    agree with Viscount Radcliffe that the various formulations in the various tests
                    are by no means “definitive”. Nevertheless, consistent with the
                    positive spirit expressed by Dixon J in <em>Hallstroms</em> (above at <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a>),
                    I shall endeavour to lay down what appear to me to be helpful <em>legal</em> principles that can aid the court in ascertaining whether
                    a particular expenditure is either capital or revenue in nature. Whilst they
                    should obviously be viewed as mere guidelines, I have endeavoured to state them
                    as <em>a related series of propositions, proceeding from the
                        first (which is general) to the second (which comprises particular
                        guidelines)</em>. The more particular or specific guidelines in the
                    latter are intended to <em>elaborate upon</em> the general
                    proposition (which comprises the former). It is also important to view the
                    various guidelines in the various tests as the “bridge” or
                    “link” between theory and practice. In particular, the guidelines
                    – being more <em>specific and particular</em> by
                    nature – assist courts in focusing on the <em>precise
                        facts</em> in the case at hand. It is important to note that they
                        <em>do</em> possess <em>normative</em> force (see above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>), although they are <em>more
                        specific</em> than the (<em>general</em>)
                    proposition embodied in the first proposition (below at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, I should add that there is nothing
                    new in so far as <em>content</em> is concerned. It is,
                    rather, an attempt to consolidate the various tests into <em>a
                        composite and integrated whole</em>. That such consolidation is
                    necessary is evident, it is suggested, from <em>the very
                        relationships amongst the various tests themselves</em>. Let me
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     First, as we have already seen above (at
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>), the “once and for
                    all” test has been <em>subsumed within</em> the
                    “enduring benefit of the trade” test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Secondly, as we have also seen above (at
                        <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>), there is an overlap (or even
                    complete coincidence or equivalence) between the “enduring benefit of the
                    trade” test and the “fixed capital and circulating capital”
                    test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Thirdly, we have also seen above (at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>) that there is a possible overlap (or even
                    complete coincidence or equivalence) between the “enduring benefit of the
                    trade” test and the “identifiable asset”
                test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the circumstances, it would appear that the
                    “enduring benefit of the trade” test (enunciated by Viscount
                    Cave LC in <em>Atherton</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>)) is, despite its weaknesses (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), probably still – in
                    substance at least – the main test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     With these preliminary observations in mind,
                    let us gather the various threads together and attempt to set out a composite
                    and integrated approach (comprising the two related propositions – one
                    general, the other specific – which I have already alluded to
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(b)   Gathering The Threads Together – A Proposed Composite
                And Integrated Approach</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(I)   The First Principle (General)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     
          <em>First</em>, the court
                    must, as a matter of general principle, look closely at the <em>purpose</em> of the expenditure and ascertain whether or not such
                    expenditure either <em>created a new asset or opened new fields
                        of trading not hitherto available to the taxpayer</em> (and see
                        <em>per</em> Lord Reid in <em>Carron</em> (at 68)) – in which case the expenditure concerned
                    would be capital (and not revenue) in nature. In the <em>former</em> respect, I would think that an expenditure which
                        <em>strengthens</em> an <em>existing
                        asset</em> would also be one that is capital in nature. The <em>latter</em> aspect (<em>viz</em>, the
                    opening of new fields of trading not hitherto available to the taxpayer) may
                    – on one view at least – be viewed as <em>a more
                        specific example of the former in so far as a new field of trading may be
                        viewed (in substance, if not also form) as a new asset which inures to the
                        benefit of the taxpayer</em>. A similar – and helpful
                        - idea as well as approach is contained within the
                    following passages from <em>Whiteman</em> (at
                    para 6-09 (although dealing with the distinction between revenue and
                    capital <em>receipts</em>, the <em>general</em> principles apply equally (as the authors themselves
                    quite correctly acknowledge) to the distinction between revenue and capital
                        <em>expenditure</em> as well (see <em>Whiteman</em> at para 7-02)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first test for distinguishing between revenue and capital receipts
                        requires transactions relating to <em>assets which form part
                            of the permanent structure of the business and are the means whereby
                            profits are earned</em>, to be <em>contrasted
                            with</em> transactions relating to <em>the
                            subject-matter of the trade</em>. Profits of the <em>former type</em> are <em>not</em>
                        chargeable to income tax, whilst those of the latter type are. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It is, I would observe, at this particular
                    juncture, that we find the (albeit general) confluence between law and fact,
                    between general rule (as well as principle) and the particular facts. However,
                    how, it might be asked, is one to ascertain whether or not an expenditure has
                    created a new asset (or strengthened) an existing asset, or opened new fields of
                    trading not hitherto available? This is a highly relevant (as well as
                    significant) question, and brings us to a second (and more specific, albeit
                    closely related) proposition (which effects, as we shall see, a specific and
                    complete (or bridging) confluence) between the general rule (as well as
                    principle) and the particular facts in the case concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(II)   The Second Principle (Comprising Specific
                Guidelines)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     
          <em>Secondly</em>,
                    whether or not an expenditure has created (or strengthened an existing asset),
                    or created a new field of trading not hitherto available to the taxpayer, would
                    lead us back to the various tests. In this regard, we have seen that we are, in
                    the main, brought back (see above at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>-<a href="#p1_69">[69]</a>) to the “enduring benefit of the trade” test
                    embodied in the proposition by Viscount Cave LC in <em>Atherton</em> (above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>). In
                    addition to that test, the following observations by Viscount Radcliffe in
                        <em>Nchanga</em> (at 960) seem to me to constitute a
                    cogent as well as practical approach (see also the endorsement by
                    Lord Upjohn in <em>Strick</em> (at 343)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Again, courts have stressed the importance of observing a <em>demarcation between the cost of creating, acquiring or
                            enlarging the permanent (which does not mean perpetual) structure of
                            which the income is to be the produce or fruit and the cost of earning
                            that income itself or performing the income-earning operations. Probably
                            this is as illuminating a line of distinction as the law by itself is
                            likely to achieve</em>, but the reality of the distinction, it
                        must be admitted, does not become the easier to maintain as tea systems in
                        different countries allow more and more kinds of capital expenditure to be
                        charged against profits by way of allowances for depreciation, and by so
                        doing recognise that at any rate the exhaustion of fixed capital is an
                        operating cost. Even so, the functions of business are capable of great
                        complexity and the line of demarcation is sometimes difficult indeed to draw
                        and leads to distinctions of some subtlety between profit that is made
                        “out of” assets and profit that is made “upon”
                        assets or “with” assets. It does not settle the question, for
                        instance, to say merely that an expenditure has been made to acquire a
                        “source of income,” as the appellant says here, unless one is
                        clear that some forms of circulating capital itself, e.g., labour, raw
                        material, stock-in-trade, are not themselves to be regarded as such a
                        source. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">One other set of observations which are, in my view, also of cogent as
                    well as practical assistance is to be found in the judgment of Dixon J in
                    the High Court of Australia decision of <em>Sun Newspapers
                        Limited v The Federal Commissioner of Taxation</em> (1938)
                    61 CLR 337 (“<em>Sun
                    Newspapers</em>”), as follows (at 636):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Again, the cases which distinguish between capital sums payable by
                        instalments and periodical payments analogous to rent payable on revenue
                        account illustrate the fact that rights and advantages of the same duration
                        and nature may be the subject of recurrent payments which are referable to
                        capital expenditure or income expenditure according to the true character of
                        the consideration given, that is, whether on the one hand it is a
                        capitalized sum payable by deferred instalments or on the other hire or rent
                        accruing <em>de die in diem</em>, or at other
                        intervals, for the use of the thing: Compare <em>Ogden</em> v. <em>Medway Cinemas Ltd</em>.
                        [(1934) 18 TC 691] with <em>Inland Revenue
                            Commissioners</em> v. <em>Adam</em> [(1928)
                        14 TC 34] and <em>Green</em> v. <em>Favourite Cinemas Ltd</em>. [(1930)
                        15 TC 390].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, I think, <b><em>three matters</em></b> to be
                        considered, <b><em>(a) the character of the advantage
                            sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the
                            manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this
                            and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the
                            means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or
                            outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the
                            payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future
                            use or enjoyment</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The guidelines set out in the preceding quotation are of particular
                    significance as well as utility because Dixon J attempts to consolidate as
                    well as integrate the tests and guidelines that had been set out in the prior
                    precedents. This is precisely the ideal which I have already referred to above
                    (at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>). Indeed, Lord Upjohn referred
                    to the judgment of Dixon J in <em>Sun Newspapers</em>
                    as containing “very useful observations” (see <em>Strick</em> (at 343)) and Lord Wilberforce referred to it a
                    “classic judgment” (see <em>Strick</em> (at
                    347)). Further, the learned authors of <em>Whiteman</em>
                    were “of the opinion that as valuable a guide as any in distinguishing
                    between capital and revenue expenditure is to be found in the classic judgment
                    of Dixon J. in <em>Sun Newspapers Ltd. v. Federal
                        Commissioner of Taxation</em>” (see <em>Whiteman</em> at para 7-06). Finally, in his very comprehensive
                    and erudite biography, Prof Philip Ayres observed that “the most
                    important common-law judgment [Dixon J] wrote in the late 1930s was that
                    for a revenue case, <em>Sun Newspapers Ltd</em>, the first
                    of several in which he analysed in a fresh way the concepts of capital and
                    revenue in relation to deductible outgoings, the analysis extending to capital
                    and income in relation to assessable income” (see Philip Ayres, <em>Owen Dixon</em> (The Miegunyah Press, 2003) at p 93).
                    The learned author also observed (at p 94) that “in writing his
                    judgment, Dixon, unlike his brother judges, had developed the
                    law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     More specifically, the authors of a leading
                    textbook have proffered – in the context of receipts (which would, in my
                    view, be applicable as a matter of general principle to expenditure as well)
                    – “five basic propositions which they consider emerge from the
                    cases on the capital/revenue receipt question”, as follows (see <em>Whiteman</em> at para 6-11):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Payments for the sale of the assets of a business

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Taking into account the various propositions
                    as well as observations set out in the preceding two paragraphs, the position
                        (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the <em>second</em> proposition) may (at least tentatively) be <em>summarised</em> as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     In ascertaining whether or not the
                        expenditure relates to the creation of a new asset or new field of trading
                        (or the strengthening thereof), the <em>purpose</em> of
                        the expenditure must be ascertained; in particular, the court should have
                        regard to the following guidelines (bearing in mind that the categories of
                        guidelines are not closed):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_75-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       The <em>manner</em> of the expenditure, in particular, whether the
                            expenditure was a one-time expenditure or a recurrent expenditure.
                            Although this is not conclusive in and of itself, a one-time expenditure
                            would tend to suggest that that expenditure is capital in
                        nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_75-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The <em>consequence or result</em> of the
                            expenditure. In particular, if the expenditure results in either the
                            strengthening of the existing core business structure of the taxpayer or
                            adds to that structure, it is more likely to be capital in nature. In
                            this regard, the concept of a “core business structure”
                            may be seen as comprising <em>the permanent (albeit not
                                necessarily perpetual) structure of the taxpayer’s business
                                which</em> is <em>utilised for the generation
                                of profits</em> and is (to that extent) to be viewed as
                            constituting the <em>(permanent) assets</em> of the
                            business itself (an oft-used analogy in this regard is the distinction
                            between the tree (which is the source of the fruit) and the fruit
                            itself). <em>However</em>, where the
                            “assets” are <em>themselves the
                                stock-in-trade</em> of the business, expenditure in relation
                            to such “assets” is more likely to be revenue in
                            nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     In applying the various guidelines set out above (as well as any
                        other specific (and applicable) guidelines to be found in the case law
                        generally), the <em>specific facts</em> are obviously
                        of the first importance. However, the facts – in and of themselves
                        – have no normative force and therefore cannot be the justification
                        (in and of themselves) for the decision arrived at by the court because to
                        do so would be, in effect, to hoist oneself by one’s own legal petard.
                        As noted in the introduction (above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), the categorisation of an expenditure as being of
                        capital or income nature cannot rest simply on the court’s appraisal
                        of the facts. Whilst different factors may be relevant in each case to the
                        determination of the nature of the expenditure in light of all the
                        circumstances of that case, the underlying principle is that for the
                        expenditure to be of a capital nature, the <em>first
                            principle</em> (as detailed above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>-<a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>), <em>viz</em>, that the
                        expenditure must have either created a new asset or opened new fields of
                        trading not hitherto available to the taxpayer, must be complied with. The
                        guidelines laid down at (a) above are useful factors to be considered
                        in the analysis of whether the expenditure in a particular case complies
                        with this principle although the weight of each factor depends upon the
                        nature of the expenditure. Moreover, previous decisions of the courts
                        provide guidance as to the factors which may point towards an income or
                        capital expenditure in each unique set of circumstances, particularly where
                        the facts of the case at hand are analogous to those in a previous
                        decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Let us turn now to apply the various tests in
                    general and the approach just proposed in particular to the facts of the present
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the tests and proposed approach to the facts of the
                present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The deductibility of the costs of acquiring the land and
                constructing the building</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is important, first, to set out the precise
                    factual matrix. As already mentioned, the Appellant was incorporated in order to
                    build and operate the Club. Hence, it was imperative that the Appellant acquire
                    the land as well as construct the requisite building in order to furnish the
                    basic (and permanent) infrastructure without which the Club could not even begin
                    to operate in the first instance. Indeed, the <em>raison
                        d’être</em> of the Club was to provide its members with the
                    promised facilities and such facilities required a land and a building to begin
                    with. The land and building themselves represent <em>assets as
                        well as (as just mentioned) basic (and permanent) infrastructure</em>
                    which belonged to the Appellant and did not comprise stock-in-trade which the
                    Appellant dealt with in the course of its business (which was, as also just
                    mentioned, to provide the promised <em>facilities</em> to
                    its members instead).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is also important to note, at this
                    juncture, that it would appear that the acquisition of land or any interest in
                    land would point very strongly to a <em>capital</em>
                    – as opposed to a revenue – expenditure (see also <em>Strick</em> at 336, <em>per</em>
                    Lord Pearce). Indeed, in <em>Strick</em> itself,
                    Lord Upjohn opined thus (at 341):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, <em>in the field of real property in relation to
                            taxation certain matters are so fundamental as now to be axiomatic.
                            Thus, in cases other than those where a man is a property dealer so that
                            property is his stock-in-trade it is quite clear that the purchase of a
                            fee simple for a purchase price by a trader is the acquisition of
                            property for the purposes of trade and the purchase cannot be regarded
                            as a cost of carrying on the trade, it is therefore capital</em>.
                        This is so though the trader may desire to acquire the property for the
                        purpose of providing himself with circulating capital by mining operations
                        on the property acquired, even if he is intending to acquire the property
                        only for a short time … Exactly the same principle applies if the
                        purchase price is payable by instalments spread over a period; it is a
                        capital payment. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The underlying rationale for the view
                    expressed in the preceding paragraph is both logical as well as commonsensical.
                    It stems not simply from an irrational fixation with real property. In other
                    words, it is not rooted in the concept of physicality but is, rather, related to
                    the concept of the acquisition of a real asset (to which the physical attributes
                    merely serve to drive home the point).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Turning to the various guidelines
                    (particularly those contained in the second principle set out above (see
                    especially at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>), it is clear that the
                    purchase of the land as well as the construction of the building by the
                    Appellant is a <em>one-time</em> expenditure. More
                    importantly, as already pointed out, the <em>result</em> of
                    such expenditure is the acquisition of an asset which simultaneously constitutes
                    the permanent (albeit not perpetual) structure of the Appellant’s business
                    of furnishing facilities to its members. That the asset is not perpetual is
                    clear since the lease is for 30 years, although that is not (as we have
                    just noted) a critical factor since permanence is not to be equated with
                    perpetuity. Moreover, the asset is lasting insofar as it lasts throughout the
                    duration of the trade and is not extinguished or diminished by each trading
                    transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Indeed, despite potential difficulties that
                    arise with regard to fact situations (especially in the context of tax), this is
                    (as I have detailed above) a very clear case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     However, perhaps recognising this, counsel for
                    the Appellant, Mr Gandhi, sought to argue along a completely different
                    tack, commencing from the fact that the lease was in fact for a fixed term of
                    30 years. In this regard, the sheet anchor of his case in terms of the case
                    law was the Privy Council decision in <em>British South
                        Africa</em>. In particular, Mr Gandhi argued that the Appellant
                    had, in economic substance, “sold” the entire assets of the Club
                        (<em>including the land and the building</em>)
                        <em>to its members</em>, especially if one has regard
                    to the fact that the lease is for a fixed period of 30 years. The argument
                    is an ingenious one but is – to put it mildly - rather
                    radical in the light of the conventional view that has been adopted <em>vis-à-vis</em> land and buildings (as briefly set out above).
                    More importantly, it is an argument which does not, with respect, comport with
                    what was the true bargain between the Appellant on the one hand and each of its
                    members on the other. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The essence of the transaction between the
                    Appellant and each of its members was clear right from the outset. In the
                    application form for membership, each applicant had, in the section entitled
                    “Applicant’s Declaration”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> to
                    declare, <em>inter alia</em>, the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am fully aware and agree that the right to utilise and enjoy the
                        Facilities and membership herein <em>does not confer upon me
                            any rights, title or interest in any property or Assets owned by the
                            Proprietor or in the Facilities or the Assets</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The declaration set out in the preceding
                    paragraph did not comprise mere formal words devoid of substance or meaning.
                    That this is the case is confirmed in no uncertain terms by the salient Rules
                    and Regulations of the Club (“Rules and Regulations”) themselves.
                    Indeed, it is clear beyond peradventure that the Rules and Regulations comprise
                    a binding legal contract between the Appellant on the one hand and each of its
                    members on the other. In particular, Rule 21.2<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and (especially)
                        Rule 34<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> of the Rules and Regulations

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It is clear beyond any doubt whatsoever, from
                    the rules reproduced in the preceding paragraphs, that every member of the Club
                    was only furnished with a <em>licence</em> to use the
                    facilities of the Club and that all the assets of the Club (which included the
                    land and the building) belonged to the Appellant. This could not, in my view,
                    have been expressed in clearer language than that contained in the
                    aforementioned Rules. As already noted, however, the Appellant nevertheless
                    continued to argue that all the assets of the Club had, in economic substance,
                    been conveyed by the Appellant to the members. Since legal title to, <em>inter alia</em>, the land and the building continued to
                    reside in the Appellant, if the Appellant is correct in its argument, this must
                    mean that it holds, <em>inter alia</em>, the land and the
                    building <em>on trust</em> for its members. With respect,
                    this is an argument that is a last-ditch attempt to avoid what is clear from the
                    facts and the case law – which is that the land and the building
                    constitute <em>capital</em> (and <em>not</em> revenue) expenditure (see the analysis above at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>-<a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>). When pressed during oral submissions, even Mr Gandhi
                    (quite correctly and candidly, in my view) conceded that the argument from a
                    trust was difficult to maintain, to say the least. Indeed, it is clear, from the
                        <em>contract</em> between the Appellant on the one hand
                    and each of its members on the other, that only a <em>licence</em> was granted to the latter by the former. Nothing could
                    be plainer and this is wholly consistent with the <em>context</em> of the business of the Appellant, <em>viz</em>, the operation of a club for the benefit of its members.
                    Indeed, if the Appellant’s argument holds good, then every member of every
                    club which is operated from land belonging to a club that is of a fixed duration
                    would be able to claim <em>pro rata ownership</em> of the
                    assets of the club concerned. A moment’s reflection will reveal that this
                    is, with respect, completely untenable. There was no evidence whatsoever of an
                    underlying (and alternative) arrangement between the Appellant and its members.
                    Indeed, the Appellant’s argument creates interpretive contortions where
                    none is present and distorts, in the process, the clear and unambiguous language
                    as well as intention underlying the contractual relationship between the parties
                    themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     However, relying on the Privy Council decision
                    in <em>British South Africa</em>, Mr Gandhi
                    nevertheless persevered during oral submissions with this line of argument. With
                    respect, however, a close reading of that decision will reveal a <em>very different</em> context as well as fact situation
                    altogether. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The fact situation in <em>British South Africa</em> was a straightforward one. Simplifying the
                    facts somewhat, the appellant taxpayer, which was incorporated by Royal Charter,
                    had acquired numerous concessions with regard to minerals and mining rights. It
                    subsequently granted concessions conferring prospecting as well as other rights
                    in respect of the minerals it owned to third parties and the issue arose as to
                    whether or not the receipts in money and shares from the third parties was to be
                    included as income for the purposes of income tax. The Privy Council held,
                    first, that whilst the receipts did not fall within s 5(<em>f</em>) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Northern Rhodesia (relating to
                    “rents, royalties, premiums and any other profits arising from
                    property”), they fell, instead, with s 5(<em>a</em>) of the same Ordinance (relating to “gains or profits
                    from any trade, business, profession or vocation”). However, the further
                    issue arose as to whether or not there could be a <em>deduction</em> in favour of the appellant taxpayer against these
                    receipts. In this regard, Viscount Simon, who delivered the judgment of the
                    court, observed thus (at 80–81):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If, however, <em>the business of the company was (as, in
                            their Lordships’ opinion, it was) to “turn to
                            account” its mining rights or other property</em>, it does
                        not follow that the proceeds of such turning to account are chargeable to
                        tax without any deduction for the cost of acquisition. Rather it would seem
                        that the ordinary rule must apply, and that no gain or profit can be said to
                        arise unless and until a balance has been struck between the cost of
                        acquisition and the proceeds of sale. Nor is it, in their Lordships’
                        opinion, material that in dealing with its mineral rights the company has
                        retained an interest either by way of a possible reverter of the property or
                        by a shareholding in a company to which it made a special grant. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The licences were exclusive, conditional, non-transferable, for a
                    period of years only and subject to forfeiture. However, in their
                    Lordships’ view, it was immaterial that in dealing with its mineral
                    rights, the company retained an interest either by way of a possible reverter of
                    the property or by a shareholding in a company to which it made a special grant.
                    Whilst Viscount Simon acknowledged the general rule to the effect that where the
                    income of a taxpayer is derived from the exhaustion of a capital asset, no
                    deduction can be allowed for the cost of that asset, he was of the view that an
                        <em>exception</em> to that rule existed, as follows (at
                    82):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But it appears to them that it [the general rule just referred to] is
                        excluded as soon as the conclusion is reached that the article sold is that
                        which it was the business of the company to acquire and to sell. So, here,
                        though the mixed character of the company's objects as stated in the
                        preamble of its Charter makes it difficult to define its trade or business,
                        yet it appears reasonably clear that in order to effectuate its desire (to
                        use the words of the preamble) “to carry into effect divers
                        concessions and agreements. ... and such other concessions agreements grants
                        and treaties as the petitioners may hereafter obtain” the acquisition
                        and realization of mining rights must take a leading place. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the circumstances, the court was of the view that, as some
                    deduction ought to be allowed, the judgment of the Rhodesian Court of Appeal to
                    the contrary was set aside, and the matter was referred back to the Commissioner
                    of Income Tax for re-assessment “to the best of its judgment”
                    pursuant to s 40(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Ordinance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It can be seen immediately that the fact
                    situation in <em>British South Africa</em> was <em>completely different from</em> that which obtained in the
                    present proceedings. Put simply, the <em>very pith and marrow of
                        the business of the taxpayer</em> in <em>British South
                        Africa</em> centred on not only the acquisition, <em>but also the sale</em>, of its mineral concessions and mining rights.
                    In other words, these concessions and rights constituted <em>the
                        stock-in-trade</em> of the taxpayer and were therefore deductible
                    against the income it received. In the present proceedings, however, the
                        <em>pith and marrow of the business of the
                        Appellant</em> is <em>not</em> the acquisition
                    and sale of the land or the building – or, indeed, <em>any</em> of the assets of the Club for that matter. On the <em>contrary</em>, the Appellant’s business centred on the
                    operation of the Club for the benefit of its members. Indeed, the members did
                        <em>not</em> possess any rights to the assets of the
                    Club. As I have demonstrated above, they merely obtained a <em>licence</em> to use the facilities of the Club in accordance with the
                    terms contained in the Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It is my view that the case that <em>is</em> in point is <em>A B Ltd</em>. Indeed, both parties were referred to this
                    case prior to oral submissions. This case cited <em>British South
                        Africa</em>, and Mr Gandhi chose (as pointed out above) to rely
                    on the latter case instead. However, as I have already elaborated upon above,
                        <em>British South Africa</em> is <em>not</em> relevant to the present appeal. In <em>A B Ltd</em> itself, the respondents were estate owners
                    carrying on the trade or business of rubber planting in different parts of
                    Malaya. After the Japanese occupation, they resumed the business of rubber
                    planting, with the exception of a portion of an estate on Singapore Island. This
                    particular portion of the estate had had all its rubber trees felled during the
                    Japanese occupation. The high cost of replanting as well as the relative
                    infertility of the land itself made the resumption of rubber growing an
                    economically unfeasible prospect. The respondents therefore applied to the
                    Government of the day for permission to use the said land for burial purposes
                    and a licence was duly issued to the respondents for the same. The respondents
                    then built a temple, a tiffin shed as well as caretaker’s quarters and an
                    access road on the land itself. They also appointed one of their staff as a
                    caretaker at a small wage but with free quarters to look after the buildings and
                    site as well as to show the site to prospective purchasers of burial plots. This
                    particular business grew and the area for burial purposes expanded as a result.
                    The Comptroller of Income Tax subsequently assessed the respondents to tax on
                    the excess of the latter’s income over their expenditure. The issue arose
                    as to whether or not when the respondents made available a burial plot to a
                    member of the public, that was an outright sale of the plot concerned or whether
                    it was merely the grant of a licence. If it was the latter and the respondents
                    were subject to assessment to income tax, the further issue arose as to whether
                    or not the capital cost of the road, the temple, the tiffin shed and the
                    caretaker’s quarters as well as the capital cost of the land itself could
                    be <em>deducted</em> against the revenues received by the
                    respondents <em>vis-à-vis</em> the burial
                plots.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Court of Appeal held that the respondents
                    had only granted a <em>licence</em> to each member of the
                    public to use the plot concerned for burial purposes and the revenue received
                    was therefore liable to be assessed for the purposes of income tax. Indeed, it
                    is significant, at this juncture, to point to the analogous situation which
                    exists in respect of the facts of the present proceedings. As already pointed
                    out above, the contractual relationship between the Appellant and each of its
                    members was clearly that of a licensor-licensee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Returning to the second issue (relating to
                    whether or not the various costs referred to above (at <a href="#p1_91">[91]</a>) could be deducted), the court held that it was clear that
                    the expenditure on these various costs constituted <em>capital</em> expenditure. In the absence of an applicable capital
                    allowance being granted <em>via</em> legislation, such
                    costs could therefore not be deducted by the respondents against the revenue
                    that they had received in respect of the granting of licences to members of the
                    public to use the plots concerned for burial purposes. The court also held that
                    the holding in <em>British South Africa</em> could
                        <em>not</em> be invoked as an alternative route for the
                    taxpayer concerned to obtain the benefit of a deduction. Both Whitton J and
                    Tan Ah Tah J distinguished the <em>British South
                        Africa</em> case on two grounds. First, in their transactions
                    concerning the land, the taxpayers in <em>A B Ltd</em> only sold certain rights of burial over the
                    land but not the land itself, unlike the <em>British South
                        Africa</em> case where the taxpayer acquired and realised mining
                    rights. Secondly, whilst it was the taxpayer’s business in the <em>British South Africa</em> case to acquire and realise mining
                    rights, the disposal of lots of land for burial purposes in <em>A B Ltd</em> was, at most, an entirely incidental business
                    upon which the taxpayers had embarked; the taxpayers’ business was, in
                    fact, that of rubber planting. Whilst counsel for the Appellant rightly observed
                    that the second reason does not apply to the present proceedings since it is the
                    Appellant’s business to sell the Club memberships, the first reason
                    discussed above, upon which the facts of <em>A B Ltd</em> were distinguished from that in the <em>British South Africa</em> case, is pertinent here and the
                    dicta of Whitton J and Tan Ah Tah J discussing this reason are set out
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Having noted that it was within the
                    company’s objects to realise its land by selling it for burial lots,
                    Whitton J commented (at 149) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As far as the mere selling is concerned I am, therefore, disposed to think
                        the appellants are on good ground, but I see some difficulty in that when
                        the Privy Council spoke of something “which it was the business of
                        the company to acquire and sell” it seems reasonable to infer what
                        was envisaged was something which in the normal course of events would

                            and sale</em>; and accordingly I think it does not necessarily
                        follow the principle would apply to land, a commodity which in the ordinary
                        way would not fall within this description, and in fact in the present case
                        does so only by reason of the particular use to which the appellants turned
                        it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     And the following observations by Tan Ah
                    Tah J (at 153) merit quotation in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The last point which remains to be considered arises out of the
                        proposition put by counsel for the appellants that if the appellants were
                        held to be carrying on a trade they would be entitled to claim the market
                        value of the land as a deduction from the income derived from the sale of
                        burial rights. In support of this proposition counsel for the appellants
                        cited, <b><em>inter alia</em></b>, the case of <b><em>British South Africa Co. v. Commissioner of Income
                            Tax</em></b> [[1946] AC 62]. <em>It is to be
                            observed that in that case an important part of the business of the
                            appellant company was the acquisition of mining rights on terms which
                            seemed most advantageous to the appellant company. In short, it was the
                            business of the appellant company in that case to acquire and realize
                            mining rights. Now the principle which is ordinarily applicable is to be
                            found in such cases</em>, decided under the English Income Tax
                        Acts, as <b><em>Alianza Co., Ltd. v. Bell</em></b> [[1905]
                        1 KB 184] which <em>establish that where the income
                            of a taxpayer is derived from the exhaustion of a capital asset no
                            deduction can be allowed for the cost of that asset</em>.
                            <em>What was decided in</em><b><em>British South Africa Co. v. Commissioner of Income
                            Tax</em></b><b>wa</b>s <em>that this principle is
                            excluded in cases where the article sold is that which it was the
                            business of the taxpayer to acquire and to sell</em>. <b><em>Now it is clear that in the present case the appellants’
                            business was not the acquisition of land for the purpose of selling it
                            as burial plots. The appellants’ business was that of rubber
                            planters but because of the high cost of replanting and the infertile
                            nature of the area in question they decided to use part of it as a
                            cemetery. I have already stated my view that in their transactions
                            concerning the land they only sold certain rights of burial over the
                            plots of land but not the land itself. There is therefore a fundamental
                            distinction between the facts of the present case and those in British
                            South Africa Co. v. Commissioner of Income Tax</em></b>. In my opinion
                        the decision in <b><em>British South Africa Co. v. Commissioner
                            of Income Tax</em></b> does <em>not</em> support
                        the appellants’ contention that deductions of the market value of the
                        land should be allowed. On this point I have reached the conclusion that the
                        principle which was applied in <b><em>Alianza Co., Ltd. v.
                            Bell</em></b> also be applied in the present case. [emphasis added in
                        italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Not surprisingly, perhaps, the observations
                    just quoted in the preceding two paragraphs apply with equal force to the
                    present appeal. As opposed to the assets in the <em>British South
                        Africa</em> case which were transferred upon sale, albeit with the
                    taxpayer retaining some rights in the assets in the form of a possible reverter
                    of property or through its shareholding in companies to which it had sold the
                    mining rights, the Appellant in the present case retains ownership of the Club
                    premises, as discussed above (at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>).
                    Whilst the Appellant in the present case may have acquired the Club premises in
                    order that he may operate his business, the Appellant has not realised these
                    assets. The fact that the Appellant had granted memberships which are
                    co-terminous with its lease of the premises does not derogate from the fact
                    that, after granting the memberships, the Appellant still retained ownership of
                    the lease and Club building. It is clear, from the perspectives of both legal
                    principle as well as factual application, that <em>British South
                        Africa</em> is <em>wholly inapplicable</em> to
                    the facts of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For the reasons set out above, it is clear
                    that the cost of acquiring the land and of constructing the building are
                        <em>capital</em> in nature and hence fall within the
                    ambit of s 15(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Act. No deduction
                    is legally permissible and the Appellant therefore fails with regard to this
                    particular issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The deductibility of the Geomancy Fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The Appellant submitted that the
                    categorisation of the Geomancy Fees as income or capital expenditure follows the
                    categorisation of the costs of purchasing the land and building the Club. As
                    such, the Geomancy Fees are not deductible from the income of the Appellant as
                    they are of a capital nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the sum of $53,283,000 is deductible in the Year of
                Assessment 2001</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Section 14(1) of the Act provides that
                    expenditure is deductible in the period in which it is incurred. The Appellant
                    seeks to deduct, from the income earned through the receipt of the entrance
                    fees, the $3,000 that it had undertaken to pay to each member of the Club
                    following the civil action taken against it for which the Court of Appeal had
                    handed down its decision determining the Appellant’s liability in 2003 and
                    had decided on the extent of the Appellant’s liability in 2005. In 2003,
                    the Court of Appeal held that by failing to control the number of people the
                    Club had admitted as members, it had breached its obligation of delivering a
                    premier club to those who were admitted. In 2005, the sum of $3,000 was assessed
                    as damages arising from the breach and measured by the diminution in value of
                    the Club due to the reach. The Court of Appeal made it clear that the plaintiffs
                    were only trying to determine the loss due to the breach. It is clear from the
                    judgment of the Court of Appeal that the sum of $3,000 was calculated as damages
                    arising from the breach rather than as a refund of the entrance
                fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The Appellant seeks to reopen the tax
                    assessment in the Year of Assessment 2001 in order to deduct, from the income
                    earned in that year, the sum of $53,283,000 which it was liable to pay to the
                    members (see above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). The Appellant
                    points out that its breach of contractual obligations can be linked back to the
                    opening of the Club in March 2000. The Appellant argues that when liability is
                    determined, it should be related back to and be deductible from the profits in
                    the year in which the incident giving rise to such liability occurred. On the
                    other hand, the Respondent argues that as no liability had been ascertained in
                    2000, the Appellant had no clear legal obligation to pay such moneys to its
                    members at that point in time and cannot deduct the sum of $53,283,000 from the
                    income received in those years of assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The issue that arises in the present context
                    is whether, for the purposes of tax assessment, the liability to pay the sum of
                    $53,283,000 to the members is deemed to have accrued on the date the cause of
                    action arose (in March 2000), as the Appellant submits. In my view, the
                    liability, not having been admitted or adjudged to exist on the date the breach
                    occurred, did not accrue in March 2000 and the sum of $53,283,000 is therefore
                    not deductible in the subsequent Year of Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The sheet anchor of the Appellant for this
                    particular issue – in so far as the relevant cases law is concerned
                    – is the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Bernhard</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The decision in <em>Bernhard</em> can, in fact, be distinguished as the liability in
                    respect of the debt owed to the bank had already crystallised and the issue
                    before the court was merely one of <em>quantum</em>,
                        <em>viz</em>, whether or not £22,410 or
                    £8,000 (which was the amount the bank ultimately agreed to accept in full
                    settlement of the debt owed) should appear in the accounts (see also <em>Simpson</em>, especially at 1074). Unlike the present case
                    where the Appellant’s liability to pay damages to the members of the club
                    had not been ascertained in the years of assessment in which the Appellant seeks
                    a deduction of the damages paid from profits assessed to tax, the liability of
                    the taxpayer in <em>Bernhard</em> was undisputed at the
                    time the liability was included in the taxpayer’s tax assessments as a
                    deductible expense. It was the quantum of the liability that had yet to be
                    ascertained, specifically, the amount by which the liability was to be reduced.
                    The taxpayer in <em>Bernhard</em> was a trader who exported
                    cloth to buyers overseas. He financed his business by borrowing money from a
                    bank on the security of bills and shipping documents. The advances made by the
                    bank to the taxpayer were satisfied out of the proceeds of the bills. In 1920,
                    the taxpayer was liable to the bank in respect of the bills which he had
                    discounted with the bank and that liability, at its face value, was a sum of
                    £45,000. A considerable deduction would have to be made from this figure in
                    respect of goods which, if not paid for by the buyer of the goods, could be sold
                    and the proceeds of the goods would be received by the bank in reduction of the
                    liability upon the bills. The amount by which the liability was to be reduced
                    had not yet been ascertained. In computing his profits for the year ended
                    31 March 1921, the taxpayer was allowed to deduct a sum of £22,410,
                    being the estimated amount of the bank’s claim against him. Subsequently,
                    at the end of 1922, the bank accepted £8,000 in settlement of its claim
                    against the taxpayer. The English Court of Appeal ordered that the
                    taxpayer’s assessments be reopened to adjust the sum of £22,410
                    deducted as a trading loss in 1921 to reflect the amount of the taxpayer’s
                    actual liability to the bank (<em>i.e</em>., £8,000).
                    It is clear from the decision of the court that the fact of liability was
                    determined in 1921 although the quantum of liability was still being disputed.
                    In particular, Lord Hanworth MR commented (at 742) that “it
                    seems quite impossible to hold that there was anything more than an interim
                    determination when the £22,410 was reached, and a determination which could
                    be revised by the later events” and Lawrence LJ characterised (at
                    745) the “real dispute between the parties in this case” as
                    “the amount of the deductions which can properly be made from [the] sum
                    of £45,000.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The Appellant seeks to rely on the following
                    observations in <em>Bernhard</em> by
                    Lord Hanworth MR (at 741):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have had a powerful argument by Mr Dickinson … He has said,
                        and quoted authorities to shew … that if there is a liability which
                        is subsequently determined, but which is none the less to be a liability
                        existing at a particular date, the fact that it is, subsequently to that
                        date, determined and ascertained, does not prevent that liability belonging
                        historically to its right place in the accounts. The quantum of it is
                        ascertained at a later date; but the payment is to be made as at the date
                        when it rightly occurs in the accounts, even if the quantum of it cannot be
                        fixed at that moment … All those principles which were contended for
                        are true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As discussed above at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>, the facts of <em>Bernhard</em> are different from those in the present case. Thus,
                    Lord Hanworth MR’s observations only apply to the situation
                    where liability has already been ascertained in the Year of Assessment but the
                    quantum of liability is determined at a later stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Indeed, the need for an <em>actual</em> legal obligation or liability to be incurred or to have
                    been crystallised can be seen from the Scottish Court of Session decision of
                        <em>James Spencer &amp; Co v Commissioners of Inland
                        Revenue</em> (1950) 32 TC 111 (“<em>James Spencer</em>”). There, the Lord President Cooper,
                    having referred, <em>inter alia</em>, to the decisions in
                        <em>Newcastle Breweries</em> and <em>Bernhard</em>, held (at 117) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it seems to follow that, if in the earlier period there is only a
                        provisional or contingent “liability”, it is not until it has
                        been subsequently determined to be an actual “liability” by
                        admission or decision that it can properly be brought into computation, and
                        it should then be debited even if it is not until a still later period that
                        the exact quantum can be inserted, if need be by re-opening the
                        accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>James Spencer</em> concerned the date on
                    which liability for workmen’s compensation claims were to be included. It
                    was held that the claims were not to be properly included until they had been
                    admitted or determined. Lord President Cooper held (at 117) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Until then the “liability” is only provisional or contingent
                        for the purposes of tax computation. The contingency is purified and the
                        provisional “liability” becomes actual when the fact of
                        “liability” is so ascertained, and it is then that the debit
                        should appear in the accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Applying the decision in <em>James Spencer</em>
                    to the facts of the present case, the Appellant’s liability to pay $3,000
                    to each member only became actual when the fact of liability was ascertained by
                    the Court of Appeal in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Appellant also refers to the decision of
                    the Privy Council in <em>Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Lo and
                        Lo (a firm)</em> [1984] STC 366 (“<em>Lo and Lo</em>”) where it was held (at 370) that
                    “‘an expense incurred’ is not confined to a disbursement, and
                    must at least include a sum which there is an obligation to pay, that is to say
                    an accrued liability which is undischarged.” This applies irrespective of
                    whether the recipient of the disbursement has the choice to forfeit his right to
                    payment. In <em>Lo and Lo</em>, the taxpayers operated a
                    staff retirement benefit scheme whereby a retiring employee who had completed
                    not less than 10 years’ service was entitled to a lump sum payment.
                    It was held (at 371) that whilst a long service employee had a vested right to
                    his accrued lump sum payment such that the taxpayer had an accrued liability for
                    that sum, the employees who had not worked for at least 10 years did not
                    have any present right to demand payment and different considerations may apply
                    in their cases. This decision does not support the Appellant’s claim to
                    deduct the damages paid to its members in the year the alleged breach of
                    contract occurred. There was no obligation to pay damages at that particular
                    point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The editors of <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> state (at para 205.098)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Expenses which are anticipatory in nature, commonly referred to in
                        accounting parlance as ‘provisions’ where a sum is set aside by
                        a taxpayer at the end of the basis period to meet a liability which is
                        merely contingent, are not deductible for the relevant Year of Assessment.
                        Such anticipatory expenses remain so until such time, if any, a legal
                        liability to pay <em>actually crystallises</em>, at
                        which point then, the amount which is actually incurred will rank for
                        deduction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Other case authorities also support the view
                    that a taxpayer must be committed to an expenditure, even if this liability is
                    defeasible, in order for the expenditure to be treated as having been incurred.
                    In the High Court of Australia decision of <em>New Zealand Flax
                        Investments Ltd v FCT</em> (1938-39) 61 CLR 179, quoted with
                    approval in many subsequent cases (see, for example the New Zealand High Court
                    decision of <em>A M Bisley Ltd v CIR</em> (1985)
                    8 TRNZ 513 (at 528); as well as the High Court of Australia decisions
                    of <em>FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd</em> (1953–54)
                    88 CLR 492 (at 507) and <em>Nilsen Development
                        Laboratories Pty Ltd v FCT</em> (1979–80) 144 CLR 616
                        (“<em>Nilsen Laboratories</em>”) (at
                    623)), Dixon J attempted to define the term “incurred” for
                    the purposes of determining the deductible expenditure for tax purposes; the
                    learned judge observed as follows (at 207):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there must be a loss or outgoing actually incurred.
                        “Incurred” does not mean only defrayed, discharged, or borne,
                        but rather it includes encountered, run into, or fallen upon. It is unsafe
                        to attempt exhaustive definitions of a conception intended to have such a
                        various or multifarious application. But it <em>does not
                            include a loss or expenditure which is no more than impending,
                            threatened, or expected</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Nilsen Laboratories</em>, Barwick CJ
                    placed emphasis on Dixon J’s statement that the term
                    “incurred” “does not include a loss or expenditure which is
                    no more than impending, threatened, or expected” and added the phrase
                    “no matter how certain it is in the year of income that that loss or
                    expenditure will occur in the future” to it. Similarly, in the Privy
                    Council decision (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand) of
                        <em>Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New
                        Zealand Ltd</em> [1996] AC 315 (“<em>Mitsubishi Motors</em>”), the court held (at 327) that to
                    determine whether a liability was incurred, the question is whether “in
                    the light of surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in
                    the future can be said to have accrued”. The taxpayer in <em>Mitsubishi Motors</em> sold motor vehicles and provided a
                    warranty to its dealers under the terms of which the dealers were entitled to
                    return the vehicle to the taxpayer for repair if a defect arose within a certain
                    period or mileage use of the vehicle after delivery. The taxpayer was able to
                    estimate that some 63% of all vehicles it sold contained defects which would
                    manifest themselves within the warranty period and was able to make a reasonably
                    accurate forecast of the total cost of remedial work of these vehicles. The
                    court held that the fact that 63% of the vehicles had defects was a matter of
                    existing fact, not future contingency and that the contingency that some owners
                    might be content not to require remedial work would be real only in the case of
                    the most trivial defects. As such, the court allowed the taxpayer to deduct the
                    estimated repair costs from its profits in the year that the vehicles were
                    sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In the present proceedings, there is no
                    provision in the contract between the Appellant and the members of the Club to
                    the effect that the members would be entitled to damages if the number of
                    members in the club exceeded a stipulated number. The liability of the Appellant
                    to the members for damages for breach of contract was a contingent and yet to be
                    determined liability at the date when the cause of action accrued (and was later
                    contested). Since the Appellant’s liability to pay damages was only
                    determined by the Court of Appeal much later, the money paid to the members was
                    not deductible in the Year of Assessment 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Accounting treatment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Where ordinary accounting principles run
                    counter to the principles of tax law, they must yield to the latter for the
                    purposes of computing gains and profits for tax. Accounting and tax have
                    different objectives in mind: Financial accounting is intended to provide
                    information regarding firm performance to the market place while taxable income
                    is prescribed by the government to meet budgetary needs (see Michelle
                    Hanlon &amp; Terry Shevlin, “Book-Tax Conformity for Corporate
                    Income: An Introduction to the Issues” in (2005) 19 Tax Policy and
                    the Economy 101 at 106). Regardless of how persuasive accounting evidence is,
                    the prerogative still lies with the court to decide whether a particular item
                    should be regarded as income that has accrued for the purposes of liability to
                    tax (see <em>Pinetree</em> at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In so far as the specific question of what
                    is capital and what is revenue, this is a “question of law for the
                    courts” and the courts are “not to be deflected from their true
                    course by the evidence of accountants, however eminent” (see the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Heather</em>, <em>per</em> Lord Denning MR at 217). Accounting
                    treatment focuses on the balance sheet whereas taxation requirements are centred
                    on the profit and loss accounts, so that the distinctions between revenue and
                    capital, which are vital for tax purposes, may be lost in the accounting
                    treatment (see Judith Freedman, “Defining Taxable Profit in a Changing
                    Accounting Environment” (1995) 5 BTR 434 at 438). Items which may be
                    listed as deductible expenditure in the accounts may be considered capital
                    expenditure under the Act and therefore not deductible for income tax
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    At the hearing before the Board in the
                    present proceedings, the Appellant sought to rely on accounting evidence to show
                    that it would be wrong to regard the company’s revenue from entrance fees
                    as having no costs associated with it. The Appellant called three accountants to
                    give expert testimony as to how the various items of claim of the Appellant
                    ought to be treated. The Comptroller also called an expert witness to give
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    However, in their submissions to this court,
                    both the Appellant and the Respondent agreed that even if the accounts were
                    prepared in accordance with the correct principles of commercial accountancy,
                    they cannot be used to determine profit for tax purposes if they do not conform
                    with the provisions of the Act. What they disagree on is the effect of the
                    application of tax principles to the facts of the present case. In <em>Pinetree</em>, the Court of Appeal noted (at [33]) that a
                    court has an overriding power to form its own conclusions and that this is
                    particularly so when the issue at hand has been accepted by the party concerned
                    (in that case, the appellants) to be a question of law as the facts are not in
                    dispute. I am also of the view that the present case turns on how
                    well-established tax principles and tax law would apply rather than on the
                    correct accounting treatment of the items brought to tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Although Mr Gandhi is to be commended
                    for the enthusiasm and candour with which he argued his client’s case, the
                    Appellant’s arguments with regard to all the issues fail for the reasons I
                    have set out above. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs and with the
                    usual consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    I would also like to take this opportunity
                    to reiterate my gratitude (which was expressed after oral submissions) to both
                    counsel for presenting their arguments clearly and as persuasively as they
                    could. This is especially welcome in the context of the law of tax which, by its
                    very nature, can be extremely technical and complex indeed.</p>
