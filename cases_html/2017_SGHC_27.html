</div> Until the Plaintiff’s notice of election of 16 July 2008, UOB was unaware that it had to meet a claim for an account of profits and therefore could not have paid the sum of S$1,962,424.30 to the Plaintiff. Alternatively, UOB submitted that interest should commence from 8 October 2004, which was the date that it was served with the writ of summons.

FCC argued that because the Plaintiff did not provide evidence that FCC was notified of the claim in the action prior to the date of the writ of summons, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 October 2004, FCC should only be liable to pay interest from that date.  FCC argued that the Plaintiff should not be awarded interest for the entire period due to the Plaintiff’s dilatory conduct. FCC argued that the Plaintiff was responsible for a delay of nearly 4 years, from September 2012 to July 2016, by embarking on a fruitless attempt to claim the 3% Uplift from UOB.

In this case, the issue of liability and the issue of remedies were dealt with at different stages due to the bifurcation of the action. I agreed that until UOB received the Plaintiff’s notice of election of remedy on 16 July 2008, it was unclear to UOB how it was to work out the amount that would be payable to the Plaintiff. Therefore, the date of commencement of pre-judgment interest should be 16 July 2008. The period would end on the date when interim payment was effected since the judgment amount finally awarded against UOB did not exceed the interim payment amount. The payment was effected on 2 February 2010 when UOB’s solicitors wrote to the Plaintiff’s solicitors enclosing the cheque for the interim payment.

</div> I therefore ordered UOB to pay interest at 5.33% per annum on the interim payment amount from 16 July 2008 to 2 February 2010. This sum was calculated by UOB to be S$162,483.89.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The same reasoning for UOB’s case applied to FCC in relation to the date of commencement of pre-judgment interest.  Therefore, I held that the date of commencement of pre-judgment interest against FCC should also be 16 July 2008.  I did not accept FCC’s argument that the Plaintiff was entitled to no more than half of the interest calculated on an accrual basis in the light of my finding at [92] of the judgment on damages that the parties were equally responsible for the delay in the conduct of the Assessment Hearing. However, ordering the interest to run until the date of the judgment on damages would be unfair to FCC given the Plaintiff’s refusal to accept the Joint OTS in 2016, which would have put the Plaintiff in a better position as compared to its position at the end of the Assessment Hearing. Accordingly, I ordered that the interest in FCC’s case should accrue at 5.33% per annum on the judgment sum of S$4.795m from 16 July 2008 to 10 June 2016, which is the end of the 14-day period that the Joint OTS should remain open for acceptance pursuant to O 22A r 3(1) of the ROC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ positions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Plaintiff argued that all parties to the Assessment Hearing should bear their own costs, with the exception that FCC should pay the Plaintiff’s disbursements in relation to expert fees incurred for the Assessment Hearing.

</div>
</div> The Plaintiff argued that disbursements for expert fees were substantial and ought to be borne by FCC. The basis for the Plaintiff’s general position was that the Plaintiff had succeeded in its claim for damages against FCC while failing in equal measure in its claim for account of profits against UOB. Since FCC was indemnifying UOB for the costs of the entire proceedings, the costs that UOB would obtain from the Plaintiff were likely to be offset by the costs that FCC would have to pay the Plaintiff.

</div> The Plaintiff also argued that indemnity costs should not be ordered against it in relation to its claim against UOB because there were no exceptional circumstances warranting such an order. The Plaintiff argued that it had not been unreasonable in its pursuit of its claim against UOB because there were inconsistencies in UOB’s position, something which was admitted by its own witnesses.

UOB submitted that from 2 February 2010 up to 5 December 2012, it ought to be entitled to costs on a standard basis and from 5 December 2012 onwards to date, it ought to be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis. This was because of UOB’s OTS of 5 December 2012, which did not stipulate a time for acceptance and which was not withdrawn. Therefore, under O 22A r 9(3), since the Plaintiff did not obtain a more favourable judgment than the OTS, UOB ought to be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis from 5 December 2012 onwards.

</div> UOB also sought to have the court certify costs for more than two solicitors given the complexity of the case, the number of issues and the complexity of the submissions.

</div> It argued that no more than 30% of the Plaintiff’s costs of Assessment Hearing were attributable to the Plaintiff’s claim against FCC. FCC argued that the bulk of the work done by the Plaintiff from around September 2012 to 25 April 2016 were in connection with its claim against UOB. Further, the Plaintiff could not be said to have substantially succeeded against FCC given that the damages finally awarded to the Plaintiff were much less than what was claimed. In the alternative, FCC submitted that the Plaintiff was at best entitled to attribute 15% of its total costs to FCC given its unreasonable conduct in pursuing the 3% Uplift against UOB. FCC also pointed out that the entire matter could have been settled if the Plaintiff had acted reasonably and accepted the Joint OTS served on 27 May 2016, which would have put it in a much better position than what was finally awarded by the court. FCC submitted that the court has the discretion to take the Joint OTS into account notwithstanding the fact that it was subsequently withdrawn.

In respect of UOB: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff is awarded costs on the standard basis from 31 October 2007 (the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal on liability) to 2 February 2010 (the date of the interim payment by UOB), save where costs have already been awarded by any other court. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) UOB is awarded costs on the standard basis from 3 February 2010 (the day after the interim payment) to 19 December 2012 (the end date of the 14-day period for acceptance of its first OTS).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  UOB is awarded costs on the indemnity basis from 20 December 2012 to date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In order not to prolong this long-running case, I directed the Plaintiff and UOB to try to settle amicably the amounts of costs to be worked out in the manner as stated above. In the event that they are unable to reach an agreement, they are to set out their respective proposed amounts by letter to me and I will decide the amount of costs either without a hearing or at a short hearing.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In respect of FCC, unlike UOB, it did not have the benefit of its first OTS as the amount offered there was way below the judgment amount. However, for the same reason as applicable to UOB, the Plaintiff ought to have accepted the Joint OTS. The Plaintiff and FCC were in general agreement that while the Plaintiff should have an order for costs in its favour against FCC for the nine years or so since the judgment of the Court of Appeal on liability, FCC should have an order for costs in its favour after the 14-day period for acceptance of the Joint OTS expired on 10 June 2016. The said nine years had intermittent and low intensity legal activity with costs to be assessed on the standard basis while the period after June 2016, although short in comparison to the nine years, was marked by intense legal activity, including the six days of the Assessment Hearing, and with costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis.
