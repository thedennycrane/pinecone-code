However, I declined to strike out the Defence of the AXXIS Companies in the striking out judgment (see at [115] and [116]).

The plaintiff pleaded the following causes of action, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, against the various defendants:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Cubix Group owed fiduciary duties and duties of good faith and fidelity to the plaintiff. These included the obligation to use funds that were extended by the plaintiff to C&amp;K for their intended purpose, a duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiff, and a duty not to defeat the intention and purpose of the joint venture. Cubix Group breached these duties by using and transferring funding, business, clientele, projects and staff that were intended for C&amp;K to the AXXIS Companies. Cubix Group also breached its non-competition obligations under the JV Agreement.

They breached those duties by using and diverting the funding, business, clientele, projects and staff that were intended for C&amp;K towards the AXXIS Companies. Ben and Bee are also liable to account to the plaintiff for any profits derived from such breaches. The plaintiff also claims that Ben and Bee breached s 340 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) by conducting the business of C&amp;K with the intention to defraud the plaintiff as its “sole or main creditor”. The plaintiff also claimed against Ben and Bee in dishonest assistance.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Leading up to the entering of the JV Agreement, Cubix Group, Ben and Bee fraudulently or recklessly made representations to the plaintiff, including misrepresentations that Cubix Group would match any funding contributions that the plaintiff made to C&amp;K, that any funding which the plaintiff contributed to C&amp;K would be used for the business and expenses of C&amp;K only, and that these contributions (which the plaintiff describes as “loans”) would be repayable by C&amp;K on the plaintiff’s demand.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The AXXIS Companies are in knowing receipt of any profits or benefits derived from the wrongful use of C&amp;K’s funding, and the transfer of any business, clientele, and/or staff of C&amp;K. Further, the corporate veil of AXXIS Companies should be lifted and Ben and Bee should be made jointly and severally liable for all claims by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The AXXIS Companies, Cubix Group, Ben and Bee are liable in conspiracy because they conspired together to defraud the plaintiff by causing the plaintiff to enter into the JV Agreement and to transfer the funding to C&amp;K.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As interlocutory judgment has been entered into against Ben, Bee, Cubix Group and the AXXIS Companies, liability has been established for the causes of action set out above at [5].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I agree with the plaintiff and defendants’ commonly accepted position that the defendants must be taken to have admitted to all the matters pleaded by the plaintiff in the statement of claim given that the defences of Ben, Bee, Cubix Group, and the AXXISS Companies had been struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As there was some confusion during the closing oral submissions as to the effect of this, I will briefly elaborate on this. Generally, pleadings are deemed admitted unless traversed, whether specifically or generally. A traverse may be made by way of a denial or by a statement of non-admission in the defence or reply. As the defence in this case was entirely struck out, the defendants must be taken to have admitted to all matters pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. This includes pleadings of fact in relation to the heads of loss suffered by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 During the hearing on 19 and 20 March 2019, Mr Goh made the following submissions in relation to the quantum of damages owed to the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff provided no evidence that Ben and Bee beneficially received the loans and/or sums received (defined below at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Not all the loans and sums received were made after the pleaded misrepresentations had been completely made to the plaintiff. Ben and Bee cannot be made liable for all of the loans and sums received under this cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff has not provided evidence of its other heads of losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On the day of the closing oral submissions, Mr Goh also tendered a further set of submissions in relation to Ben and Bee. He contended that the plaintiff could not rely on the striking out judgment to overcome “gaps” in its pleadings and evidence, and the pleadings were insufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s burden of proof in respect of the various heads of loss. I do not agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In this case, the plaintiff had already pleaded in its statement of claim the sums of money that were the subject of its various claims against the defendants. As these pleaded sums were taken to be admitted by the defendants, I reiterate that they could not be challenged at the AD Hearing. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to provide fresh evidence at the AD Hearing that Ben and Bee beneficially received the loans and/or sums received if this was pleaded in the statement of claim (these figures are defined below at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In its statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16.

</div> Accordingly, Ben, Bee, and the Cubix Group are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum of S$291,288.00 and US$458,000 for breach of contract and/or breach of fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiff also pleaded that the Loan Sum was transferred by the plaintiff to C&amp;K because of a fraudulent misrepresentation made by Cubix Group and/or Ben and/or Bee in their personal capacity. Although the defendants argued that some of the Loan Sum was made after the pleaded misrepresentations had been completely made to the plaintiff, it did not raise sufficient evidence of this at the AD Hearing. I therefore hold Ben, Bee, and the Cubix Group jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum of S$291,288.00 and US$458,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 To eliminate the risk of double recovery, I make it clear that the three heads of liability – breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, and fraudulent misrepresentation – are in respect of the same loss, which is represented by the Loan Sum. The collective amount recoverable by the plaintiff for these three heads of liability is therefore limited to the Loan Sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Sums Received represent, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the profits made by Ben and Bee through their breach of fiduciary duties, as well as the sum retained by the AXXIS Companies in knowing receipt. Accordingly, Ben, Bee, and the AXXIS Companies are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in the sum of US$270,000 and US$600,000, taking the lower end of the pleaded sums.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 For completeness, I also state that I do not see any merit to Mr Goh’s submission (see above at [14]) that there were “gaps” in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. The plaintiff’s statement of claim makes clear the sums of money which were the subject of its claims. These sums must be taken to be admitted by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I order the defendants to pay costs to the plaintiff on the standard basis, to be taxed unless agreed. The defendant is also ordered to pay interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 15 April 2013 to the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Dominic Chan Wai Kit and Daniel Ng Yi Ming (Characterist LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Mark Goh and Ng Boon Gan  (Vanilla Law LLC) for the third and fourth defendants;<br/>The second, sixth, seventh and eight defendants absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
