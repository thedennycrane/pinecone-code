the repayment documents. A formal agreement dated 30 December 2010 (“the 30 December 2010 Deed”) recorded Sudhir’s liability for Payments 6, 9 and 10 (amounting to US$2,272,000), with the total sum standing at US$3,250,000 (inclusive of interest). Relying on another document dated 3 March 2010, titled “List of Loans to Mr. Jaya Sudhir”, wherein Sudhir had acknowledged his indebtedness for Payments 1 to 18 above (“the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgement”), the claim was made for the other 15 payments amounting to US$3,880,000 and HK$618,000.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In addition, two other amounts were claimed, being a sum of US$500,000 paid to Rianto on or around 13 May 2010 (“the US$500,000 payment to Rianto”) and a sum of US$1,000,000 paid to Abiyoso Soetjipto (“Abiyoso”) on or around 21 May 2010 (“the US$1,000,000 payment to Abiyoso”). It was alleged that Sudhir had also agreed to be liable for these two payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In response, Sudhir disagreed with the underlying purposes for some of these payments. On various grounds, he contested the enforceability of all the repayment documents. He denied liability for the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the conclusion of the trial, I allowed the plaintiffs’ claim in the total sum of US$8,630,000 and HK$618,000, with interest and costs.

I now provide full reasons to expand on the brief reasons previously rendered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Tong is a businessman resident in Macau. Kensington is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 7 January 2008, in which Tong has a beneficial interest. Tong is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Macau Natural Gas Company Limited (“Macau Gas”), an entity incorporated in Macau on 13 December 2001. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Sudhir is a Malaysian businessman who controlled the following three companies: Firstfield Limited (“Firstfield”), Al-Rafidian and Petunia. In the conduct of his business affairs, Sudhir was assisted by a Singaporean associate, Kundadak Ramesh Kudva (“Ramesh”).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The liquefied natural gas project</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sometime in late 2006, representing Macau Gas, Tong began sourcing for a long term supply of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) for a LNG-receiving terminal in Macau.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Originally, Tong wanted to source for LNG from Malaysia. On 6 August 2007, Tong met with a Malaysian businessman, Mohamed Nazim Bin Tun Razak (“Nazim”). Nazim informed Tong that LNG was not available from Malaysia. Instead, Nazim suggested that Tong source for LNG from Indonesia. Nazim introduced Sudhir to Tong as a person with the necessary experience, capability and contacts to facilitate the process. One of Sudhir’s contacts was Anton Tjahjono (“Tjahjono”), the Chairman of the Indonesian Gas Association.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I shall refer to this planned project for the supply of LNG from Indonesia to Macau as “the LNG Project”. From sometime in August 2007 onwards, Nazim, Tjahjono and Sudhir worked to secure a LNG supply from an Indonesian state-owned entity known as Badan Pelaksana Kegiatan Usaha Hulu Minyak Dan Gas Bumi (“BPMIGAS”). BPMIGAS represented the Indonesian government in managing Indonesia’s oil and gas resources, and reported to the Minister of Energy and Resources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Meanwhile, there were ongoing negotiations for a formal agreement to be entered into by Nazim, Sudhir and their associates for the provision of consultancy services to Macau Gas. Eventually, a consultancy agreement dated 30 October 2008 was entered into between Kensington, which was incorporated for the purpose of the LNG Project, and Firstfield (“the Consultancy Agreement”).

</div>
</div>
</div> By then, Sudhir was taking the lead in the provision of the consultancy services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The key terms of the Consultancy Agreement were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under cl 3.1, Kensington engaged Firstfield as a consultant, to provide services, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>so as to procure a long-term source of LNG from BPMIGAS for the LNG Project. To this end, Firstfield was to procure the signing of a Heads of Agreement (“HOA”) followed by a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) between Macau Gas and BPMIGAS. The anticipated supply was 3,000,000 tonnes of LNG per year for the first 1½ years, and then an increased supply for the next 23½ years.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) By cl 3.2, Firstfield “shall be fully responsible for all the expenses incurred in the course of performing the [services]”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Firstfield’s compensation terms were set out in Clause 6. By cl 6.1, subject to a successful signing of the HOA and SPA, Kensington would pay Firstfield a consultancy fee of US$4,000,000. A sum of US$2,500,000 would be deposited with an escrow agent, with releases as follows: (i) US$1,000,000 as a downpayment; and (ii) US$1,500,000 upon the signing of the HOA. Another sum of US$1,500,000 would be deposited with the escrow agent no later than 90 days before the designated date of the signing of the SPA, and would be released to Firstfield upon the signing of the SPA.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) By cl 6.3, in the event of failure of the LNG Project, and if the failure were to be caused by Firstfield, Firstfield would be liable to reimburse the payments to Kensington. This obligation would not arise if Macau Gas or Kensington were to fail to comply with the requirements of BPMIGAS.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) By cl 6.2, should the LNG Project be a success, Firstfield would receive a share of the freight in the transport of the LNG at the rate of “US$0.22 per MMBTU” of LNG shipped. As one tonne of LNG is about 50 MMBTU, on the basis of a supply of 3,000,000 tonnes for 25 years, this would have meant a handsome sum of US$825,000,000 for Firstfield over the course of the project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the period from August 2008 to March 2010, the plaintiffs made Payments 1 and 2 to Hesselink, Payments 3 to 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 18 to Al-Rafidian, Payments 7 to 8 to Sudhir and Payment 17 to Rianto. Hesselink was a vehicle controlled by Nazim, while Rianto was an Indonesian associate of Sudhir who was brought on board the project in late 2009. In addition, the US$500,000 payment to Rianto took place on or around 13 May 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the end of the day, the LNG Project did not materialise. It was the plaintiffs’ position that all these payments were in relation to the LNG Project, and Sudhir had agreed to be liable for them. Sudhir, however, denied that Payments 1, 2, 12, part of Payment 13 (US$250,000 out of US$350,000) and Payment 17 were connected to the LNG Project. He had no knowledge of the US$500,000 payment to Rianto. Even for the payments related to the LNG Project, he bore no liability for them as these were paid to the Indonesian parties with the knowledge and consent of Tong.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transfer of shares in Ocean King Limited     </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I move to the other dealings between the parties. On 7 August 2009 and 11 September 2009, Kensington made two payments to Petunia and Al-Rafidian in the sums of US$1,642,000 and US$600,000 respectively. These were Payments 10 and 11. On 9 October 2009, 11,000,000 ordinary shares in a company known as Ocean King Limited (“OKL”) were transferred by Petunia to Tong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It was Tong’s case that the payments were meant as two separate loans granted to Sudhir on his requests, to further Sudhir’s venture to procure the listing of the OKL shares in the United Kingdom. Security was to be furnished by way of 6,500,000 and 4,500,000 ordinary shares in OKL respectively, to be transferred upon the listing. Sudhir had acknowledged liability for these sums of money, and the plaintiffs claimed the amounts against Sudhir. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Sudhir disputed that these payments were personal loans to him. He contended that Tong had purchased 11,000,000 shares in OKL, and paid for these by way of Payments 10 to 12 and part of Payment 13 (US$250,000 out of US$350,000). This amounted to a total sum of US$2,842,000.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Friendly loan to Cynthia Jacinto </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Tong also paid a sum of HK$10,000 to Cynthia. This was Payment 14. According to Tong, on or about 30 November 2009, Sudhir called him while he was in Hong Kong, and requested a favour from him to lend a sum of money to Cynthia, his girlfriend, who was then in Hong Kong. Given the business relationship between them, Tong agreed to do so, and arranged for an employee of his to pass the sum of money to Cynthia at her hotel. Sudhir disputed liability for the amount.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Sand Project   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On 21 May 2010, Tong furnished US$1,000,000 to Abiyoso, who was another one of Sudhir’s Indonesian associates involved in the LNG Project from late 2009. According to the plaintiffs, sometime in April 2010, Sudhir and Ramesh approached Tong about a project involving the supply of Indonesian sand to Singapore (“the Sand Project”). Ramesh asked Tong to provide an advance of US$1,000,000. In return, he would be given a share of the profits should the project come to fruition. If not, Tong would be repaid the sum of US$1,000,000, based on a security cheque furnished by Abiyoso. Tong was reluctant to do so. However, as Sudhir also agreed to be personally liable for the advance, Tong acceded to the request. Tong sought a repayment of the amount from Sudhir. Sudhir, however, denied any involvement in the Sand Project.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The repayment documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 As I stated at the outset at [2] above, a series of documents were signed by Sudhir acknowledging liability for the payments. Parties disputed the circumstances in which Sudhir signed the repayment documents. According to Tong, by early February 2010, he became worried about the huge amounts being advanced to Sudhir without any significant progress on the LNG Project. Tong began to ask Sudhir to acknowledge his liability for the amounts by way of the repayment documents. Sudhir alleged, <span class="font-italic">inter alia,</span> that he was tricked by Tong into signing the repayment documents, and that they were not meant to have any legal effect at all. I deal with the factual disputes from [73] onwards. For now, I will briefly describe the repayment documents in chronological order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 For Payment 16, a standalone loan agreement was signed dated 5 February 2010 in which Sudhir agreed to repay the loan to Tong (“the 5 February 2010 Loan Agreement”).

</div> In the document, it was acknowledged that since August 2008, a series of loans had been made to Al-Rafidian and Petunia, with Sudhir’s consent. In respect of three of the loans, being Payments 6, 9 and 10 (amounting to US$2,272,000), Al-Rafidian and Petunia agreed to repay US$3,250,000 (based on interest of 2% per month from the time of the payments until the end of December 2010) to Kensington. The repayment was to be by way of instalments of US$300,000 per month from the end of January 2011, with complete payment to be made by 30 September 2011. In other words, the instalment plan was for nine months. As for Sudhir, he personally guaranteed the instalment obligation of Al-Rafidian and Petunia. It was also stipulated that parties would endeavour to enter into further deeds to deal with remaining loan amounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Subsequently, there were two other formal agreements made on 28 February 2011 with Kensington, one involving Petunia acknowledging liability for US$1,642,000 and the other involving Al-Rafidian acknowledging liability for US$4,200,000. In these documents, Sudhir guaranteed the repayment obligations of Petunia and Al-Rafidian to Kensington. I shall refer to these collectively as “the 28 February 2011 Agreements”.

Nonetheless, the factual disagreements concerning the underlying purposes of the payments, as well as the specific defences raised, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the escrow defence and the conduit defence, formed the surrounding circumstances against which to evaluate the key issue. This was because Sudhir argued that there was no reason for him to assume liability for the payments, which then lent weight to his contention that all the repayment documents were not meant to have any legal effect.

In other words, the payments were made prior to the signing of the Consultancy Agreement. However, Tong explained that it was subsequently agreed with Sudhir that Payments 1 and 2, as well as Payment 4 of US$720,000 to Al-Rafidian, would be treated as the downpayment of US$1,000,000 under cl 6.1 of the Consultancy Agreement (see [13(c)] above).

Until around September or October 2008, Nazim was heavily involved in the negotiations leading to the Consultancy Agreement. In particular, in a draft of the agreement sent on 16 January 2008 by Haridass Ho &amp; Partners, the lawyers broadly representing Nazim, Sudhir and the service providers, to Tong’s personal assistant, Javila Chang (“Javila”), it was stipulated that the expenses for the project would be borne by the party providing the consultancy services.

The plaintiffs’ explanation on how the parties proceeded to treat Payments 1, 2 and 4 as the downpayment under the Consultancy Agreement was coherent. Tong also explained that Nazim continued to pursue an additional payment of US$450,000 less US$280,000 as discussed in the emails.

Further, on the purported appointment of Al-Rafidian as the escrow agent, there was no mention of this at all in Sudhir’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”). Sudhir appeared to have dropped the contention, as there was also no mention of the escrow defence in Sudhir’s closing submissions. As argued by the plaintiffs, there was no conceivable reason for the plaintiffs to entrust a company controlled by Sudhir to be the escrow agent.

Tong disagreed with Sudhir. However, he sent an email to Sudhir, agreeing to vary the terms of the Consultancy Agreement by paying US$500,000 upon the signing of the MOU, another US$500,000 after confirming the pricing formula, and the final US$500,000 upon confirming the quantity of the LNG supply.

Firstfield was to be responsible for its expenses. Of course, it was entitled to advances of up to US$4,000,000 based on the three milestone events. This was the consultancy fee. However, the real compensation would flow to Firstfield upon the successful completion of the project. Should the project not be successful, the advance payments would be repayable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 While Firstfield was the contracting party to the Consultancy Agreement, the parties did not seriously dispute that it was Al-Rafidian which was used by Sudhir as the vehicle to make and receive payments. Against the backdrop of the Consultancy Agreement, I found Sudhir’s claim that he was merely a “conduit” in the process, making and receiving payments with the “knowledge and consent” of Tong, unbelievable. In view of Firstfield’s clear obligation under the Consultancy Agreement to secure the LNG supply and to be responsible for the expenses in the process, there was absolutely no reason for Tong to make any payments in relation to the LNG Project through Sudhir as a “conduit”. This aspect was covered in a few brief paragraphs in Sudhir’s AEIC, and he was unable to provide details as to how and when he purportedly made payments on Tong’s behalf.

As set out at [51] above, Tong carefully explained how the project progressed, and why he agreed to certain advances being given at certain points in time in order to ensure the smooth progress of the project. I found for the plaintiffs on this factual dispute, and rejected the conduit defence in relation to these payments.

Instead, the documents supported Tong’s contention that there were two transactions, separated by an interval of over a month. Admittedly, the use of “share price” and “consideration” in the letters suggested that the transfers were by way of sale of the shares. However, there remained a degree of ambiguity as the letters did not expressly state these were sale transactions. If these were sale transactions, I would have expected parties to execute more formal sale and purchase agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 More significantly, as argued by the plaintiffs, I found it at odds with a sale and purchase transaction that there was no proper valuation of the OKL shares. Sudhir conceded that Tong was an “astute investor”. If so, there was no explicable reason why Tong would have agreed to purchase the shares at the price of US$0.26 per share without conducting a proper valuation. There was simply no evidence of how the share price was derived. In fact, the objective evidence by way of a letter from OKL to Petunia showed that the par value of the share was £0.0001 per share.

</div> This would have meant that Tong had agreed to buy the shares at a price many times above the par value. Given this context, Tong’s evidence that he was not concerned to obtain a valuation of the shares as it was merely some form of security for a personal loan to Sudhir rang true.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Even if US$0.26 were to be the purchase price per share, it was inexplicable that over a day, the share price could be randomly reduced from US$1,690,000 to US$1,642,000 for the first tranche of 6,500,000 OKL shares. Under cross-examination, Sudhir said that he did not change the price, and he did not know why it was changed. Ramesh was the one who signed off on the revised letter of 6 August 2009.

</div> Ramesh, however, stated in his AEIC that Sudhir had discussed the matter with Tong, and agreed to reduce the considerable payable for the shares. The contradiction by Ramesh undermined Sudhir’s defence.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the second tranche of 4,500,000 shares, Sudhir contended that it was meant to be sold for US$1,200,000. I noted that by 12 October 2009, Tong had only made Payments 11 and 12, being US$950,000 instead of the alleged full sum of US$1,200,000. Yet, the transfer of the 11,000,000 shares was executed on 12 October 2009,

</div> In this regard, Payment 13 was made only on 6 November 2009. If indeed this was a sale and purchase transaction, there was no reason for the transfer of all the OKL shares to Tong when there remained a fairly substantial shortfall of US$250,000 of the purchase price. Tong’s explanation that 4,500,000 OKL shares formed security for a loan amount of US$600,000 was more credible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Further, what troubled me was the fact that it was rather late in the day before Sudhir claimed that US$250,000 out of US$350,000 of Payment 13 was in relation to the purchase of the OKL shares. He shifted his stance from the initial position that Payment 18 (in the exact sum of US$250,000 but paid much later on 1 March 2010) was in relation to the OKL shares. This change came about by an amendment incorporated in the Defence, almost four years after the commencement of proceedings (and a month before the trial). This strongly indicated that by relying on a <span class="font-italic">part</span> of Payment 13 instead of the whole of Payment 18, Sudhir was merely trying to find a payment close in time to the transfer of the shares. Moreover, after the amendment was effected, Sudhir did not correct the portion of his AEIC which stated that Payment 18 (not Payment 13) was in relation to the OKL shares.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Viewed holistically, Sudhir’s case was untenable. The objective facts and circumstances (as well as the documents produced) provided support for the plaintiffs’ case. Therefore, I found that Payments 10 and 11 were personal loans to Sudhir, secured by way of the 6,500,000 and 4,500,000 OKL shares. As I have found above, Payments 12 and 13 were simply advances to Rianto in relation to the LNG Project. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Payment 14 to Cynthia was made on Sudhir’s request    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In relation to Payment 14, a sum of HK$10,000, Tong stated that this was lent to Cynthia at Sudhir’s request.

Such acknowledgements were to show Tong’s family members and business associates that the money did go towards these purposes, and that Tong played the role of a middleman only. By doing so, Tong would get more time to sort out his finances. There was no intention to create any legal obligations.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Tong disputed Sudhir’s allegations. I have set out Tong’s account of what transpired above at [51(g)]-[51(h)], which led to the signing of the February documents. To summarise, by the time a sum of US$180,000 was requested for in early February 2010, Tong was getting worried about the large advances made to Sudhir, as there appeared to be little progress on the LNG Project. He wanted some form of acknowledgment of liability on Sudhir’s part. Payment 15 of US$60,000 was paid out on 3 February 2010, while Payment 16 of US$120,000 was paid out on 8 February 2010 only after Sudhir’s acknowledgment by way of the February documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As stated in [51(i)]-[51(j)] above, Tong explained that yet again, Payments 17 and 18 were requested by Sudhir. After making Payment 17, in an email dated 27 February 2010, Sudhir had sent him an update of the progress with regards the HOA indicating that “5th to the 8th of april shud be the signing.” Therefore, Tong furnished Payment 18, and arranged for the acknowledgment of liability for the updated list of loans. Indeed, the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgment stated the date of signing of the HOA as 10 April 2010.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Having reviewed the matter, I did not accept Sudhir’s account. First, Sudhir’s account was at odds with the sequence of events. There did not appear to be any particular financial difficulty on Tong’s part. In fact, consistently, Tong had been paying out sums to Sudhir, and continued to make Payments 16 to 18 during the material time. Sudhir’s assertion that the scam began from before 5 February 2010 did not sit comfortably with this background. In contrast, it was Tong’s version that Sudhir signed the documents to confirm his liability to receive the further advances by way of Payments 16 to 18 that accorded with the context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Second, the alleged representations did not make much sense. I found it difficult to understand why Sudhir’s acknowledgment of liability would assuage Tong’s family members and business associates, just because he was known to them. Sudhir did not produce any evidence at all of his financial standing, or proffer any reason why the family members and other business associates would have such trust and confidence in him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 More significantly, Sudhir was an experienced businessman, who had, in his own words, “worked together on a number of deals relating to the Malaysia oil and gas industry”.

The documents were sent to Sudhir or Ramesh by email, and then returned by email through Ramesh duly signed by Sudhir. In other words, Sudhir had ample time to reflect on what he was being asked to undertake, and further, he had every opportunity to discuss any concerns with Ramesh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In all these circumstances, I rejected any contention that he was tricked into signing these documents on the premise that they were not intended to have any legal effect.

</div> In Sudhir’s AEIC, he claimed that he was “taken aback” by Tong’s request for an agreement to be signed “at a lawyer’s office”, with someone to be a guarantor. However, Tong showed him a copy of a letter of demand from a lawyer, and implored him to help. Tong explained that there was a great urgency to sign a formal agreement which his employee, Chen Min, would draft. Thereafter, Sudhir agreed, and he left Ramesh to deal with Chen Min. However, Sudhir insisted that the amount in the document be reduced to reflect the amount in the letter of demand only.

Thus, he recommended that “a personal loan agreement… be witnessed and signed by all parties at a lawyer’s office, with [Sudhir] as borrower and someone as guarantor.” He wanted the promise of the repayment in January 2011 to be firm.

</div> Eventually, the 30 December 2010 Deed was executed. Its terms are as set out at [24] above, with a proviso that parties would discuss the outstanding amounts which formed the subject matter of the 28 February 2011 Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having weighed the evidence, I found Sudhir’s evidence completely unbelievable. As Sudhir conceded, the 30 December 2010 Deed was a far more formal document than the earlier documents. It also contained a concrete repayment plan. There were negotiations by parties on its terms. It seemed to me extremely illogical that parties would negotiate the terms of the formal agreement, if it was only meant to be a sham. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Once again, I was not at all convinced that Sudhir, an experienced businessman, could have been tricked into signing the deed, not just on behalf of Al-Rafidian and Petunia as borrowers, but also personally as a guarantor. Again, it was not as if Sudhir did not have time to consider the consequences of his actions, and he had Ramesh to discuss the matter with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Further, the reason given by Sudhir for the emails from Tong to pursue payment and the responses by Ramesh and Sudhir to negotiate the terms of repayment was utterly contrived. Sudhir’s explanation was that from time to time, Tong would send such emails to give the semblance that he was pursuing repayment from Sudhir, and that Tong would require either Ramesh or Sudhir to respond to him to ask for time. Insofar as the replies were sent by Ramesh, they were sent on Sudhir’s instructions. Ramesh echoed such evidence.

</div> Reading the contents of the relevant emails, it was evident that Tong was seriously pursuing repayment by Sudhir. It was also evident that Sudhir and Ramesh were seriously negotiating with Tong on the terms of repayment. There would be no need to do so if Sudhir bore no liability at all. I failed to see any merit in the claim that Tong orchestrated an elaborate scam which extended to fabricating the emails negotiating repayment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Equally, I found unmeritorious Sudhir’s explanation for the UOB cheques. In his AEIC, Sudhir explained in one brief paragraph that between March 2010 to December 2010, Tong had also sought his help to provide cheques to show that he had security for repayment of the alleged loans. Sudhir recalled that several cheques were blank and/or without any dates; Tong had said that he would fill them in, as and when required.

</div> In my view, this was a completely farfetched claim. It was perplexing that Sudhir would take the risk of issuing cheques (including blank cheques) merely to help Tong maintain his charade.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I noted that by December 2010, Tong was anxious to ensure that Sudhir adhered to his repayment promises, and had put some pressure on Sudhir to do so. Tong admitted that in December 2010, he informed Sudhir that he was being chased by family members for a return of the sums of money, and also faced a lawyer’s letter of demand. In fact, the email of 17 December 2010 contained such statements: see [88] above. However, the email of 17 December 2010 did not support Sudhir’s allegation that Tong had said that the 30 December 2010 Deed would not be legally binding. As I shall expand on immediately below, I accepted that up until the signing of the 30 December 2010 Deed, Tong did not say to Sudhir that any of the repayment documents was not intended to have any legal effect. Up to this point in time, the repayment documents were not sham documents. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The 7 January 2011 Statement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 With that, I now deal with the effect of the 7 January 2011 Statement on the repayment documents.

</div> Thereafter, the document was duly signed. Ramesh corroborated his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 According to Tong, following the signing of the 30 December 2010 Deed, he continued to negotiate with Sudhir and Ramesh to sign further formal loan agreements in relation to the other outstanding sums. At a meeting in Singapore on 23 or 24 February 2011, Tong brought along two draft loan agreements. To convince Sudhir to sign them, he told Sudhir and Ramesh that he could be sued in the Macau courts by creditors, and this was because of Sudhir’s failure to repay him. He asked Sudhir to sign the further formal loan agreements so that he could at least show them to the court and to his creditors. What he said was clearly not true as he did not have any pending court matters at the time. He said it in the hope that it would spur Sudhir to sign the further formal documents. In response, Ramesh said that he wanted Tong to sign a statement confirming that he needed these loan documents to show them to the Macau court, and that Sudhir would not sign the further loan agreements unless Tong were to sign the statement. Tong then signed the 7 January 2011 Statement. Although the document was dated 7 January 2011, this was signed on or around the time of the signing of the 28 February 2011 Agreements.

</div> instead of the figure reflected in the 7 January 2011 Statement by way of the phrase “US$4.2m with [Al-Rafidian]”. It appeared to me that the amount of US$4,200,000 was only finalised by the parties after 24 February 2011. That figure was then incorporated into the agreement involving Al-Rafidian, and also found its way into the Statement. In any event, despite the difference in the parties’ cases on the date of the signing of the Statement, what was critical was Sudhir’s acceptance that the 7 January 2011 Statement was signed <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 30 December 2010 Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Thus, it was only after the 30 December 2010 Deed was signed that Tong said that he was being hounded by creditors, that he had legal problems, and that he would not use the further loan documents. While Tong explained that this was to get Sudhir to sign the further loan documents, such representations threw doubt on the validity of the 28 February 2011 Agreements. In this regard, it is not disputed that in two earlier sets of proceedings, High Court Suits Nos 842 and 844 of 2012, Kensington had relied on the 28 February 2011 Agreements to make claims against Sudhir. However, these actions have been discontinued, without prejudice to Kensington’s rights. In other words, given the 7 January 2011 Statement, the plaintiffs had chosen not to rely on the 28 February 2011 Agreements.

In my view, the evidence showed that at all times, Sudhir acknowledged his liability to the plaintiffs for the amounts, and was seriously negotiating the terms of repayment.

</div> On the face of these agreements, there was no clause with such effect in either document. In any event, as Sudhir contended, these agreements were tainted by the representations contained in the 7 January 2011 Statement. This was not seriously disputed by the plaintiffs. As I have stated above, the validity of these agreements were in doubt. As such, they would not supersede the earlier repayment documents.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Conclusion </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 By the foregoing, I rejected the sham defence.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The illegality defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I deal very quickly with the illegality defence. Essentially, this defence was premised on the very same representations relied on for the sham defence, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> that the relevant repayment documents were created purely to deceive Tong’s creditors and the Macau court, and were not intended to be legally binding. Therefore, Sudhir argued that the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgment and the 30 December 2010 Deed were void for illegality and unenforceable. As I have found, the allegations were devoid of merit. Accordingly, I rejected the illegality defence.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The illegal moneylending defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As for the illegal moneylending defence, I should highlight that this defence was raised very late in the day, about one month before the commencement of the trial. Having raised it, Sudhir appeared to have abandoned it; it was not dealt with in his closing submissions at all. In any event, I deal briefly with Sudhir’s pleaded case that if Payments 1 to 18 were indeed loans to him, they were unenforceable by virtue of the MLA as they were loans granted by an unlicensed moneylender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I note that by s 2 of the MLA, a moneylender means a person who carries on the business of moneylending. Section 3 provides that any person who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In <span class="font-italic">Subramaniam Dhanapakiam v Ghaanthimathi </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 164 at [10] and <span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) </span>Ltd [2014] 3 SLR 524 at [38], it was made clear that at common law, the test for the carrying on of a business is that of the undertaking of the relevant transactions with “some degree of system and continuity”. Where the transactions are undertaken only incidentally to the provision of other services, the requisite degree of system and continuity to constitute a “business” would generally not be established. The mere act of lending money does not fall within the prohibition of carrying on the business of moneylending under the MLA. To contravene the prohibition, the regulated activity must have system and continuity to constitute the business of moneylending. Therefore, activity which is simply incidental to the person’s core business is insufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As argued by the plaintiffs, they were not in the business of moneylending. I agreed. As established above, Payments 1 to 4 were advanced broadly pursuant to the Consultancy Agreement. Payments 5 to 9, 12 to 13, and 15 to 18 were advances provided in the course of the LNG Project. The commercial context was the LNG Project, and not a moneylending business. While Payments 10 and 11 were personal loans to Sudhir, and Payment 14 was a personal loan to Cynthia, these were on the basis of the business and personal relationship between Tong and Sudhir. There was hardly sufficient evidence to establish a system and continuity in moneylending to constitute the business of moneylending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Turning to the matter of interest, I noted that it was only in relation to Payment 16 that Tong indicated, at the time of lending, that interest would be payable. This was set out in the 5 February Loan Agreement. As for all the other advances, they were furnished <span class="font-italic">without </span>any interest element at all. In the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgment, the plaintiffs did not claim for any interest at all, even in relation to Payment 16. Subsequently, when a repayment plan was being worked out, the interest element was negotiated, and then incorporated into the 30 December 2010 Deed for Payments 6, 9 and 10. Even then, the interest rate of 2% per month from the dates of the payments to 30 December 2010 was meant to take into account a nine-month grace period granted for the repayment plan from January 2011 and to 30 September 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In my view, any presumption that the plaintiffs were moneylenders had been rebutted. It was clear that the plaintiffs were <span class="font-italic">not </span>in the business of moneylending. Accordingly, I rejected the moneylending defence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In light of all of the above, by the terms of the 30 December 2010 Deed, I found that Sudhir had agreed to be liable to pay Kensington the claim in relation to Payments 6, 9 and 10 in the sum of US$3,250,000. As for the other 15 payments, in accordance with the 3 March 2010 Acknowledgment, he had acknowledged liability to Tong in the sum of US$3,880,000 and HK$618,000, and was liable to pay these amounts to Tong.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Sudhir was liable for the US$500,000 payment to Rianto </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I go to the next part of the claim. According to Tong, in late April 2010, Rianto arranged for a meeting in Indonesia with the new Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources. During the trip, he brought up the question of his fee. Tong told Rianto that this was actually Sudhir’s responsibility, as Sudhir was the person responsible for all expenses under the Consultancy Agreement. After the trip, Sudhir asked Tong to advance a further sum of US$500,000 to keep the deal moving along. On 13 May 2010, Tong transferred the sum of US$500,000 to Rianto.

</div> There was no dispute that the Sand Project did not materialise. I found in favour of Tong for this claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 From my discussion above, it is clear that I did not find Sudhir to be a credible witness. In many aspects, his evidence was bare, vague and unsatisfactory. His case was also seriously undermined by the contemporaneous documents. Accordingly, based on what I stated in [112], [116] and [122 ] above, I granted judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in the sums of US$8,630,000 and HK$618,000, with interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the writ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Turning to the issue of costs, the plaintiffs argued for costs to be awarded to them on an indemnity basis. Relying on <span class="font-italic">Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Ptd Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 103 at [23], the plaintiffs contended that one category of cases where the court should award indemnity costs is “where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper”. On the basis of a high degree of unreasonableness in Sudhir’s conduct, the plaintiffs argued that an award of costs on an indemnity basis was warranted. Sudhir argued to the contrary.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It was not disputed that pursuant to O 59 r 5(b) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), in exercising its discretion as to costs, the court shall take into account the conduct of the parties. While I did not award costs to the plaintiffs on an indemnity basis, I certainly found aspects of Sudhir’s conduct to be relevant in fixing the quantum of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In particular, I considered to be relevant Sudhir’s absence from the trial on a few days without any good reason. On 8 May 2018, the first day of the trial, Sudhir was in Sri Lanka, and could not be contacted by his counsel. Counsel was uncertain whether Sudhir wished to proceed with the matter, and this led to an adjournment of the hearing. On the afternoon of 11 May 2018, when Sudhir was due to give evidence, he was absent. He was also absent on 15 May 2018. It transpired that he had chosen to undergo a non-emergency elective heart procedure without keeping his counsel fully informed of his intention. Such conduct resulted in a waste of trial time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I also noted that upon the request of parties, a generous period of eight weeks was granted for the filing of the closing submissions which were filed on 18 July 2018. The plaintiffs’ closing submissions comprising 180 pages dealt in detail with all the factual disputes. Meanwhile, Sudhir’s closing submissions were merely 29 pages. Thereafter, Sudhir’s counsel wrote in on 25 July 2018 to request for leave to file reply submissions. On 3 August 2018, I saw parties on the matter. Despite objections by the plaintiffs on both the request and the period of time requested for the filing of the reply submissions, I granted time for reply submissions to be filed by Sudhir by 11 September 2018. However, on the last day, Sudhir’s counsel wrote to say that no reply submissions would be filed. Sudhir had caused further delay to the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In view of Sudhir’s tardy conduct in these proceedings, I granted costs to the plaintiffs on the basis of all 11 days originally fixed for the trial. In addition, I took into account factors such as the substantial value of the claim, the factual complexities in the matter (involving a number of business deals), the multiple defences raised by Sudhir, and his shifting stance on issues in the course of these proceedings. I awarded costs fixed at $240,000. I fixed   disbursements at $73,000 (which included transcription and hearing fees, as well as other disbursements).  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Harish Kumar, Jonathan Toh and Josephine Chee (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (Mallal &amp; Namazie) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
