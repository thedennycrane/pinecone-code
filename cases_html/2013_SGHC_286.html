As a train approaches the station, the plaintiff is seen to start falling forward: stiffly, with her arms by her side. She continues falling forward face-first until she lands horizontally on the platform, still with her arms by her side. At this point, all of her body is still on the platform except for her shoulders and head, which are over the platform edge. The momentum of her fall then carries her body forward horizontally along the platform and over its edge. As her waist passes the platform edge, her legs flip over her upper body (which by this time appears to be under the platform) in a somersault-like motion. Her entire body then falls at track level with her head and torso under the platform, off the tracks and face up, but with both her shins lying across the rail closest to the platform. The lower extremities of the plaintiff’s legs are now the only part of her body which is still visible in the CCTV footage. The entire process of her falling takes at most 3 seconds. About two seconds after falling on the track, the plaintiff’s legs appear to pull back slightly and then remain still. They remain motionless for the six seconds or so which then elapse until the impact of the train.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>The CCTV footage was viewed in court in the presence of the plaintiff’s expert witness, Dr Natarajan Krishnamurthy (“Dr Krishnamurthy”).

I draw this inference because her fall began with no precursor and completely spontaneously. It was caused by no external agent. The CCTV footage shows, and I find as a fact, that she did not fall because she was pushed or jostled. Further, once her fall began, it was completely uncontrolled. Someone who begins to fall because she has lost her balance would ordinarily try immediately to regain her balance by bracing her feet or in some other way. If that proved impossible, she would ordinarily try while falling to break her fall by extending her arms. Finally, she would ordinarily show some signs of trying to get up or to get to safety after falling. The CCTV footage shows the plaintiff did none of these things. It can only be because she was not aware that she was falling or that she had fallen and unable to do so. I therefore find that the plaintiff was unconscious throughout her fall.  She regained consciousness a few seconds before the impact. By that time, it was too late for her, in her state of shock, to react.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>This finding, of course, does not determine whether the plaintiff's action succeeds or fails.  It is no longer the defendants’ case that the plaintiff was in any way at fault, whether wholly or partly, for having fallen or for the injuries she sustained. Further, on the facts, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff felt ill before she fell onto the tracks or had any warning that she was going to lose consciousness. Indeed, her evidence was that she had never fainted before

</div>. That may be self-serving evidence, but its truth is borne out by the CCTV footage. Its truth is also borne out by the defendant’s expert witness, Mr John Peter O’Grady. He is the Head of the Safety and Environment Department of the Toronto Transit Commission. He agreed in his report that based on his viewing of the CCTV footage, “all the passengers, including the plaintiff, were positioned safely on the platform prior to the approach of the train”

In addition, if it is any solace to the plaintiff and her parents, I find that there was nothing more that she could have done to protect herself from harm on 3 April 2011. The defendants’ counsel and witnesses repeated the mantra that safety is a shared responsibility. That is no doubt true as a matter of fact. It is also a theme that runs through the law of tort. But it is true at a very high level of generality. When I asked the defendants’ representatives what <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> that means for a passenger standing on a platform and waiting for a train, they had to concede that it simply means that the passenger should stand behind the yellow line and not “run about” or “do any unsafe act at the platform”

</div>.  To the extent that it is necessary, and in light of my finding at [24] above, I find that the plaintiff fully discharged her share of the “shared responsibility” for her own safety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Having dealt with these factual findings, I now turn to consider whether the defendants discharged their share of this shared responsibility. I consider first the basis of the defendants’ duty of care to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The duty of care </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Occupier’s liability subsumed under general negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>The plaintiff asserts a cause of action in general negligence as well as in occupier’s liability (see [5(a)]-[5(b)] above). For this purpose, SMRT concedes that it is an occupier of AMK Station, while the LTA maintains that it is not.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>It is, however, not necessary for me to determine whether the LTA was or was not an occupier of AMK Station. The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Private) Limited &amp; Others</span> [2013] 3 SLR 284 has swept away all of the archaic and arbitrary distinctions which underpinned the law of occupier’s liability as a head of liability in tort separate from general negligence.  After <span class="font-italic">See</span> <span class="font-italic">Toh Siew Kee</span>, the position in law (at [76]) is simply and elegantly that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">. . . as a matter of logic, the principles governing occupiers' liability are a proper subset of the general principles of the law of negligence. The law in Singapore on occupiers' liability can and should be subsumed under the tort of negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>In any event, under the old law of occupier’s liability, an occupier owed an invitee a duty only to prevent damage or injury to the invitee arising from any <span class="font-italic">unusual danger</span> on the premises which the occupier knew or ought to know of and which the invitee did not know of: <span class="font-italic">Industrial Commercial Bank v Tan Swa Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and another appeal</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 385 at [18].  The danger of falling off the unfenced platform at AMK Station onto the train tracks and being struck by a train is in no way an unusual danger. Quite the opposite: it is the most obvious danger that any invitee to AMK Station will be alive to. The plaintiff’s claim against the defendants in occupier’s liability could not have succeeded in any event.  It would, even under the old law, therefore have added nothing to her claim in general negligence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General duty of care in the tort of negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>The question I have to resolve, therefore, is whether SMRT and the LTA have a relationship with the plaintiff which gives rise to a duty of care in the general tort of negligence. Both SMRT and the LTA concede that they do owe the plaintiff a duty of care in respect of her safety when using the MRT stations and trains

</div>. This concession is undoubtedly correctly made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>The  modern test to be applied in Singapore law to determine whether a duty of care arises is set out in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”). This test comprises a threshold question of factual foreseeability, coupled with a two-stage test comprising (1) proximity and (2) policy considerations. Each aspect of the test is to be applied having regard to decided cases in analogous situations (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [73]), and therefore developed incrementally rather than radically. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Factual foreseeability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>The threshold test of factual foreseeability is not a high one. All that is needed is that it is foreseeable that the defendants’ negligence might result in persons such as the plaintiff suffering harm. This is a factual inquiry and a matter of common sense. In the present case, the danger of a passenger being struck by a train is obvious and therefore clearly foreseeable. In fact, I can go further than that: the danger was not merely foreseeable, it was actually foreseen. It is not in dispute that there had been several incidents before April 2011 where passengers had suffered death or injury in MRT stations as a result of being struck by trains.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Proximity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The concept of proximity under <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> focuses on the closeness and directness of the defendants’ relationship with the plaintiff, and inquires whether it is sufficiently proximate to give rise to a duty of care: <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">aparo Industries Plc v Dickman </span>[1989] QB 653 at 679. This concept was helpfully elaborated upon in the following passage from the decision of the Australian High Court in <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">utherland Shire Council v Heyman </span>(1985) 60 ALR 1<span class="font-italic"> </span> at 55-56, adopted in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> (at [78]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The requirement of proximity is directed to the relationship between the parties in so far as it is relevant to the allegedly negligent act or omission of the defendant and the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff. It involves the notion of nearness or closeness and embraces physical proximity (in the sense of space and time) between the person or property of the plaintiff and the person or property of the defendant, circumstantial proximity such as an overriding relationship of employer and employee or of a professional man and his client and what may (perhaps loosely) be referred to as causal proximity in the sense of the closeness or directness of the causal connection or relationship between the particular act or course of conduct and the loss or injury sustained. It may reflect an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another or reliance by one party upon such care being taken by the other in circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that reliance. Both the identity and the relative importance of the factors which are determinative of an issue of proximity are likely to vary in different categories of case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>SMRT owns and operates the mass rapid trains, hires service staff and manages AMK Station on a day-to-day basis. It controls both the day-to-day condition of AMK Station’s premises and its activity of running MRT trains through AMK Station. This clearly gives rise to a relationship of circumstantial and causal proximity between SMRT and passengers who use AMK Station. Passengers rely on SMRT to conduct its activities at AMK Station safely.

In <span class="font-italic">Simkin and ors v North Western Railway Company </span>(1888) 21 QBD 453, the court held that the defendant railway company owed a duty to passengers in operating a railway station to “provide means of access to and egress from their station reasonably safe and suited for the carrying on of the business which their Act of Parliament authorized them to carry on” (at 459). Negligence “would mean the omission by the defendants to do something which persons conducting a railway with reasonable care and caution should do” (at 456-). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Hare v British Transport Commission</span> [1956] 1 WLR 250, the  defendant Transport Commission was held liable when an unticketed plaintiff who was sending a passenger off was hit by an open carriage door as the train moved off, causing her to throw her baby onto the platform. The court held that it was “established that a duty is owed to persons allowed to be on the platform” (at 253), and that the plaintiff was entitled to assume that the doors of the carriage would be closed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>The decision of the Australian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Transport Commission of New South Wales v Perry </span>(1977) 14 ALR 273 is particularly instructive. The plaintiff passenger was waiting on a railway platform owned and occupied by the defendant transport commission. She suffered an epileptic fit and fell unconscious onto the railway tracks. She was then run over by an oncoming train. The Supreme Court of New South Wales found the train’s driver to have been negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout, in failing to notice another commuter running along the tracks and waving his suitcase in warning and in thinking the plaintiff was a large piece of brown paper on the tracks. The plaintiff’s action therefore succeeded. The High Court of Australia upheld the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Gibbs and Stephen JJ, two of the five judges, found that the appellant owed a duty of care to the respondent in general negligence arising from the defendant’s proximity to the plaintiff and from the foreseeability of injury to the plaintiff if it did not take reasonable care in conducting its operations. Stephen J opined that the running of trains at high speed, the evidence that people fell onto tracks quite often, and the fact that it was “precisely alongside station platforms that the Commission’s tracks are necessarily situated in close proximity to people congregated above those tracks, tracks which lie at their feet and from which they cannot be fenced off”, gave rise to a general duty of care for the passenger’s safety (at 300). The majority of the Australian High Court comprised Mason, Jacobs and Barwick JJ. They analysed the case on the principles of occupier’s liability.  That, of course, is no longer a separate head of liability in tort under Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>I therefore find, quite apart from any concession, that SMRT and the LTA owed the plaintiff a general duty of care in the law of negligence to ensure that she was reasonably safe while was at AMK Station. This duty arose from the foreseeability of harm to persons such as the plaintiff if due care was not taken, the well-established relationship of proximity between passengers and rail transport operators and regulatory authorities, and the lack of any policy considerations negating a duty of care.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s claim in contract </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implied term that AMK Station was reasonably safe</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>The plaintiff asserts an alternative cause of action in contract against SMRT.

The implication which the law draws from what must obviously have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either side; and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and there are many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those perils or chances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>This is commonly referred to as the “business efficacy test”. The second test, known as the “officious bystander test”, was formulated by MacKinnon LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Limited</span> [1939] 2 KB 206 (at 227): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then said: "<span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span> that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common 'Oh, of course!'"</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>Both tests are firmly established in Singapore’s case law: see <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 (“<span class="font-italic">Forefront</span>”) at [32],<span class="font-italic"> Foo Jong Peng and others v Phua Kiah Mai and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1267 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng”</span>) at [27], <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Batshita International (Pte) Ltd</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 292 at [13]-[15] and <span class="font-italic">Chai Chung Ching Chester v Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd</span> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 757 at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A term as to reasonable safety is implied on either test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span>In the present case, the defendants did not challenge the plaintiff’s assertion that she was a ticketed passenger at AMK Station. It is not clear whether the ticket was a standard ticket purchased on the day of travel or a stored value card which could be purchased in advance of travel and used repeatedly until the stored value is depleted. In either case, I accept that the plaintiff gave consideration for her journey and that a contract of carriage therefore arose between the plaintiff and SMRT. The question then is whether a term that AMK Station’s platform would be reasonably safe for the plaintiff’s use can be implied into the contract of carriage, applying either of the traditional tests for implying contract terms.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>The defendants argue that the court should be slow to imply a term into the contract where there has been no evidence of the express terms of that contract. I agree that there is no evidence of express terms of the contract of carriage between the plaintiff and SMRT. Plaintiff’s counsel adduced a document entitled “Conditions of Issue and Use for Standard Tickets”, which he claimed was obtained from SMRT’s website and represented the express terms of the plaintiff’s contract with SMRT

</div>
</div>. This is incorrect. The document is in fact from the website of Transit Link Pte Ltd (“Transit Link”).  Transit Link is a third-party contractor whose sole function is to issue tickets which can be used to travel on SMRT’s systems. Therefore, the “Conditions of Issue and Use for Standard Tickets” contained the express terms of a contract between the plaintiff and <span class="font-italic">Transit Link </span>under which the plaintiff acquired a ticket, as opposed to the express terms of any contract of carriage with <span class="font-italic">SMRT</span>. In any case, there was nothing to suggest that the plaintiff was aware of the express terms of a contract with either Transit Link or SMRT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>However, I do not accept the defendants’ argument that the absence of evidence of express terms, and the plaintiff’s ignorance of such terms, prevents a term being implied into the contract of carriage. <span class="font-italic">The Moorcock</span> concerned a similar fact situation: there was no written contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, and no clear evidence as to the express oral terms of the contract (see the first instance decision: (1888) 13 PD 157 at 159). It sufficed that the defendant wharfingers had agreed to allow the plaintiff shipowner, for consideration, to discharge his vessel at their jetty. This purpose could be achieved only if the vessel was moored to the jetty and allowed to take the ground. The court found that the business of the jetty could not be carried on except on the basis that the ground was fit for the purpose of grounding moored vessels. Both parties “must have known... that unless the ground was safe the ship would be simply buying an opportunity of danger, and that all consideration would fail unless some care had been taken to see that the ground was safe” (at 69). Further, the defendants were the only ones who, by virtue of their control over the jetty and its grounds, were able to ascertain the condition of the ground.  In the circumstances, it advanced business efficacy to imply a term into the oral contract that the ground of the jetty was fit for the purpose for which the plaintiff had contracted to use it. In the present case, the purpose of the plaintiff’s contract of carriage with SMRT was her transportation from point A to point B. There must have been an understanding between the parties that this could be done only if SMRT, having control of its stations and trains, ensured that the premises were reasonably fit for the purpose for which the plaintiff contracted to use them. Therefore, I have no doubt that under both the “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests, there was an implied term that the plaintiff be kept reasonably safe from injury while using stations and trains operated by SMRT. Had the officious bystander asked the plaintiff and SMRT whether SMRT had an obligation to make AMK Station reasonably safe for the plaintiff’s use, I have no doubt that both would have replied with a common “of course”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>That said, the term which I find is implied into the contract is simply that the SMRT’s premises would be <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> safe for the use of ticketed passengers. I cannot imply into the contract a term to the effect that ticketed passengers would be <span class="font-italic">absolutely</span> safe at AMK Station.  It is true that liability in contract is strict, rendering absence of fault irrelevant in a claim for breach of contract. But the scope of a contractual term, whether express or implied, may be contractually limited by a duty to take reasonable care. The implied term which the plaintiff argues is one such term. To show why, I return to the alternative tests for implying a term into a contract.  Neither business efficacy nor the officious bystander requires the defendants to guarantee the plaintiff’s safety and thereby become the plaintiff’s insurer for every journey she takes. It therefore follows that the question raised by the plaintiff’s claim in contract is the same question raised by her claim in tort: was AMK Station at the material time reasonably safe for the plaintiff’s reasonable use? I address this question at [71]-[91] below in dealing with the plaintiff’s claim in negligence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The standard of care</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>The standard of care in general negligence is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill.

It must be analysed in light of the nature of the specific risk that has eventuated. This in turn requires an analysis of the magnitude of the risk, the seriousness of the harm if the risk eventuates, the cost and practicability of steps to eliminate or mitigate that risk. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Walker v</span><span class="font-italic"> Northumberland County Council </span>[1995] ICR 702 at 711: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is reasonably clear from the authorities that once a duty of care has been established the standard of care required for the performance of that duty must be measured against the yardstick of reasonable conduct on the part of a person in the position of that person who owes the duty. The law does not impose upon him the duty of an insurer against all injury or damage caused by him, however unlikely or unexpected and whatever the practical difficulties of guarding against it<span class="font-italic">. It calls for no more than a reasonable response, what is reasonable being measured by the nature of the neighbourhood relationship, the magnitude of the risk of injury which was reasonably foreseeable, the seriousness of the consequence for the person to whom the duty is owed of the risk eventuating and the cost and </span><span class="font-italic">impracticability of preventing the risk.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>The relevant risk in the present case, of course, is the risk of a passenger falling from the platform onto the tracks and being struck by a train.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Magnitude of harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>I look first at the magnitude of the harm that may result from that risk eventuating. It is clearly at the extreme end of the scale. Falling onto the tracks will, in itself, cause only slight injury. But falling onto the tracks in the face of an oncoming train will almost certainly lead to death or catastrophic, life-changing personal injury. The harm is of this magnitude because of the relatively high speed at which MRT trains approach stations. The plaintiff has, of course, dropped its claim that that speed was in itself unreasonable and unsafe. But that speed taken together with other factors undoubtedly poses a danger of catastrophic harm. It remains the case that “those who engage in operations inherently dangerous must take precautions which are not required of persons engaged in the ordinary routine of daily life” (see <span class="font-italic">Glasgow Corp v Muir</span> [1943] AC 448 at 456).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Likelihood of harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>Risk is an ordinary and unavoidable incident of life. There is risk in every activity we undertake and in every activity that others undertake in our proximity, both literally and metaphorically. It is plainly not reasonable to hold those others to a standard where they are obliged to reduce the risks inherent in those activities to zero. In assessing the likelihood of harm, it is therefore necessary to consider not only the <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> of a risk materialising, but its <span class="font-italic">probability</span>. As Lord Oaksey said in <span class="font-italic">Bolton v Stone</span> [1951] 1 AC 850 (at 863):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The standard of care in the law of negligence is the standard of an ordinarily careful man, but in my opinion an ordinarily careful man does not take precautions against every foreseeable risk. He can, of course, foresee the possibility of many risks, but life would be almost impossible if he were to attempt to take precautions against every risk which he can foresee. He takes precautions against risks which are reasonably likely to happen. Many foreseeable risks are extremely unlikely to happen and cannot be guarded against except by almost complete isolation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>Lord Porter in the same case also opined that (at 858):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not enough that the event should be such as can reasonably be foreseen; the further result that injury is likely to follow must also be such as a reasonable man would contemplate, before he can be convicted of actionable negligence. Nor is the remote possibility of injury occurring enough; there must be sufficient probability to lead a reasonable man to anticipate it. The existence of some risk is an ordinary incident of life, even when all due care has been, as it must be, taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>I have already explained why the risk which injured the plaintiff was not just reasonably but obviously foreseeable (at [35] above). But the plaintiff’s repeated emphasis on the fact that the defendants knew of this risk because it had eventuated in the past was misplaced

Mr Teo was the Head of the Safety Service Department (“SSD”) in SMRT from July 2010 to July 2011. The statistics given by Mr Teo were split into two mutually exclusive categories – a track intrusion where a passenger is on the tracks at the same time as an oncoming train (“one-under incidents”), and a track intrusion where a passenger enters the track area without authorisation but with no danger of being struck by a train (“unauthorised track access incidents”).

Over those 8 years, there were 0.00834 one under incidents per million passenger trips (33/3,956,740). Over those 8 years, the total rate of all track intrusions (including both one-under incidents and unauthorised track access incidents) ranged from a high of 0.0634 per million passenger trips in 2007 to a low of 0.0095 per million passenger trips in 2011.

</div> set by the LTA. This passenger injury rate includes all passenger injuries sustained in any part of an MRT station operated by SMRT. It therefore includes injuries sustained not only from track intrusions but from other causes. It also includes injuries short of fatalities. It is not part of the plaintiff’s case that the LTA has set this injury rate unreasonably high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>Of course, in an abstract sense, even one death or catastrophic injury in the pursuit of any activity can be said to be one too many.  But we live in the real world.  To assess risk objectively rather than emotively, one must assess the number of one-under incidents in the context of the almost 4 billion passenger trips handled by SMRT over those 8 years. The probability of injury arising from a one-under incident, assessed objectively, during those 8 years was minuscule. That is no doubt cold comfort to the plaintiff and her parents. But it is objectively true.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Taking precautions to avert harm</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>The analysis thus far shows that I am assessing the defendants’ efforts to attain the requisite standard of care in the context of an obviously foreseeable but infinitesimally low risk of catastrophic harm. The plaintiff does not suggest that the magnitude of the harm made the very small risk of harm so unacceptable that the defendants ought not to have operated or authorised the operation of the MRT system at all. Indeed, that would have been an unreasonable and unarguable proposition.  Another factor to be weighed in assessing risk is the social utility of the activity in which that risk arises. It is necessary, therefore, to bear in mind that this infinitesimal risk of catastrophic harm arose in the course of the defendants’ operating and regulating a public good – namely, public transport – which carries very high social utility for a broad spectrum of society.  An injury rate of 1 per 119.90m passenger trips (the equivalent of 0.00834 injuries per million passenger trips) in a MRT system which carries high social utility will obviously bear a different significance from the same injury rate in, for example, a roller coaster ride, which carries no social utility at all beyond satisfying thrill-seekers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>I therefore consider in this light whether the defendants took reasonable precautions in operating and regulating the MRT system to avert such harm. A legitimate factor to consider in analysing the reasonableness of the defendants’ precautions is the cost of those precautions. As Mason J said in <span class="font-italic">Wyong Shire Council v Shirt </span>(1980) 146 CLR 40 (at 47-48):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>Potential precautions are infinite. Resources are finite. Looking at the issue slightly more broadly, it is legitimate at this stage of the inquiry to consider the costs of the precautions taken to avert the risk or, as is usually more important, the costs of the precautions not taken to avert the risk. I use the term costs in the sense that economists use it. In that sense, costs is a broader concept than just expense or dollars and cents. Costs are the opportunities that an economic actor forgoes by making a choice. Determining whether a defendant has taken reasonable care requires striking a reasonable balance between the posited precautions and the cost of those precautions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>The classic illustration of this balancing exercise is <span class="font-italic">Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co Pty and Another</span> [1967] AC 617. The House of Lords there found the defendant shipowners liable for discharging flammable oil into a harbour, opining that there was a real risk of the oil catching fire, and that "action to eliminate it presented no difficulty, involved no disadvantage, and required no expense" (at 643-644). Lord Reid also stated that a reasonable man may neglect a risk of small magnitude if he had a valid reason, such as that it would "involve considerable expense to eliminate the risk. He would weigh the risk against the difficulty of eliminating it" (at 642, emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>Similar reasoning is seen in<span class="font-italic"> B (A Child) v Camden LB</span><span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[2001] PIQR P9. That case concerned a young child who was trapped between uninsulated central heating pipes in the defendant local authority’s premises and suffered burns as a result. The court found that the local authority owed the plaintiff a duty of care under both statute and the common law (at [56]). The court then turned to assessing whether that duty had been breached. The plaintiff argued that the defendant did breach the duty because it failed to insulate or lag the pipes. The court considered the cost to the local authority of eliminating this risk of burns, and “weigh[ed] that evidence in the scales when assessing the extent of [the] duty of care and whether it ha[d] been breached” (at [60]). In the result, the court held that the local authority was not negligent in deciding not to insulate or lag the pipes. One of the factors the court considered was that the risk of the particular danger occurring was extremely slight, and that the local authority could also be taken to assume that the safety of young children was a shared responsibility with parents.  As the court said (at [96]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This in my judgment, is the key factor in the local authority being able to conclude that the risk is so slight, even though an injury if sustained may be serious, that they need not take the step of protecting the pipework in their properties. In addition, they could properly take into account the fact that the cost of so protecting the pipework would be very substantial indeed compared with their annual budget for heating, even if only the pipework itself as opposed to the radiators was to be protected. This is a factor which they can properly weigh in the balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>The court acknowledged that the public tolerance of risk had been reduced over the past 15 years since the occurrence of an identical incident in a case cited by the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Ryan v London Borough of Camden</span> (1982) 8 HLR 72 (“<span class="font-italic">Ryan</span>”)). The court then stated (at [88]-[91]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is clear, is that after the case of <span class="font-italic">Ryan</span> the local authority <span class="font-italic">must be taken to know that this particular danger existed</span>. In spite of the decision in their favour in that case, should they have decided that, now they knew of the danger, they should protect all the pipework in their housing stock, or at least in those properties where the heating was outside the control of the tenants?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">No evidence has been put before me as to what consideration the local authority gave to this matter. This is unsatisfactory, but not determinative of the action. I must consider what the reasonable local authority would have done in such circumstances.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In making a decision the local authority should have taken into account the magnitude of the risk, the likelihood of injury, the gravity of the consequences and the cost and practicability of overcoming the risks (see <span class="font-italic">Walker v. Northumberland County Council</span> above and <span class="font-italic">Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence</span> chapter 6, The Standard of Care).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the evidence before me I am satisfied that a local authority could properly have concluded that the risk, although it had materialised in the case of <span class="font-italic">Ryan</span>, was slight. Mr Cairns did not suggest that such accidents were common and the fact that injury is only likely to occur when someone is trapped in itself makes the risk of such accidents occurring slight.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>There are two similarities between <span class="font-italic">B (A Child) </span>and the present case which I note at this juncture and a third which I will come to shortly (see [80] below). First, the defendants clearly knew of the particular risk which caused the plaintiff’s injury because that very risk had materialised in the past. Second, that risk was extremely slight and had to be balanced against the wide-ranging cost – in the broadest sense – of taking precautions to address it across an entire system for which the defendants were responsible. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of duty</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The existing safety features</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>AMK Station had a number of existing safety features

Mr Teo explained these features.  There is a bold yellow line along the full edge of the platform which is 110 mm thick and set 635 mm from the edge of the platform. This line indicates that passengers should stand at least 745 mm back from the platform edge. There is also a row of tactile warning studs 300 mm wide installed before the yellow line along the entire length of the platform to warn passengers that they are approaching the platform edge. In addition, in 1998, SMRT installed orange nosing onto the platform edge. This serves the dual purpose of being a visible warning to passengers of the location of the platform edge, and reducing the gap between the platform edge and the berthed train from 100 mm to 75 mm

The present CCTV system is an enhancement of the original video surveillance system which existed when the MRT system was commissioned. In July 2006, the LTA installed more CCTV cameras to enable SMRT’s station personnel at the Passenger Service Centre to monitor and control crowds better and to deal more quickly with observed emergencies

These trackside signs have been modified and enhanced over the years. Signs are posted to deter suicides. They state in four languages: “Value Life. Act Responsibly”.

The only safety feature which would have addressed – and indeed eliminated – that risk is the installation of platform screen doors (“PSDs”). PSDs are a physical barrier at the platform edge with embedded sliding doors. These sliding doors remain closed at all times except when a train is stationary at the platform.

They were installed primarily to conserve energy in air-conditioning the platforms in those stations.

The defendants’ evidence was that the motivating factor was not to make the aboveground stations reasonably safe – because they were already reasonably safe without half-height PSDs – but to prevent system-wide delay and service disruption and to reduce the social cost to all commuters caused by track intrusions. The retrofit of half-height PSDs began in 2009 and finished in March 2012. The cost to the LTA of the entire retrofit was $126m. The retrofit included AMK Station.  The installation of half-height PSDs at AMK Station commenced in July 2011, just 4 months after the plaintiff was injured, and finished in December 2011.

</div>. ALARP is an acronym meaning “as low as reasonably practicable”. Safety engineers worldwide use the ALARP principle in reducing risk. It is analogous to the legal concept of a standard of care which takes into consideration the likelihood of harm, the magnitude of the harm and the cost of precautions.  The effect of Mr Mead’s evidence in engineering terms is that it is consistent with the ALARP principle to have a platform without PSDs. The effect of Mr Mead’s evidence in legal terms is that a platform which does not have PSDs installed is not, for that reason alone, a platform which is not reasonably safe.  My task is to determine whether this proposition is correct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Marginal cost and utility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>The reasonableness of the defendant’s choice of safety features – and in particular the reasonableness of the LTA’s decision to omit PSDs in aboveground stations at the time the plaintiff was injured – must be considered in light of the marginal cost and utility. It has already been seen in <span class="font-italic">B (A Child)</span> that when the risk of even serious injury, though foreseeable, is slight compared to the cost of eliminating or mitigating that risk, it can be reasonable for a defendant deliberately not to take steps to reduce or eliminate that risk. In the context of rail operators, my attention was drawn to the case of <span class="font-italic">State Rail Authority</span><span class="font-italic"> v Mayle </span>[1999] NSWCA 388. There, the plaintiff was injured when a stone thrown from outside the train broke through the window of a carriage in which she was a passenger. She sued the defendant rail authority for negligence in failing to take reasonable steps to protect passengers from injury caused by projectiles launched at trains. The plaintiff’s claim failed. It was common for stones to be thrown at trains: there was evidence that within a three-year period there had been four previous incidents of stones having gone through train windows, one of which resulted in passenger injury. But the court found that “on the statistics for total passenger journeys the risk could fairly be regarded as infinitesimal” (at [18]). The respondent also failed to show that her suggestion of fitting protective mesh screens onto the train windows was a relatively simple solution with little inconvenience or expense. At [21] the court observed that “the infinitesimal risk made questions of inconvenience and expense critical”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>The Australian case of <span class="font-italic">Cekan v Haines</span> (1990) 21 NSWLR 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Cekan</span>”) analysed particular concerns with regard to the cost-benefit analysis undertaken by public authorities. The case concerned a prisoner who suffered quadriplegia after becoming severely intoxicated while in a prison cell managed by the defendant public authority. The plaintiff argued that he belonged to a well-identified and highly vulnerable group of depressed and intoxicated persons, and that the authority owed him a duty of care while he was under their custody to keep him under constant surveillance, or ensure that the cells were fit for the purpose of his supervision. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that the authority did owe a duty of reasonable care to persons held in custody, but that duty did not require the authority to alter the physical arrangements of the prison or to re-arrange the disposition of police personnel so as to allow continuous or approximately intermittent surveillance of the prisoners. The prison in that case was a nineteenth century building and the court noted that although the costs of modifying the building were not precisely quantified, “commonsense suggests that they would have been extremely high, at least when looked at on a State-wide basis. Against such unspecified but substantial costs must be measured the duty of the State to people known to be vulnerable such as the appellant” (at 307). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>The judgments in this case make useful observations on countervailing considerations of cost and marginal utility when considering the extent of the duty of a public authority, such as the LTA, to allocate public resources to avert a known danger. Kirby J noted (at 306-307):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So far as the economic costs involved in the appellant’s case are concerned, it is appropriate to take these into account when determining what reasonable conduct on the part of State authorities required in the custody of the appellant. Obviously, the greater the cost of the modification of institutions and procedures inherited from earlier times, the less likely that the common law would impose the obligation that the modifications should be introduced, at least rapidly. This is but the corollary of the principle that the greater and more obvious the risk of injury, the heavier is the obligation to attend to it without delay... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no simple formula for the economics of providing reasonable care. Courts take economic costs into account in determining what natural justice requires of public authorities. Similarly, they must consider the costs of modifications said to have been necessary to attain to standards of reasonable care to avoid liability in negligence: cf <span class="font-italic">Johns v Release on Licence Board</span> (1987) 9 NSWLR 103 at 115. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There will need to be further detailed attention in the future to the economic theory which supports arguments about what reasonable care requires: cf <span class="font-italic">United States v Carroll Towing Co, Inc </span>159 F 2d (1947); R Posner, <span class="font-italic">Economic Analysis of Law, </span>2nd ed (1977) at 122f. <span class="font-italic">Although the resources of a State are much greater than those of any individual or corporation in it, they are nonetheless limited.

But if it was rare, then the imposition on the State, for whom the respondent is liable, of a duty to provide continuous surveillance to respond to the risk of such events occurring is not required by the standard of reasonable care. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even if precautions which the appellant urged had been adopted, it is by no means certain they would have prevented the kind of injury which the appellant suffered. It is here that the marginal utility of introducing a procedure for constant surveillance must be weighed against the marginal cost of doing so. <span class="font-italic">In a perfect world... there would be limitless funds to spend upon the modification of old prison configurations and the provision of an additional roster of police outside cell number 8 in three shift</span><span class="font-italic">s, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week. But as I have pointed out, to do this necessarily diminishes the funds available to the State to perform other beneficial functions for the community which may have a greater perceived utility. In recognition of this fact, the common law does not impose in these circumstances, an absolute duty to safeguard the prisoner. It simply requires the State to do that which is reasonable in the circumstances. </span>Having regard to the high costs of the modifications and personnel arrangements necessarily urged by the appellant and the infrequency (if not uniqueness) of the injuries which he suffered, it would not have been reasonable (at least by the standards of 1978) for Newman J to have concluded that the modifications urged by the appellant were required by law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>These observations apply to the present case. It is obviously <span class="font-italic">not</span> the case that the LTA had insufficient resources to retrofit half-height PSDs at aboveground stations, including AMK Station. The decision to commit resources for that purpose was made in 2008 and $126m was actually expended on that purpose between 2009 and 2012.  But there was evidence that competition for the allocation of public resources was clearly a consideration for the LTA in deciding whether and when to retrofit the half-height PSDs

Therefore, a defendant will be adjudged negligent even if that defendant lacks the financial resources to exercise the care deemed reasonable by the applicable standard. But equally, a defendant who exercises the care which the applicable standard deems reasonable will not be adjudged negligent simply because he has access to <span class="font-italic">additional</span> resources and is therefore able to take <span class="font-italic">additional</span> precautions. To take an example, certain cars incorporate safety features designed to minimise injury to pedestrians. Typically, those safety features make those cars more expensive. A motorist who knocks down a pedestrian will have attained the standard of care dictated by the law so long as the configuration of his car keeps a pedestrian reasonably safe in a collision.  That is so even if that motorist has the resources required to purchase a more expensive car with improved safety features which would have kept the pedestrian even safer.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analogous cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>I find it relevant to consider a number of analogous cases involving railway accidents.

He claimed damages from the defendant, arguing that the platform gap was too wide to be safe, and that there was inadequate warning and supervision to passengers on the platform. The court found that the defendant had not breached any duty to the plaintiff. It found that the curvature of the railway line made the gap inevitable, and that the gap was within international safety limits and had been passed as safe for public use by the Railway Inspector

</div>. The court went on (at [31]-[37]) to consider the various precautions taken by the defendant. These precautions are largely similar to the existing safety features at AMK Station. They include the deployment of crowd control staff at the platforms at peak hours, flashing lights at all curved platform edges to draw attention to the platform gaps, warning signs in various parts of the station, and an audio warning reminding passengers to stand behind the yellow line. With regards to the complaint of lack of crowd control staff at the material time, the court considered CCTV footage revealing that the platform had not been crowded and therefore that the absence of crowd control staff at that time had nothing to do with the occurrence of the accident (at [40]-[42]).  The court also referred to an English case, <span class="font-italic">Stracstone v London Transport Board</span>, The Times, 21 January 1966 in the <span class="font-italic">Current Law Year Book </span>(at para 8317). That case concerned a similar situation where the plaintiff had fallen through the platform gap. There was no evidence that the platform was unusually crowded at the time of the accident. It was found that the existing safety precautions, namely white lines on the platform with the words “mind the gap”, an extension of the platform at a lower level, signs which lit up when the train came in, and members of the staff shouting “mind the gap”, were sufficient to bring the platform gap to the plaintiff’s attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>There are, of course, differences between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Chan Chung Kuen</span> and <span class="font-italic">Stracstone v London Transport Board</span>. It is not the plaintiff’s case that the warnings at AMK Station were inadequate to bring the potential danger of falling into the tracks to the plaintiff’s attention. In any event, I have found that the plaintiff was injured because she suffered a sudden and unpredictable loss of consciousness, and not because she was inadequately warned about the risk of falling onto the tracks. However, these cases show that commonly-adopted safety measures which are entirely passive, such as trackside visual markers and audio and visual warnings, are meaningful and effective measures for a railway operator to take in discharge of its duty to ensure that a station is reasonably safe. One cannot argue that these measures are useless and that a MRT train station is not reasonably safe simply because it lacks a physical barrier to prevent an infinitesimally small risk.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>I find that on an objective evaluation, the safety features at AMK Station on 3 April 2011 were sufficient to keep passengers reasonably safe and to keep the risk of passengers falling into the train tracks at a level that was as low as was reasonably practicable. The incidence of one-unders remained at a constant of between two and six per year, despite the steady increase of annual passenger trips from 402,265,250 in 2004, to 587,731,687 in 2012. The plaintiff’s argument was that even one one-under incident meant that the measures taken by the defendants fell short of what was required to make AMK Station reasonably safe. I cannot accept this argument. The standard of care does not require the defendants to eliminate all risks by taking all precautions.  The standard of care requires the defendants only to reduce risk to a reasonable level by taking reasonable precautions. Objectively speaking, the existing safety features were sufficient to render an accidental one-under a minuscule risk. I find that the numbers of injuries per year either in their absolute number or as a proportion of the total passenger trips was not at such a level as to invite any inference of inherent defects in design or operation of the MRT stations.  The defendants acted reasonably in making no substantial changes to the design and operation of the stations as at the date of the plaintiff’s injury.  In particular, I find that AMK Station was reasonably safe for the plaintiff’s use on 3 April 2011 even without half-height PSDs installed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>More can always be done when it comes to safety. That is particularly so when safety is analysed with the perfect vision of hindsight. However the law does not require the defendant to take every step and to expend every conceivable resource to eliminate every risk in the name of safety. Indeed it might be a gross misallocation of resources to channel all one has to completely eliminate a risk with a very low likelihood of eventuating at the expense of addressing other risks.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Common practice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>My view is fortified by evidence that platform edge safety of the Singapore MRT system, even with only the existing safety features and without PSDs, was comparable with and even exceeded international standards and common practice. Conformity with common practice cannot, of course, be a complete answer to an allegation of breach of duty.  However, conformity with common practice is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the standard of care has been met. <span class="font-italic">Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence</span> states at para 7-38 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A court’s assessment of the standard of care appropriate in given circumstances will inevitably reflect the evidence received in the case. Where the evidence suggests that for a significant period of time a practice has been followed without untoward result, it will be regarded as a strong indication that to follow that practice is consistent with the exercise of reasonable care. It will not be conclusive, but, generally, “a defendant charged with negligence can clear [himself] if he shows that he has acted in accord with general and approved practice” (<span class="font-italic">Vancouver General Hospital v McDaniel </span>(1934) 152 LT 56 at 57). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>In <span class="font-italic">B (A Child)</span>, the court was alive to the fact that the public perception of the need for safety in premises had increased over the 15 years since the occurrence of an identical accident and given the seriousness of the resulting injury (at [85], see [69] above). Against that however, the court weighed the consideration that the insulation or lagging of central heating was not industry practice (at [97]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In addition it is proper to take into account the fact that no British Standard or Code of Practice requires that pipes be protected, nor does any British Standard or Code of Practice make that recommendation where the pipework forms part of the useful heating surface in the room. The evidence before me establishes that consideration, since the case of <span class="font-italic">Ryan</span> was decided, to safety aspects as well as to the efficiency of heating systems, has been given and yet no change been made. Again, this is not a decisive factor as there may well be negligence even where no British Standard or Code of Practice has been breached, but it remains a factor to be taken into account in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having considered the matter as a whole I conclude that the defendants have acted reasonably in not lagging or protecting the pipework.

Mr O’Grady stated in his report that the warning systems at AMK Station met or exceeded international norms for safety in most transport systems worldwide, and that it is only the newest mass transit stations being constructed worldwide which are now incorporating variations on the same safety features that MRT stations in Singapore have had for many years

</div>.  (September 2011 was the closest date to April 2011 for which information was available. If anything, the number of systems with PSDs would conceivably have been lower in April 2011 than in September 2011.) PSDs include both full-height PSDs and half-height PSDs. Many of the stations with PSDs are underground stations. Singapore was in effect the first MRT system to install PSDs in its inaugural stations in 1987. These were the full-height PSDs installed in underground stations to which I have already referred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>Further, the evidence showed that the vast majority of the 44 systems which have incorporated PSDs installed them in newly constructed lines and extension stations, rather than installing them as a retrofit to existing stations. This is the case in Tokyo, London, São Paolo and New York. For instance, London built PSDs into the extension stations of the Jubilee Line which were constructed in 1999. New York is also installing PSDs on its new line on 2nd Avenue, but has no plans to retrofit existing stations. Mr O’Grady explained that there is a difference in technology between constructing PSDs in new stations and retrofitting them onto existing stations. Retrofitting PSDs was believed to be impossible until the mid-1990s, due to structural limitations in existing stations such as the weight-bearing capacity of existing platforms

In response to my question, Mr O’Grady told me that the “tipping point” – where PSDs come to be seen as an <span class="font-italic">essential</span> safety feature rather than an  <span class="font-italic">enhanced</span> safety feature – has not been reached

</div>. This view is clearly influenced by the fact that the vast majority of systems in the world, including those of major cities, still do not have PSDs. It is highly unlikely that all of those systems are failing to attain either the ALARP standard required by safety engineers or the standard of being reasonably safe required by the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>Having said that, I accept that whether the standard of care requires the adoption of a given safety feature cannot simply be a matter of counting the number of persons subject to the same duty of care who have adopted that feature. There must always be an objective evaluation of the likelihood and magnitude of the harm sought to be averted against the cost of the feature. However, the fact that even today, such measures are not adopted in the majority of comparable rail systems worldwide is very strong evidence that the balance struck by the defendants as at 3 April 2011 is a reasonable one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">101 </span>I am guided by the case of <span class="font-italic">Thom</span><span class="font-italic">pson v Smiths Shiprepairers (North Shields) Ltd </span>[1984] QB 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Thomson”</span>). There, the defendant employers were found negligent for not providing ear-protection equipment to its employees from the time social awareness of the dangers of deafness had arisen and protective equipment become available. Lord Mustill’s guidance is useful (at 415-416):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Between the two extremes is a type of risk which is regarded at any given time (although not necessarily later) as an inescapable feature of the industry. The employer is not liable for the consequences of such risks, although subsequent changes in social awareness, or improvements in knowledge and technology, may transfer the risk into the category of those against which the employer can and should take care. It is unnecessary, and perhaps impossible, to give a comprehensive formula for identifying the line between the acceptable and the unacceptable. Nevertheless, the line does exist, and was clearly recognised in Morris v. West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. [1956] A.C. 552. The speeches in that case show, <span class="font-italic">not that one employer is exonerated simply by proving that other employers are just as negligent, but that the standard of what is negligent is influenced, although not decisively, by the practice in the industry as a whole. In my judgment, this principle applies not only where the breach of duty is said to consist of a failure to take precautions known to be available as a means of combating a known danger, but also where the omission involves an absence of initiative in seeking out knowledge of facts which are not in themselves obvious. The employer must keep up to date, but the court must be slow to blame him for not ploughing a lone furrow.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">102 </span>The court identified the key question in the following terms (at 423):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">From what date would a reasonable employer, with proper but not extraordinary solicitude for the welfare of his workers, have identified the problem of excessive noise in his yard, recognised that it was capable of solution, found a possible solution, weighed up the potential advantages and disadvantages of that solution, decided to adopt it, acquired a supply of the protectors, set in train the programme of education necessary to persuade the men and their representatives that the system was useful and not potentially deleterious, experimented with the system, and finally put it into full effect? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">103 </span>In order to determine this key date, the court reviewed in detail the history of advancements in ear-protection (at 418-419), the defendant’s contentions as to why protection was not implemented earlier (including lack of interest in parliament and amongst workers and employers (at 419-422)), as well as the evidence of <span class="font-italic">when</span> the defendants might have become aware of solutions to reduce the harm. The court concluded that the year 1963 marked the dividing line between the reasonable and unreasonable, that being the date when the defendant received a government publication on “Noise and the Worker”. After that date, the court opined that there was “no excuse for ignorance”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">104 </span>I find this a workable and logical approach to assessing when the so- called tipping point for the uptake of certain new safety measures is reached, such that it becomes negligent for a defendant to continue to expose those to whom it owes a duty of care to the risks which arise from not adopting the measure. In the present case, there is no doubt that physical barriers such as PSDs are the only completely effective way of reducing the incidence of track intrusions and the only way of eliminating accidental track intrusions.  There is also no doubt that installation of half-height PSDs as a retrofit poses huge technical and financial challenges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">105 </span>We have not reached that tipping point, whether one considers the relevant date to be April 2011 or now.  Mr O’Grady accepted that having half-height PSDs as a standard safety feature is the direction that the world’s transit systems are heading towards

</div>. But his evidence, which I accept, is that they were not yet standard in 2011 or even when he gave evidence.  It therefore does not follow that the failure to install half-height PSDs at all train stations, regardless of timing, common practice and cost, equates to a breach of the standard of reasonable care.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">106 </span>I therefore find that at the time AMK Station was built, it was reasonably safe notwithstanding the absence of PSDs. No other rail system in the world had installed them then, undoubtedly due to technological limitations of the day, and cost.  To that extent, the Singapore MRT system’s underground stations were then safer than reasonably necessary because they were built with full-height PSDs. That does not, however, mean that the aboveground stations were then less than reasonably safe. The level of track intrusions was then low. Even in 2008, the risk of one-under incidents remained infinitesimal. But technology had advanced greatly and it was now possible to retrofit half-height PSDs onto existing stations. That was done in phases and completed in 2012. Seven or eight rail systems in the world also did so. However, the vast majority of rail systems in the world continue to function without them, and choose instead to rely on other safety precautions to mitigate the incidence of track intrusion. There were, and still are, no international standards or guidelines recommending the installation of PSDs

</div>. This combination of factors leads me to conclude that the state of social awareness, tolerance for risk, technological advancement and common practice has not changed so much since AMK Station was built as to move the decision not to install half-height PSDs from the category of reasonable conduct to unreasonable conduct on the part of a MRT operator or a regulator. Therefore, the defendants did not breach their duty of care by virtue of the fact that there were no half-height PSDs installed at AMK Station in April 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">107 </span>An argument that surfaced in the course of the hearing was that the fact that the defendants took the decision in 2008 to install half-height PSDs showed that the defendants knew that AMK Station was not reasonably safe with only the existing safety features in place. As I have found that AMK Station was reasonably safe from the time it was built all the way up to April 2011 based on the extremely low incidence of accidental one-under incidents and the effectiveness of the existing safety features, I do not think that the defendants’ subjective view of the safety of AMK Station is determinative of the outcome of the case. In any case, that was not the defendants’ subjective view. The defendants’ evidence – which I accept – is that half-height PSDs were installed in aboveground MRT stations not to make those stations reasonably safe or even more than reasonably safe. Evidence was given by Mr Samuel Chan Wai, the Deputy Director of the Systems Assurance and Integration Division of the LTA. He testified that the existing safety features –  without PSDs – were considered reasonable because they were effective in keeping SMRT’s safety record far below the LTA’s standard of 0.4 passenger injuries per million passenger trips

Similarly, the evidence of Mr Mead was that the decision to install the half-height PSDs was the result of the benefits of installing half-height PSDs eventually outweighing the costs, both financial and otherwise, such as to make half-height PSDs an efficient allocation of available resources. The capital cost of retrofitting the entire MRT system with half-height PSDs was estimated at $256m

So the cost of these delays, as I mentioned, you know, whereas before it might have been 50,000 people affected, now it’s 100,000 people affected simply because the railway is becoming more and more intensely used.

I find further the additional layer of safety brought about by the subsequent installation of the half-height PSDs was an undoubted but incidental benefit of a decision made primarily for other reasons.

</div>. That meant that it was reasonably safe also without <span class="font-italic">interim</span> barriers.  I accept this argument.  The decision to install the half-height PSDs was taken in 2008. The likelihood of an accidental one-under incident was infinitesimal immediately before and immediately after the decision was taken. The magnitude of the harm was also identically catastrophic immediately before and immediately after the decision. The cost of the precautions was also the same immediately before and immediately after the decision. In other words, the risk profile of AMK Station did not change overnight simply because a decision was taken to install half-height PSDs. A station which was reasonably safe before the decision to retrofit the half-height PSDs did not cease suddenly to be reasonably safe

</div> because of that decision. Given that, there could not have been any need, by virtue of that decision alone, to install interim barriers.  I also note that it is not the plaintiff’s case that the LTA was negligent in the speed at which the retrofitting works took place between 2009 and 2012.  All of this suffices to dispose of this alternative argument advanced by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>However, even if I were to accept that some unspecified element of AMK Station’s risk profile changed in 2008 which made it necessary to at least consider installing interim platform edge barriers, I find that it was not reasonably practicable to install those barriers. I bear in mind the following considerations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">112 </span>First, installing interim barriers requires expending non-trivial financial resources. Mr O’Grady’s evidence was that those resources would be most effectively used in speeding up the installation of the half-height PSDs themselves. I accept that. But as I have said, it was no part of the plaintiff’s case that the defendants had been unreasonably slow in conducting the retrofit. Further, interim barriers have a finite lifespan in that their value is entirely lost once the half-height PSDs are completed. Mr O’Grady termed this a “wasting asset”

</div>. This goes to the question of whether such barriers would be an efficient application of the defendants’ resources at the expense of other more lasting goals. It is also the case that the marginal utility of these barriers is limited as they cannot truly eliminate accidental track intrusions in the way that permanent half-height PSDs can, as Dr Krishnamurthy himself conceded.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">113 </span>Second, there was no evidence of any practicable way of installing interim barriers. Dr Krishnamurthy proposed installing them by drilling temporary guard-rails onto the station platforms.  When cross-examined on this, Mr Mead explained that drilling was not feasible because it would damage a protective electrical membrane under the platform

Any changes to the configuration of a platform could introduce uncertainty and greater danger, particularly when one considers the vast diversity of persons who transit through the station and who might react differently to new elements

He noted that the types of temporary guard-rails proposed by Dr Krishnamurthy presented a host of potential dangers, such as the risk of someone dislodging the guardrails and causing them to fall into the tracks, of children using the rails as a “jungle gym” to swing or climb on, of someone tripping over the base of the guardrails, or of the electrical integrity of the station being compromised by fastening a metal structure to the platform

The then Minister for Transport, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, addressed a suggestion that half-height railings be erected at station platforms. She stated that the LTA’s preliminary risk assessment showed that barriers would not bring down the risk of accidents at platforms substantially. She then noted that

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are also many other safety considerations that would have to be addressed with the use of these half-height railings. For example, the barriers will need to be designed such that commuters will not sit on them and risk falling onto the tracks. Secondly, they will also have to be some distance away from the edge of the platforms to minimise the potential hazard of straying arms, inadvertently infringing onto the paths of oncoming trains. Thirdly, the space between the edge and the barriers can also become another potential hazard, if unwary passengers become trapped within the small space when the trains start to move, and this can happen to alighting passengers at crowded platforms or to passengers rushing to board a packed train. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">115 </span>With the foregoing considerations in mind, I am unable to say that the plaintiff offered evidence of any interim measure which was at all practicable and realistic. In fact, the plaintiff’s proposal for the installation of interim barriers appears to introduce elements of new risk in a system which had operated predictably and effectively in reducing the danger to the vast majority of users to infinitesimal levels. The defendants cannot be faulted for not introducing a change simply as a short term solution when that change which might expose commuters to greater danger and thereby increase rather than mitigate risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">116 </span>For these reasons, I find it was not negligent for the defendants not to have erected interim barriers pending the full installation of permanent half-height PSDs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The distance between the yellow line and the platform edge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">117 </span>Yet another argument of the plaintiff’s was that the defendants had drawn the yellow line too close to the platform edge, in a manner which was unsafe in the circumstances.

First, his assumption as to the average heights of Asians and Westerners, upon which his calculation of the yellow line distance was based, was unsubstantiated. He also had no basis to assume that the reference individual which he chose in each of the photographs was in fact of average height. Second, Dr Krishnamurthy accepted that some of the photographs showed inner-city stations and not metro stations. Inner-city stations are not suitable comparators for Singapore’s rail network, which is classified as an urban metro network

Third, there were errors in Dr Krishnamurthy’s use of the photographs—one of the photographs was wrongly labelled, certain photographs which he claimed depicted different stations were actually identical, and the yellow line distance at New York’s Grand Central Station was measured to be nearly 800 mm, which is very different from the 610mm consistently applied in the United States

I would therefore expect a yellow line distance for AMK Station of significantly less than 1000mm, though perhaps not proportionately less, to be consistent with this guidance.

Both guides in fact address this consideration in far more detail than they do the yellow line distance, indicating that platform circulation is at least as important as the yellow line distance in maintaining platform edge safety. The UK Code of Practice specifies the minimum platform width for island platforms such as AMK Station, to be 3300 mm, and the minimum distance from the edge of the platform to the nearest obstacle to be 1600 mm

This is simply because the yellow line will keep passengers further from the platform edge. But the further the yellow line is from the platform edge, the less of the platform area remains available for platform circulation. The position of the yellow line must therefore be balanced against enabling reasonable platform circulation.  Increasing the yellow line distance would not, of course, prevent intentional track intrusions, which contributed to about 87% of all track intrusions in Singapore from 1998-2008

Trains can travel at any speed between just above 0 km/h up to their maximum speed. The slower they go, the lower the risk of injury to passengers who fall unintentionally onto the tracks.

The purpose to be served, if sufficiently important, justifies the assumption of abnormal risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">132 </span>This opinion was adopted in the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Hamzah</span><span class="font-italic"> D 494 &amp; Ors v Wan Hanafi bin Wan Ali</span> [1975] 1 MLJ 203 (“<span class="font-italic">Hamzah</span><span class="font-italic"> D</span>”), where Wan Suleiman FJ, after citing Asquith J, opined that “a balance... has to be struck between the very purpose of providing this means of transport, and the negligible risk of injury which failure to take the more elaborate and costly precautions might entail”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">133 </span>Once again, I note that it is easy to say that more can be done to improve safety. This is undoubtedly true. But a balance must be struck between carrying out an activity – especially one with high social utility – with reasonable efficiency and the risks which are an unavoidable part of that activity. In my view, the speed of 55 km/h at which this particular MRT train entered the station was a reasonable speed considering the improbability of track intrusions balanced against having a mass rapid system capable of transporting the public efficiently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Crowd control at AMK Station</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">134 </span>A similar answer applies to the plaintiff’s contention that the defendants failed to provide adequate manpower to ensure proper crowd control at AMK Station at the time of the accident.  Once again, the cost of precautions must be balanced against their utility and the likelihood of harm. This very issue was discussed in <span class="font-italic">Hamzah</span><span class="font-italic"> D</span>. A claim in negligence was brought against the Malaysian Railway Administration for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent passengers on a moving train from standing near the steps of the train, when they were aware that it was common practice for passengers to alight from the train while it was still in motion, and that passengers regularly ignored the written warnings not to do so. The claimant was injured when he attempted to alight from the train before it came to a stop. The court found that the Malaysian Railway Administration was not negligent in not taking further measures such as placing a railway official at each door throughout the train to ensure passengers remained inside the train until it came to a complete stop. This conclusion was reached by balancing the cost of such a measure against the negligible risk of injury. The court noted:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case the railways provide a cheap and quick means of transport for residents of that part of the East Coast. The railway rules require that a clear passageway be kept from one end of the train to the other.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As learned counsel for the appellants submitted at the trial, the only way to ensure that no passenger stood on the gangway was to place a railway official at each door throughout the train and to manhandle and herd passengers into their coaches so as to ensure that they would remain inside between stations. In order to restrain passengers such as the respondent from dashing out of coaches for the steps while the train is moving into a station, the doors would have to remain shut until the train comes to a halt. Such additional precautions though feasible would be extravagant in both time and expense, and would defeat the purpose of providing cheap and efficient public transportation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">135 </span>In the present case, I have already found that based on the CCTV recordings, AMK Station was not in any way congested at the time of the plaintiff’s accident. The accident occurred on a Sunday morning which is not a peak hour for travel. Reasonableness does not require the defendants to provide ever increasing manpower to patrol AMK Station at all times in a bid to avert the improbable occurrence of someone falling unintentionally onto the tracks, especially if the fall was not brought about by congestion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Res ipsa loquitur</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>An argument was briefly made that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> applies in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that AMK Station was under the management of the defendants, and that her accident was one that would not happen in the ordinary course of things. Therefore, it was said, the burden shifted to the defendants to prove that they were not negligent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur </span>applies where three conditions are satisfied, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Scott v The London and St Katherine Docks Company</span> (1865) 3 H &amp; C 596:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) the occurrence is such that it would not have happened without negligence and (2) the thing that inflicted the damage was under the sole management and control of the defendant, or of someone for whom he is responsible or whom he has a right to control. If these two conditions are satisfied it follows, on a balance of probability, that the defendant, or the person for whom he is responsible, must have been negligent. There is, however, a further negative condition: (3) there must be no evidence as to why or how the occurrence took place. If there is, then appeal to <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> is inappropriate for the question of the defendant's negligence must be determined on that evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>It must be borne in mind that the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> is a rule of evidence. It operates to aid the plaintiff in establishing <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> negligence where it is not possible for him to prove precisely what was the act or omission leading to his injury. In such circumstance, the court may take the accident itself as evidence of the defendant’s failure to take reasonable care on the balance of probabilities. As stated by the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Teng Ah Kow &amp; Anor v Ho Sek Chiu &amp; Ors </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 43 (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to us settled law that the principle of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> is no more than a rule of evidence of which the essence is, as Lord Radcliffe pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Barkway v South Wales Transport Co Ltd</span> [1950] 1 All ER 392<span class="font-italic">,</span> that an event which in the ordinary course of things is more likely than not to have been caused by negligence is by itself evidence of negligence. It would then be for the defendant to rebut the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>Therefore, the doctrine operates to fill an evidential gap. It follows that where there is no evidential gap to speak of, the doctrine has no relevance, even if it can be shown that the defendant was in control of the thing which inflicted the damage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">140 </span>In the present case, the circumstances leading up to the accident are clear. The plaintiff stood behind the yellow line. The platform was not crowded. The plaintiff suffered a sudden and unpredictable loss of consciousness and fell onto the train tracks, where she was struck by a train. The court does not have to rely on inference to ascertain how the accident occurred, because this is all patent from the CCTV recordings and the evidence of the witnesses. It remains only for the court to decide whether, on these known facts, the defendants could be considered to have fallen below the applicable standard of care. The foregoing analysis (at [71]-[135] above) has addressed that question. There is no evidential gap on these facts. The evidential doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitur</span> does not assist in this inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">141 </span>Based on the foregoing analysis, I come to the conclusion that AMK Station was reasonably safe on 3 April 2011. The defendants have not fallen below the applicable standard of care and were not negligent.  This finding is also sufficient to dispose of the plaintiff’s claim based on an implied contractual term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of statutory duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">142 </span>The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were in breach of para 27 of the fifth schedule of the Building Control Regulations 2003 (Cap 29, S 666/2003) (“the Regulations”).

</div>. It was further contended that AMK Station platform is not excluded from the requirement in paragraph 27 of the fifth schedule of the Regulations because it does not fall under the exceptions provided by paragraph 28(a) and (b) of the fifth schedule of the Regulations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">144 </span>I can deal quickly with this argument by referring to paragraph 3 of the Regulations, which states as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3.  These Regulations shall apply only to building works where an application to the Commissioner of Building Control for approval of the plans of those building works under section 5(1) of the Act is made on or after 1st January 2004.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">145 </span>The design and construction of the MRT network, including AMK Station, was approved by the government in May 1982. Construction commenced in 1983. The plaintiff has at no point argued that the construction of the MRT network was done without the necessary clearances. It is therefore clear that the Regulations do not apply to the MRT network, including AMK Station, which plans received the necessary Building Control approval before 2004. The Building and Construction Authority in fact confirmed as much in its written reply to the LTA’s written enquiry of 19 August 2011. It stated that at the time of construction, the LTA’s predecessor, the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, was expressly exempted from the provisions of Part II of the Building Control Act 1973 (Act 59 of 1973) (“the 1973 Act”) by virtue of the Building Control (Exemption) Order 1983, and therefore that the present Regulations do not apply to AMK Station. The Building Control (Exemption) Order 1983 states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation established under the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation Act 1983 is hereby exempted from the provisions of Part II of the Building Control Act, 1973, in respect of the following building works undertaken by the Authority:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. All building works below ground level; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. All stations, workshops, marshalling yards, depot, stabling yards, elevated line structures, electrical substations, control centres, administration buildings and related building works on or above ground level. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">146 </span>As the Regulations do not apply to AMK Station, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the above-ground platforms at AMK Station fall under the exempted areas listed under paragraph 28(a) and (b) of the Regulations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">147 </span>The plaintiff’s injuries are undoubtedly tragic, especially for one so young. But the law of negligence awards compensation based on a defendant’s culpability, not simply because a plaintiff has suffered harm. The concept of the standard of care is a tool adopted by the law to determine whether conduct is culpable. A defendant who meets the standard of care set by the law of negligence is not at fault for a plaintiff's misfortune, however undoubtedly tragic that misfortune is.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">148 </span>I have found that AMK Station was reasonably safe at the time the plaintiff sustained her injuries. As a result, the defendants are not liable in negligence for those injuries. Neither is SMRT liable in contract for breach of the implied term which I have found in its contract of carriage with the plaintiff. The defendants are also not in breach of the Regulations as these Regulations do not cover MRT stations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">149 </span>The plaintiff’s case amounted to arguing that the defendants were negligent because they failed to make a system which was reasonably safe even more safe.
