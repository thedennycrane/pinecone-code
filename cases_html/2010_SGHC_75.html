<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the plaintiff, Power
                    Knight Pte Ltd (“Power Knight”), pursuant to s 127 of the
                    Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”) seeking,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the removal of two caveats lodged
                    by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The background to this application is not in
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant, Natural Fuel Pte Ltd
                    (“the Company”), is a private limited company whose principal
                    business activities include the sale of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels, and the
                    manufacture of petrochemical products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On or around 15 April 2008, the Company
                    entered into two Building Agreements with the Jurong Town Corporation
                    (“JTC”) in respect of two plots of land on Jurong Island, namely
                    Private Lots A2173900 and A2173901 (collectively, “the Property”).
                    Pursuant to the Building Agreements, the Company would be granted 30 year leases
                    over the Property by JTC once certain conditions were satisfied. In the interim,
                    the Company was given a licence “as if a lease had actually been
                    granted” to build and operate, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    an integrated production facility (consisting of a biodiesel production plant
                    and a glycerine production plant) on the Property. To date, JTC has not granted
                    a formal lease over the Property to the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By a convertible loan facility dated
                    24 April 2008, Power Knight granted a loan of US$20 million to Natural Fuel
                    Limited, the Company’s Australian holding company, the proceeds of which
                    were in turn advanced to the Company for the construction and maintenance of the
                    production facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As security for the loan to Natural Fuel
                    Limited, the Company executed a Debenture dated 13 May 2008 which granted
                    Power Knight, <em>inter alia</em>, a fixed charge over all
                    the Company’s interests in “any freehold or leasehold property or
                    any other interest in real property including fixtures”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 9 June 2008, the Debenture was duly
                    registered in accordance with s 131 of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”). However, for reasons best known to
                    it, Power Knight did not contemporaneously lodge a caveat in respect of the
                    Debenture at the Registry of Titles which it could have done pursuant to
                    s 115 of the LTA to notify third parties of its interest in the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In early 2009, Natural Fuel Ltd faced financial
                    difficulties, and was placed under voluntary administration in Australia on
                    9 April 2009. On 11 September 2009, Power Knight appointed Messrs Chee
                    Yoh Chuang and Lim Lee Meng as receivers and managers of the company, but
                    discharged them on 30 September 2009, appointing Messrs Ewe Pang Kooi and
                    Farooq Ahmad Mann in their stead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Meanwhile, on 28 September 2009, Rotary
                    Engineering Limited, an unsecured creditor of the Company, filed a winding up
                    application (CWU 134/2009) against the Company. A winding up order was made by
                    the High Court against the Company on 23 October 2009, and the second and
                    third defendants, Messrs Tam Chee Chong and Lim Loo Khoon (“the
                    Liquidators”), were appointed the joint and several liquidators of the
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 5 November 2009, the Liquidators
                    lodged Caveat No IB/592668D (“the Liquidators’ Caveat”) in
                    respect of the Property, claiming:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… an interest in the land, for and on behalf of the unsecured
                        creditors, of the Caveatee [the Company], who are collectively vested with
                        all the beneficial interests in the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 10 November 2009, the Liquidators, on
                    behalf of the Company, lodged Caveat No IB/598527B (“the
                    Company’s Caveat”), claiming an estate or interest in the Property
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… trustee of the interests in the land for the benefit of the
                        unsecured creditors of the company under a statutory trust arising as a
                        result of the winding up application filed on 28 September 2009…
                        and/or the winding up order dated 23 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Power Knight lodged its own caveat (Caveat No
                    IB/601038K) as holder of a fixed charge over the Property on 11 November
                    2009, and commenced this action to demand that the Liquidators and the Company
                    show cause why their respective caveats should not be removed pursuant to
                    s 127 of the LTA. It should be noted that it is accepted by Power Knight
                    that because the Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats were lodged
                    before Power Knight’s caveat they would, if they protect valid interests
                    in land, have priority to Power Knight’s caveat (see ss 48 and 49 of
                    the LTA).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Liquidators’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for the Liquidators relies primarily
                    on the authority of <em>Ng Wei Teck Michael and others v
                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 778
                        (“<em>Michael Ng</em>”), a decision of
                    the Court of Appeal, as establishing that, upon the winding up of a company, a
                    statutory trust arises to preserve the assets of the company for <em>pari passu</em> distribution among the unsecured creditors,
                    who are in the nature of a <em>cestui que trust</em> with
                    beneficial interests extending to all of the company’s property.
                    Consequently, the unsecured creditors of the Company had the necessary
                    “interest in land” for the purpose of lodging a caveat under
                    s 115 of the LTA in respect of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Liquidators also contend that, on the
                    authority of <em>Michael Ng</em>, the subject matter of the
                    statutory trust includes a company’s encumbered assets, such as assets
                    subject to a security interest which predates the winding up of the company, and
                    therefore Power Knight’s fixed charge does not preclude the
                    Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Power Knight’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Power Knight counters that the unsecured
                    creditors of the Company have no caveatable interest, and that therefore the
                    Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats should be removed, on the basis
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the concept of the statutory trust
                        has been criticised, particularly by the High Court of
                    Australia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        statutory trust which arises upon the winding up of a company does not
                        confer beneficial or proprietary interests of any kind on
                    anyone;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        statutory trust cannot encompass pre-existing encumbered assets, such as the
                        Property, which do not form part of the pool of assets available for
                        distribution among unsecured creditors; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>Michael Ng</em> was
                        concerned with a different situation and therefore is distinguishable from
                        the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The issues that therefore arise for my
                    determination are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether a statutory trust came into
                        being upon the winding up of the Company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     if so, what are the interests (if any) of the
                        Company’s unsecured creditors under the statutory trust, and whether
                        they qualify as an “interest in land” under s 115 of the
                        LTA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
                        the Property fell within the ambit of the statutory trust, which encompasses
                        assets available for distribution to the Company’s unsecured
                        creditors, notwithstanding the fixed charge granted to Power
                    Knight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I will, however, begin with issue (c), because
                    if the Property does not fall within the Company’s general pool of assets,
                    it will, on orthodox principles of insolvency law, not be available for
                    distribution to the unsecured creditors by the Liquidators, and cannot therefore
                    be included in the statutory trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There is one other matter which, though not
                    addressed by either party, raises an issue of some importance, and that is
                    whether either the Liquidators or the Company had <em>locus
                        standi</em> to lodge the respective caveats for the benefit of the
                    unsecured creditors. Section 115 of the LTA states that a caveat may be
                    lodged, <em>inter alia</em>, by “[a]ny person
                    claiming an interest in land”, and it is not apparent to me what interest
                    is being claimed by the Liquidators or the Company if the beneficial interest in
                    the Property resides with the unsecured creditors of the Company, as the
                    Liquidators contend. Nonetheless, as I have not heard submissions on this point,
                    I express no concluded view on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Property Was Available for Distribution to the Unsecured
                Creditors notwithstanding Power Knight’s Interest</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Power Knight’s interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The nature of Power Knight’s interest in
                    the Property must be determined from the Building Agreements and the Debenture.
                    Although JTC never granted the Company a lease under the Building Agreements, an
                    agreement for a lease creates an equitable lease: <em>Golden
                        Village Multiplex Pte Ltd v Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 169 (per LP Thean JA at [12] and [15]). Under the terms
                    of the Debenture, the Company charged its equitable leasehold interest to Power
                    Knight as security, and this security interest was perfected when Power Knight
                    registered the Debenture under s 131 of the CA on 9 June 2008. The
                    material portion of s 131 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Registration of
                        charges</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>131</b>. – (1) Subject to this Division,
                        where a charge to which this section applies is created by a company there
                        shall be lodged with the Registrar for registration, within 30 days after
                        the creation of the charge, a statement containing the prescribed
                        particulars of the charge, and if this section is not complied with in
                        relation to the charge the charge shall, so far as any security on the
                        company’s property or undertaking is thereby conferred, be void
                        against the liquidator and any creditor of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Under s 131(3)(<em>e</em>), a charge to which s 131(1) applies includes “a
                    charge on land wherever situate or any interest therein”. As a result of
                    registration, Power Knight obtained a security interest which would, ordinarily,
                    be binding on the Company, the Liquidators, and any creditor of the
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     There was some dispute as to the nature of
                    Power Knight’s security interest, with counsel for the Liquidators
                    characterising it as a fixed charge while counsel for Power Knight described it
                    as more akin to an equitable mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This is a vexed issue, as the terms
                    “charge” and “mortgage” have often been used
                    interchangeably: see <em>Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and
                        Security</em> (Louise Gullifer ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) (“<em>Goode</em>”), paras 1-51 – 1-52. Whether the
                    Debenture gave rise to a charge or mortgage depends on the intention of the
                    parties as objectively ascertained: <em>Swiss Bank Corporation v
                        Lloyds Bank Ltd and others</em> [1982] AC 584 (per
                    Buckley LJ at 595). It is clear from the Debenture that Power Knight could
                    appoint receivers and managers, who were vested with extensive powers to manage,
                    enter into possession and assume control of, as well as sell, the Property.
                    Under the terms of the Debenture, Power Knight could itself exercise any of
                    these rights, regardless of whether receivers and managers had been
                    appointed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     One of the distinctions between a charge and
                    an equitable mortgage is that the chargee is not entitled to avail himself of
                    the self-help remedies of sale, possession or appointment of a receiver (though
                    he may apply to the court for one of these remedies): <em>Goode</em>, para 1-51 (note 184), <em>Fisher and
                        Lightwood’s Law of Mortgage</em> (Wayne Clark ed) (LexisNexis
                    Butterworths, 12<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006), para 6.1 and
                    6.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Given that the parties intended that Power
                    Knight should have all the remedies available to a mortgagee, I am inclined to
                    regard Power Knight’s security interest as an equitable
                mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Nonetheless, I do not think that the technical
                    distinctions between an equitable mortgage and an equitable charge make a
                    difference to the issues in this case. Since a mortgage is a broader security
                    and often includes a charge (see <em>Goode</em>,
                    para 1-52), for convenience, I have referred, and will continue to refer,
                    to Power Knight’s interest as a “fixed
                charge”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are secured assets available for distribution among unsecured
                creditors?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The distinction between a charge and a
                    mortgage is immaterial in this case because both types of security interest
                    clearly confer equitable property rights in the Property on Power Knight and
                    make it a secured creditor. One of the defining characteristics of a secured
                    creditor is that, on the debtor’s insolvency, he is able to directly
                    realise his security independently of the normal liquidation process. As Goode,
                        <em>Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2005) (“<em>Principles</em>”) notes (at para 3-04):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, a creditor holding a security interest or other real right is
                        unaffected by winding-up and may proceed to realise his security or assert
                        other rights of property as if the company were not in liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This point is repeated by other learned commentators in the field of
                    insolvency law (see <em>Goode</em>, para 1-71, and
                    Keay, <em>McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>McPherson</em>”),
                    para 11.003), and must be correct in principle, for the entire <em>raison d’être</em> of taking security is to ensure that
                    the secured asset will not fall into the debtor’s general pool of assets
                    and will therefore be unavailable to the unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The rule that upon liquidation only a
                    company’s unencumbered or free assets are available for distribution among
                    its unsecured creditors has a long and distinguished pedigree. It was repeatedly
                    emphasised by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Re
                        Regent’s Canal Ironworks Co, ex parte Grissell</em> (1875)
                    3 Ch D 411 (per James LJ at 427), <em>Re
                        David Lloyd &amp; Co</em> (1877) 6 Ch D 339 (per
                    James LJ at 344 – 345) and <em>Re Pyle Works (No.
                        1)</em> (1890) LR 44 Ch D 534 (per
                    Cotton LJ at 577 – 578), and was reaffirmed by the House of Lords in
                        <em>Buchler v Talbot</em> [2004] 2 AC 298,
                    where Lord Millet said at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bankruptcy and companies liquidation are concerned with the realisation
                        and distribution of the insolvent’s <em>free
                            assets</em> among the unsecured creditors. <em>They
                            are not concerned with assets which have been charged to creditors as
                            security, whether by way of fixed or floating charge. Secured creditors
                            can resort to their security for the discharge of their debts outside
                            the bankruptcy or winding up</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The actual decision in <em>Buchler v Talbot</em> (that expenses properly incurred by the
                    liquidator of an insolvent company are not payable out of assets subject to a
                    floating charge) was statutorily reversed by s 1282 of the UK’s
                    Companies Act 2006 (c 46), and does not apply in Singapore by virtue of
                    ss 328(1) and 328(5) of the CA, which provide that such expenses have
                    priority over the claims of holders of a floating charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Nonetheless, the force of the reasoning
                    employed by their Lordships in <em>Buchler v Talbot</em>
                    (which in fact applies <em>a fortiori</em> to assets
                    subject to a fixed charge) is not diminished, and the statutory provisions
                    demonstrate that <em>but for</em> legislative intervention,
                    the common law position is that upon a winding up, secured assets are not
                    available for distribution by the liquidator among the company’s unsecured
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Consequently, even if, as the Liquidators
                    contend, a statutory trust arose on the winding up of the Company for the
                    benefit of the unsecured creditors, in my judgment, the subject matter of such a
                    trust could not include the Property, which was already validly encumbered by
                    Power Knight’s fixed charge and therefore unavailable to the unsecured
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This view is strengthened by Lord
                    Hoffmann’s statement in <em>Buchler v Talbot</em> at
                    [28] that “the [statutory] trust applies only to the company’s
                    property. It does not affect the proprietary interests of others.” A
                    similar conclusion is expressed by Lord Brightman in <em>Roberts
                        Petroleum Ltd v Bernard Kenny Ltd</em> [1983] 2 AC 192 at
                    208 where he states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the statutory duty of the liquidator in [a winding up] is to
                        collect the assets of the company and to apply them in discharge of its
                        liabilities…
                        <em>The assets which the liquidator is able to collect and
                            distribute are however necessarily those which are free from a
                            charge</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Counsel for the Liquidators submits, however,
                    that <em>Michael Ng</em> establishes that on a winding up,
                    unsecured creditors obtain a beneficial interest in a company’s property,
                        <em>including</em> its encumbered assets. It is
                    therefore necessary to examine <em>Michael Ng</em> in
                    detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Michael Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The facts in <em>Michael
                        Ng</em> were essentially the obverse of this case. A company had
                    granted an equitable mortgage over registered land to the respondent
                    (“OCBC”). OCBC lodged a caveat claiming an interest as equitable
                    mortgagee in respect of the land but did not register the equitable mortgage
                    under s 131 of the CA. OCBC enforced the equitable mortgage and obtained a
                    court order authorising it to sell the land, but on 6 May 1994, before it
                    could do so, the second appellants (the unsecured creditors) presented a winding
                    up application. The winding-up proceedings took some time and on 13 April
                    1995 OCBC sold the land. The winding-up order was eventually made on 5 May
                    1995 and the first appellants were appointed liquidators of the company. The
                    appellants then sought to claim that the equitable mortgage was void for want of
                    registration under s 131, and that the proceeds of the sale of the land
                    should be paid over to the first appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Court of Appeal was concerned with two
                    issues. First, whether the equitable mortgage was void against the first
                    appellants <em>qua</em> liquidators of the company; and
                    second, whether the equitable mortgage was void against the second appellants
                        <em>qua</em> unsecured creditors of the company. The
                    Court of Appeal decided the first issue against the liquidators, and that
                    portion of the judgment is not material to this case. However, the Court of
                    Appeal held that, as regards the second appellants <em>qua</em> unsecured creditors, the equitable mortgage was
                void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     LP Thean JA, on behalf of the Court of
                    Appeal, held that the reference to “any creditor” in s 131 of
                    the CA did not include an unsecured creditor while the company was a going
                    concern, as such a creditor had no interest in the company’s property. It
                    was only upon the presentation of a winding up petition that a statutory trust
                    came into being for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, who thereby obtained
                    a beneficial interest in the assets of the company, and could therefore be
                    considered a “creditor” in the sense of s 131 of the
                    CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The key portion of the judgment, upon which
                    counsel for the Liquidators relies, is at [31], where LP Thean JA
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… On the basis of all the authorities which we have discussed,
                        s 131(1) of the Companies Act does not apply in favour of an unsecured
                        creditor and an unregistered charge is not void as against such a creditor,
                        while the company is a going concern. This is because he is not entitled to
                        prevent the company from paying off the debt secured by the unregistered
                        charge or granting a confirmatory charge. An unsecured creditor has no
                        interest in the assets of a company and is powerless to restrain it from
                        dealing with its assets as it wishes. This state of affairs which prevails
                        while the company is a going concern ceases on the presentation of a
                        winding-up petition. As from that date, the company is no longer at liberty
                        to pay off the debt owed or grant a confirmatory charge to the chargee.
                        Under s 259 read together with s 255(2) of the Companies Act, any
                        disposition of the company’s property from the presentation of the
                        winding-up petition is void unless it is sanctioned by the court. A
                        statutory scheme comes into place to preserve the assets of the company for
                            <em>pari passu</em> distribution among the
                        unsecured creditors: see, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        ss 258, 259, 260, 334 of the Companies Act; and the unsecured creditors
                        of a company are in the nature of a <em>cestui que
                            trust</em> with beneficial interests extending to all the
                        company’s property, including the subject matter of the unregistered
                        charge. The avoidance of the unregistered charge would, after all, free the
                        subject matter of the charge to swell the assets of the company for the
                        benefit of the unsecured creditors. In our judgment, on the presentation of
                        a winding-up petition, an unsecured creditor acquires sufficient interest in
                        the subject matter of the unregistered charge so as to qualify as a
                        “creditor” for the purposes of s 131(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Counsel for the Liquidator contends that,
                    since the registration requirement under s 131 of the CA is required only
                    to perfect the charge <em>vis-à-vis</em> other creditors
                    (see <em>Goode</em>, para 2-22), the unregistered
                    charge in <em>Michael Ng</em> was valid and enforceable as
                    against the company, and since, according to LP Thean JA, an unsecured creditor
                    must have an interest in the company’s property before he can rely on
                    s 131, the second appellants in <em>Michael Ng</em>
                    must, on the presentation of the winding up have, had an interest in the land
                    subject to the unregistered charge in order to invoke s 131 and avoid the
                    charge. Therefore, <em>Michael Ng</em> demonstrates that
                    encumbered assets are caught by the statutory trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This argument is ingenious but it is not, in
                    my judgment, correct. I do not read <em>Michael Ng</em> as
                    contradicting the well-established position (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> to <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) that
                    unsecured creditors, on a winding up, have no recourse to the debtor’s
                    secured assets. In my opinion, what <em>Michael Ng</em>
                    decides is that an unsecured creditor only has <em>locus
                        standi</em> to invoke s 131 of the CA when a winding up petition
                    is presented, as it is only from that date that he becomes interested in the
                    property of the company, which will, once s 131 is relied upon, include the
                    subject matter of the unregistered charge. The sequence of events therefore runs
                    as follows: upon the presentation of a winding up petition, the unsecured
                    creditors obtain a beneficial interest in the unencumbered property of the
                    company. By virtue of that interest, an unsecured creditor obtains <em>locus standi</em> to invoke s 131 to avoid the
                    unregistered charge, and the charged property is then freed from the charge,
                    falling into the general pool of assets which is to be distributed among the
                    unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This reading is confirmed by LP
                    Thean JA’s statement that “[t]he avoidance of the unregistered
                    charge would, after all, free the subject matter of the charge to swell the
                    assets of the company for the benefit of the unsecured
                creditors.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Consequently, in this respect, the Liquidators
                    derive no benefit from <em>Michael Ng</em>, which was
                    concerned with whether an unsecured creditor had, upon the presentation of a
                    winding up petition, standing to avoid an unregistered charge under s 131
                    of the CA. <em>Michael Ng</em> does not support the
                    contention that an unsecured creditor, in and by virtue of a winding up, has a
                    beneficial interest in property subject to a <em>registered</em> charge. That this cannot be the case is implicit in
                    LP Thean JA’s statement at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>
                    above: where a charge has been validly registered under s 131 of the CA (as
                    in this case) and cannot be avoided, the subject matter of the charge is
                        <em>not</em> freed “to swell the assets of the
                    company for the benefit of the unsecured creditors”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Therefore, I conclude that the unsecured
                    creditors of the Company have no interest in the Property, the equitable
                    leasehold interest in which has been validly charged to Power Knight. It follows
                    that they do not claim “an interest in land” for the purposes of
                    lodging a caveat under s 115 of the LTA, and the Liquidators’ Caveat
                    and the Company’s Caveat must be removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     That is sufficient to dispose of this case,
                    but as counsel have submitted full arguments on the remaining issues, and it is
                    likely that this judgment will be appealed, I will set out my views on the first
                    two issues I alluded to in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Statutory Trust</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Existence of the statutory trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Although counsel for Power Knight pointed out
                    that the statutory trust is not recognised in Australia after the High Court of
                    Australia’s decision in <em>Commissioner of Taxation of the
                        Commonwealth of Australia v Linter Textiles Australia Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> (2005) 220 CLR 592 (“<em>Linter Textiles</em>”), in my opinion this issue has
                    clearly been decided in Singapore by <em>Michael
                    Ng</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Although not referred to in <em>Michael Ng</em>, the leading modern authority on the statutory trust
                    is <em>Ayerst (Inspector of Taxes) v C &amp; K (Construction)
                        Ltd</em> [1976] AC 167 (“<em>Ayerst</em>”), a decision of the House of Lords. There, Lord
                    Diplock confirmed the existence of the statutory trust on the basis that upon
                    the making of a winding up order, by operation of the relevant provisions of the
                    CA, a company loses all custody and control of its property, and all powers of
                    dealing with the company’s assets are transferred to a liquidator who is
                    to act in accordance with the statutory scheme set out in the CA. Consequently,
                    Lord Diplock held, by operation of statute, upon the making of a winding up
                    order, a statutory trust comes into effect because the company, despite
                    remaining legal owner of its property, loses all beneficial ownership to
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As is clear from the judgment of LP
                    Thean JA quoted in <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above, the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Michael Ng</em> endorsed the concept
                    of a statutory trust for essentially the same reasons as those given by Lord
                    Diplock in <em>Ayerst</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Although it is occasionally suggested that
                        <em>Ayerst</em> only decided that a company was
                    divested of “beneficial ownership” of its assets for the purposes
                    of interpreting a specific provision of the UK’s Finance Act 1954 (c 44)
                    (see, for example, <em>Low Gim Har v Low Gim Siah</em>
                    [1992] 1 SLR(R) 970, per Chan Sek Keong J at [23] – [26]),
                    I do not, with respect, think it is possible to limit <em>Ayerst</em> in this manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, Lord Diplock himself in <em>Ayerst</em>, at 179 – 181, relied on and endorsed
                    earlier authorities (which predated the earliest Finance Act) which had
                    recognised the existence of the statutory trust as a matter of common law.
                    Second, <em>Ayerst</em> has been repeatedly cited as
                    establishing, without qualification, that upon the winding up of a company, a
                    statutory trust is established over the company’s assets: <em>Buchler v Talbot</em> (per Lord Hoffmann at [28]), <em>Wight v Eckhardt Marine GmbH</em> [2004] 1 AC 147
                    (per Lord Hoffmann at [22]) and <em>Cambridge Gas Transport Corp
                        v Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Navigator Holdings
                        Plc</em> [2007] 1 AC 508 (per Lord Hoffmann at [14]).
                    Finally, exactly the same criticism may be employed against other landmark cases
                    which, while ostensibly concerned with interpreting specific points of revenue
                    law, have always been taken as representing the common law: for example,
                        <em>Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan
                        Livingston</em> [1965] 1 AC 694 (“<em>Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Livingston</em>”) and <em>McPhail and others v Doulton and others</em> [1971]
                    1 AC 424.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of the statutory trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Notwithstanding the long line of authorities
                    recognising the existence of the statutory trust, its exact nature has been a
                    matter of some controversy. Although it is sometimes said that the statutory
                    trust is created “in favour of” the general body of unsecured
                    creditors (see <em>Re Yagerphone Ltd</em>
                    [1935] Ch 392 at 396 and <em>Re Anglo-Oriental Carpet
                        Manufacturing Company</em> [1903] 1 Ch 914 at 918), the
                    prevailing view is stated in <em>Principles</em>,
                    para 3-08 (see also <em>McPherson</em>,
                    para 7.006):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Seventh principle: no creditor has
                            any interest</b>
<b><em>in specie</em></b>
<b>in the company’s assets or
                        realisations</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The statutory trust upon which the company in winding up holds the assets
                        and realisations is not of a kind which confers on the creditors beneficial
                        co-ownership or, indeed, a proprietary interest of any kind. Their rights
                        are limited to invoking the protection of the court to ensure that the
                        liquidator fulfils his statutory duties. Their position is analogous to that
                        of residuary legatees in an unadministered estate. They have a right to
                        compel performance of the executor’s duties but no interest in the
                        assets comprising the estate until completion of the administration, during
                        which time beneficial ownership of the assets is in suspense. The company
                        thus holds the assets for statutory purposes, not for persons
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I should point out, however, that the analogy
                    to a residuary legatee was one of the considerations that prompted the High
                    Court of Australia in <em>Linter Textiles</em> to hold that
                    the statutory trust did not exist. In the case of an unadministered estate, it
                    cannot be said until administration is complete what the residue will consist of
                    or what its value will be, and so the requisite certainty of subject-matter for
                    the existence of a trust is lacking. Consequently, the executor of an
                    unadministered estate is not a trustee, but holds the legal and beneficial title
                    to the testator’s property in full right: <em>Commissioner
                        of Stamp Duties v Livingston</em>. The High Court of Australia in
                        <em>Linter Textiles</em> therefore preferred the view
                    that upon winding up, a company remains full legal and beneficial owner of its
                    property, but is statutorily disabled from enjoying that ownership. This view is
                    attractive, as the analogy between the two situations is compelling: in neither
                    administration nor liquidation can it be ascertained, until the exercise is
                    completed, what residual assets (if any) are to be distributed to the residuary
                    legatee or unsecured creditor. It might therefore not be appropriate to speak of
                    a “trust” at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Nonetheless, although Lord Diplock was clearly
                    aware of this point (see <em>Ayerst</em> at 176), he
                    confirmed the concept of the statutory trust, pointing out that the word
                    “statutory” indicated that “the trust does not bear all the
                    indicia which characterise a trust as it was recognised by the Court of Chancery
                    apart from statute”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Therefore, on this view, the “statutory
                    trust” is a purpose trust, with the beneficial interest “in
                    suspense”. The company holds the legal title to its property on trust for
                    the purposes of the statutory scheme administered by the liquidator. Since this
                    scheme is intended to be for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, it may
                    loosely be said that the statutory trust is “in favour of” the
                    unsecured creditors. However, this is a misleading use of language, for it then
                    becomes natural to regard the unsecured creditors as ordinary beneficiaries
                    having beneficial interests in the company’s assets, when in fact, during
                    the course of the winding up, they have only a hope of obtaining such interests.
                    In principle, therefore, I agree with the view that, notwithstanding that the
                    making of a winding up order brings into existence a statutory trust, unsecured
                    creditors have no proprietary interests in a company’s property: <em>Mitchell v Carter</em> [1997] 1 BCLC 681 (per
                    Millett LJ at 686), <em>Re Calgary and Edmonton Land Co Ltd
                        (in liquidation)</em> [1975] 1 WLR 355 (per Megarry J
                    at 359), <em>Re A Caveat, ex parte The Canowie Pastoral Company
                        Limited</em> [1931] SASR 502 (per Angas Parsons J at
                    505), <em>Ayerst, Bulcher v Talbot</em> (per Lord Hoffmann
                    at [28]), and <em>Commissioner of Stamp Duties v
                        Livingston</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It follows that I respectfully disagree with
                    the statement by the Court of Appeal in [31] of <em>Michael
                        Ng</em> that, as from the presentation of a winding up petition,
                    “the unsecured creditors of a company are in the nature of a <em>cestui que trust</em> with beneficial interests extending to
                    all the company’s property”. Apart from its inconsistency with the
                    nature of the statutory trust, there are difficulties in making, as <em>Michael Ng</em> does, the date of presentation of a winding
                    up petition (as opposed to the date of the winding up order) the operative date
                    from which the statutory trust commences: see Lee, “Unsecured Creditor
                    Versus Unregistered Charge” (1998) 10 SAcLJ 241 at p
                    244.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, as I am bound by the authority of
                        <em>Michael Ng</em>, it is not open to me to hold that
                    the unsecured creditors have no beneficial interests in the assets of the
                    Company which are within the ambit of the statutory trust. As I have already
                    decided (at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above), however, that these assets do not
                    include the Property, which has been validly charged to Power Knight, whatever
                    beneficial interests the unsecured creditors may have in the Company’s
                    assets do not include an “interest in land” for the purposes of
                    lodging a caveat under s 115 of the LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For the foregoing reasons, I grant Power
                    Knight’s application and order that the Liquidators’ Caveat and the
                    Company’s Caveat be removed. I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
