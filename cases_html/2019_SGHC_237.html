In the ordinary course, the determinative factor in this assessment is whether the proceeds of sale are sufficient to satisfy the mortgagee’s interest in the immovable property.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I agreed with Ms Tee’s submissions. An execution creditor attempting to effect the sale of mortgaged immovable property that has been seized should generally seek the mortgagee’s consent first, in line with para 80(1)(c) of the Practice Directions and absent good reasons for doing otherwise. As Ms Tee articulated, this requirement ensures that the mortgagee is given the option to exercise any available power of sale, thereby avoiding the potential scenario where a mortgagee and execution creditor seek to simultaneously exercise their powers of sale, as occurred in <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Chia Kin Tuck </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 322 (“<span class="font-italic">Chia Kin Tuck</span>”). No prejudice is suffered by the execution creditor, who would be entitled only to the surplus sale proceeds in the event that a mortgagee exercises his power of sale: see s 74(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”).

The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Peter Low </span>stated at [114(b)] that “a sale [of immovable property financed by mortgage loans] under a [writ of seizure and sale] is not possible without the mortgagees’ consent”.

This includes the court’s power to direct the sale of land where it appears necessary or expedient in any cause or matter relating to land, as provided by para 2 of the First Schedule: <span class="font-italic">Tan Poh Beng v Choo Lee Mei </span>[2014] 4 SLR 462 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Poh Beng</span>”) at [13].

</div>
</div> The principles identified at [57] were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)    In deciding whether it is necessary or expedient for a sale to be ordered in lieu of partition, the court conducts a balancing exercise of various factors, including (i) the state of the relationship between the parties (which would be indicative of whether they are likely to be able to co-operate in the future); (ii) the state of the property; and (iii) the prospect of the relationship between the parties deteriorating if a sale was not granted such that a “clean-break” would be preferable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)    Regard should be had to the potential prejudice that the various co-owners might face in each of the possible scenarios, namely, if a sale is granted and if it is not granted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)    A sale would not generally be ordered if to do so would violate a prior agreement between the co-owners concerning the manner in which the land may be disposed of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I did not think that these factors, which are largely limited to the joint ownership context, were applicable to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiff and Ms Tee also referred to <span class="font-italic">Palk and another v Mortgage Services Funding plc </span>[1993]<span class="font-italic"> </span>2 All ER 481 (“<span class="font-italic">Palk</span>”), where the English Court of Appeal considered the court’s power to direct a sale of mortgaged property under s 91(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK). This provision allows a mortgagor to seek an order for sale of mortgaged property when faced with an action for redemption or foreclosure. The Court ordered the sale of the mortgaged property against the mortgagee’s wishes notwithstanding that the proceeds of sale would not discharge the mortgage debt. The mortgagee’s plan of action was to postpone the sale in the hope that the property market would improve. During this period, the interest on the mortgage debt would continue to accrue and would exceed the rental under the mortgagor’s proposed letting, and the risk of increased loss to the mortgagee outweighed any prospect of gain the mortgagor might make. The Court held at 488f that the court in exercising its discretion to order a sale under s 91(2) should have due regard to the interests of all concerned. It was just and equitable to order a sale in these circumstances because otherwise unfairness and injustice would follow (at 488g).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Although the considerations in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>and <span class="font-italic">Palk </span>differ somewhat from the present case, I am of the view that the court should consider the interests of those affected in the round when exercising its discretion to order the sale of property. Any outcome that is reached should be fair and just. In general, where an execution creditor wishes to effect the sale of mortgaged immovable property that is seized under a writ of seizure and sale and cannot obtain the mortgagee’s consent, the court should conduct a balancing exercise of the following non-exhaustive factors to decide if it is “necessary or expedient”, as required under para 2 of the First Schedule to the SCJA and O 31 r 1 of the ROC, to order a sale of the property:

The court would also be entitled to consider, for instance, the fact that a mortgagor-judgment debtor and his family members may face substantial prejudice if they reside at the property in question and are at risk of being evicted pursuant to a forced sale. Similarly, it would be relevant to the court that the judgment debt is being enforced for the benefit of third parties like the parties’ children in the present case. I note, however, that third party interests in this context would have to be considered in the light of the object of Part XIII of the LTA, which is to enable judgment creditors to obtain the fruits of their judgments against registered land: see <span class="font-italic">Chia Kin Tuck </span>at [13], citing John Baalman, <span class="font-italic">The Singapore Torrens System</span><span class="font-italic">: Being a Commentary on the Land Titles Ordinance, 1956 of the State of Singapore</span> (The Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) at p 211.
