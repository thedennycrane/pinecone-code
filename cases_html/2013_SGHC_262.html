        Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
case concerns the judicial review of the Singapore Land Authority’s
(“the SLA”) assessment of the differential premium (“DP”) payable
for the lifting of title restrictions for two particular plots of
land. The applicant alleges that the assessment of the DP was done
without reference to the Development Charge Table of Rates (“the
DC Table”) published by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the
URA”). The applicant thus seeks a quashing order against the assessed
DP and a mandatory order to direct the SLA to assess the DP in accordance
with the DC Table. The Attorney-General, a non-party to the action,
also made submissions during the hearing before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts leading to the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
applicant is a company in the business of property development. It
is currently the lessee of adjoining plots of land identified as
Lot Nos 1338M TS 17 (“Lot 1338M”) and 2818V TS 17 (“Lot 2818V”)
(collectively referred to as “the Land”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
applicant acquired Lots 1338M and 2818V on 15 January 2010 and 25
March 2010 respectively through competitive tenders for the purpose
of redevelopment. The SLA’s consent for the sale of both lots was needed
and this was duly obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
lease documents for both lots contained two references to the payment
of a differential premium. The first, which will henceforth be referred
to as the DP Clause, states thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The demised land shall not be used for
other than the abovementioned development except with the prior
permission of the Lessor. The lessee shall be required to pay a
differential premium, as appropriate, in respect of any increase
in floor area or change of use from a lower use category to higher
use category from the existing use which will result in an enhanced
value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second clause, henceforth referred to as the Land Return
Clause, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Lessee shall notify the Lessor in writing
of such portions of the demised land which are not used for the
purposes specified. If directed by the Lessor, the Lessee shall
surrender to the Lessor such land not used for the purposes specified
at rates equivalent to the compensation payable for such land if
it had been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act on the date
of the direction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that if the Lessor does not issue
a direction for the surrender of such land within 1 year from the
said notification by the Lessee under this clause or within such
other period as may otherwise be mutually agreed between the Lessor
and the Lessee, the Lessor shall, at the request of the Lessee,
lift the restrictions in the Lease under [the DP Clause] in relation
only to such land; subject to the Lessee obtaining the necessary
approvals from the relevant authorities regarding the proposed use
of such lands and the payment of a differential premium under [the
DP Clause].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Generally,
state land is sold at a price based on the proposed use and intensity
at the time of sale. State leases usually specify, as a condition
in the lease, the permissible use of the land under the lease and
the maximum gross floor area for the said permissible use. This
ensures that the land is used in line with prevailing land policy,
as evinced in the Master Plan (which is the statutory land use plan
guiding Singapore’s development in the medium term over the next
10 to 15 years). The Master Plan shows the permissible land use
and intensity for developments in Singapore. Each parcel of land
is zoned for different categories of land use, which include commercial,
residential and industrial use. Thus, state leases generally include
a DP clause which stipulates that a DP shall be payable if there
is a change in the use or an increase in the intensity of use beyond
the permissible amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
SLA published two circulars and maintained a website to provide the
public with information on how the payable DP is computed. The material
portions of the first circular, which was published sometime in 2000
(“the 2000 SLA Circular”), stated (with “PP” meaning Provisional Planning
Permission):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    With
effect from 31 July 2000, the Singapore Land Authority has implemented
a transparent system of determination of differential premium (DP)
for the lifting of State title restrictions involving change of
use and/or increase in intensity. This is to encourage optimisation
of land use and to facilitate the overall pace of redevelopment
in Singapore. It will also provide greater certainty to landowners
who will now be able to compute the DP payable themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The determination of DP will be based
on the published Table of Development Charge (DC) rates. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Where
the use as spelt out in a particular title restriction does not
fit into any of the Use Groups in the Table of DC Rates, the DP
payable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    As
the material date for determination of DP is pegged to the PP date, all
applications for lifting of title restriction must have a valid
PP. Applications without a valid PP will be rejected. The Singapore
Land Authority reserves the discretion on whether to grant an application
for lifting of title restriction and/or topping up of lease in accordance
with its policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    The
new system for determining DP does not apply to the computation of
premium payable for the upgrading of lease tenure (i.e. the topping-up
of lease tenure). Such premium will still be assessed by the Chief
Valuer on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    If you have any queries concerning
this circular, please feel free to contact us at SLA. We will be
pleased to answer queries on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
second circular, published sometime in 2007 (“the 2007 SLA Circular”),
is substantially similar to the 2000 SLA Circular:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    With
effect from 18 July 2007, in line with the revision of the Development
Charge (DC) system whereby Government will peg the amount of DC
based on 70% of the enhancement in land value, the differential premium
(DP) system will similarly be adjusted for the lifting of State
title restrictions involving change of use and/or increase in intensity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The determination of DP will still
be based on the published Table of Development Charge (DC) rates.
The material date of determination of DP will be pegged to the date
of Provisional Planning Permission (PP) or the start date of the
validity of the second and subsequent PP extensions, similar to
DC. The prevailing Table of DC rates at the grant of PP will be
used.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Where
the use as spelt out in a particular title restriction does not
fit into any of the Use Groups in the Table of DC Rates, the DP
payable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    As the material date for determination
of DP is pegged to the PP date, all applications for lifting of
title restriction must have a valid PP. Applications without a valid
PP will be rejected. The Singapore Land Authority reserves the right
on whether to grant an application for lifting of title restriction
in accordance with its prevailing policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The
basis of charging 50% of the full value for remnant State land will remained
unchanged notwithstanding the revision of the Development Charge
(DC) system and correspondingly, the Table of DC Rates. Accordingly,
SLA will apply a factor of 5/7 to the new revised Table of DC Rates
(i.e. Table of DC Rate x 5/7 x size of remnant State land x plot
ratio) when computing the premium for remnant State land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    If you have any queries concerning
this circular, please feel free to contact us at SLA. We will be
pleased to answer queries on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
material portions of the SLA website (as assessed on 20 January 2011)
are reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Differential Premium</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A payment, known as differential premium
(DP), will be charged for lifting the title restriction. The DP
is the difference in value between the use and/or intensity stated
in the State title and the approved use and/or intensity in the provisional
planning permission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DP is computed based on the Development
Charge (DC) Table of Rates. The material date of determination of
DP is pegged to the date of Provisional Permission (PP) or the date
of the second and subsequent PP extensions. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the use stipulated in the title restriction
does not fit into any of the Use Groups in the DC Table, the DP
payable will be determined by the Chief Valuer on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Option for Spot Valuation</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Landowners/developers who are not satisfied
with the differential premium (DP) payable based on the Development
Charge (DC) Table of Rates can write in to SLA to appeal against
the differential premium amount. SLA will then consult Chief Valuer
(CV) for a spot valuation. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the new DP payable upon appeal turns
out to be higher than the initial DP based on the DC Table of Rates,
the appellant is not allowed to fall back on the initial DP amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the appellant is still not satisfied
with Chief Valuer’s spot valuation, another appeal can be made.
However, before the second appeal is processed, the appellant must
pay up the DP (based on CV’s valuation) first and an appeal fee
of $10,000. If the revised DP on the second appeal is lower than
the first appeal, the excess amount collected will be returned.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
first affidavit of Thong Wai Lin, the Director of the Land Sales and
Acquisition Division of the SLA, explains (at [27], [86] and [87])
how the Table of Development Charge rates are determined. The DC
Table is split across different categories of land use and different
geographical sector areas in Singapore. There is a specific rate
for each category of land use in each particular sector area. The
rates are revised half-yearly in March and September. The rates
are not spot valuations but are based on past transactional prices
of a preceding six-month period and on the average of such prices
in a particular sector area. As the DC Table is a snapshot of rates determined
in advance, the DC Table does not necessarily reflect the actual prevailing
value of land. In a rising market, the DC Table’s rates would be lower
than spot valuations. In contrast, a spot valuation assesses the
actual value of a piece of land at the time of assessment. A plot
of land located in a more desirable location may have a much higher
value than another plot of land in the same sector. The Chief Valuer
takes into account various factors, including transactions involving
similar developments (corrected for differences in time), the natural
attributes of the land, its shape, and its accessibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On
or about 25 January 2010 (shortly after the applicant had acquired Lot
1338M), the applicant filed an application with the URA for the requisite
planning permission for redevelopment. Provisional permission was
granted on 2 July 2010. The applicant then submitted revised plans
to comply with the requirements of the provisional permission. Planning permission
was granted by the URA on 14 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On
or about 25 January 2011, the applicant submitted an application to
the SLA for the lifting of title restrictions on the Land for the
purposes of redevelopment. On or about 21 February 2011, the applicant’s
solicitors, Legal21 LLC, wrote to the SLA to seek the SLA’s written
consent to sell units in the proposed redevelopment to individual
purchasers and to align the lease tenures of Lots 1338M and 2818V
(which had 67 and 64 years remaining respectively). By way of an
email dated 4 March 2011, the SLA informed Legal21 LLC that “[a]pplications
for consent for sale typically take approximately 4 weeks from the
date of receipt to process” but that the SLA was “happy to expedite
the case” and hoped to give a definite response by 9 March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
15 March 2011, the SLA sent an email to the applicants stating that
the alignment of the tenures of both Lots 1338M and 2818V would involve
a downgrading of the tenure of Lot 1338M which required a surrender
and re-issue of the lease for the said lot. The email also stated
that the SLA would process the application for the lifting of title
restrictions upon approval for the downgrading of tenure; this would
ensure that the calculation of the DP payable took into account
the aligned tenure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
applicant made numerous telephone calls and sent many emails between
March and November 2011 to rush the SLA into making a decision.
In the meantime, the applicant obtained the requisite construction
permit on 8 April 2011 and started construction work despite the
lack of response. Finally, on 29 November 2011, the SLA wrote a
letter to Legal21 LLC. The contents of this letter are set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The
Lessor has no objections to the sale of the individual units in
the Development by your client in respect of [the Land]. The consent
is restricted to the particular sale and all the other covenants
[in the leases] shall remain in full force and respect</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Your
client has also applied for the downgrading of [Lot 1338M] to align
with the tenure of [Lot 2818V] which is currently being processed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    As for your client’s application to
lift title restrictions in respect of [the Land], we would like
to inform your client that <b>differential premium
equal to 100% of the enhancement to land value as assessed by the
Chief Valuer will be levied for the lifting of title restrictions</b>.
Before we may process this application, your client is required
to apply to URA to subdivide [Lot 2818V] since [Lot 2818V] will
be developed separately from its remaining parcel. Please let us
have a copy of the URA’s written permission for the sub-division once
that is issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    You may contact the undersigned if
you have further questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
applicant accordingly applied for, and obtained on 4 January 2012,
the URA’s permission for the requisite sub-division of Lot 2818V. This
was forwarded to the SLA. On 13 January 2012, the SLA wrote to the applicant
stating that it was prepared to recommend the surrender of the existing
title to Lot 1338M and re-issue a fresh title to align the tenures
of Lots 1338M and 2818V. The applicant accepted this offer on 8
February 2012. On 16 August 2012, the SLA informed the applicant
that the surrender and the re-issue were approved. To that end,
the SLA wrote to the applicant on 14 September 2012, attaching the
re-issued lease for execution. The applicant duly executed the re-issued
lease on 24 September 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On
20 February 2013, the SLA wrote to the applicant stating that it was
prepared to lift the title restriction upon payment of $44,067,828.23. The
breakdown of this sum is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     DP
in respect of Lot 1338M     $33,523,349.00</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On
6 March 2013, the applicant wrote to the SLA seeking clarification on
how the DPs payable were calculated. In its reply dated 13 March
2013, the SLA stated that the DPs were “assessed by the Chief Valuer
based on 100% enhancement in land value for the lifting of title
restrictions.” Legal21 LLC, in a letter to the SLA dated 2 April
2013, wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect, your said letter of reply
dated 13 March 2013 is unhelpful, as no requested clarification
on the basis of calculation of the differential premium set out
in your said letter dated 20 February 2013 was offered. Specifically, our
clients would like to seek clarification on which date the determination
of the differential premium is pegged to, and which table of development
charge rates was used. Our clients have instructed a team of valuers
to conduct a separate assessment to the Chief Valuer’s assessment
of the differential premium payable and to render advice on the
same to our clients. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
SLA sent a letter on 3 April 2013, stating that the material date
for the determination of the DP was 2 July 2010 (<em>i.e.</em>,
the date of provisional permission). More importantly, the SLA also
stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The differential premium payable in respect
of Lots 1338M and [2818V] is determined by the Chief Valuer. As
such, the Development Charge table was not adopted in determining
the differential premium.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On
9 April 2013, Legal21 LLC wrote a further letter to the SLA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are instructed to request for clarification
as to why the table of development charge rates, which is the prescribed
method of assessment as published by SLA, was not adopted in determining
the differential premium payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are further instructed that the differential
premium payable for the 2 plots, computed based on the table of
development charge rates as at March 2010, are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In respect of Lot [1338M]     S$8,831,607</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In respect of Lot [2818V]     S$2,343,508</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
SLA replied to Legal21 LLC by way of a letter dated 11 April 2013 stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would like to explain that <b>this case is different from conventional leasehold
sites</b> because lots 1338M and [2818V] <b>were
formerly directly alienated to the former owner instead of through
competitive tender.</b> Under the applicable policy for lifting
restrictions on directly alienated properties, and where the land
is capable of independent development, private sector lessees are
required to pay differential premium (DP) based on the full difference
(i.e. 100%) between the land values based on the proposed and original
use / intensity, if allowed. The Government has stated clearly on 29
Nov 11 that DP pegged at 100% of the enhancement in land values
will be levied for the lifting of title restrictions in this case.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In
response, Legal21 LLC wrote to the SLA on 24 April 2013, seeking the
following particulars:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Full
details of the policy pertaining to the DP chargeable for directly

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As
an aside, the Policy was applied to the proposed redevelopment by CapitaLand
of Market Street Car Park. This was widely reported in the Straits
Times and the Business Times. In particular, in a news release dated 3
January 2008, it was stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The existing lease of Market Street Car

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On
30 April 2013, Legal21 LLC wrote to the SLA stating that the applicant
wished to appeal against the assessed DP on a without prejudice basis
and enclosed a cheque for the $5,000 appeal fee. Legal21 LLC also stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Further, there are no conditions specified
under [the Leases of both lots] to indicate that [the Land] was
“special” and this warranted a different method of computing the
differential premiums. In all the circumstances, our clients take
the position that the Chief Valuer ought to have assessed the enhancement
in land value by reference to the Development Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For
the purposes of the appeal, the SLA met with the applicant on 8 May
2013. The SLA explained to the applicant the mechanism behind the computation
of the DP (<em>i.e.</em>, 100% of the enhancement
in value of the land as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation).
A further meeting was held on 15 May 2013, where representatives
of the applicant, SLA and the Chief Valuer’s Office (“CVO”) were
present. The applicant brought valuers from Colliers International
(Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Colliers”) along to the meeting. The CVO explained
to Colliers that the CVO had adopted the comparison method, which
involves using comparables with similar land use, for the spot valuation
used to determine the DP payable. The applicant allegedly agreed
at the meeting to submit a valuation report for CVO’s consideration.
This originating summons was filed on 17 May 2013. In a letter dated
6 July 2013 (<em>i.e.</em>, after this Originating
Summons was filed) from Legal21 LLC to Allen &amp; Gledhill (the
SLA’s solicitors), the applicants denied that they had agreed to
furnish the CVO with an alternative valuation report. The applicant
has since withdrawn from the appeal process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At
a pre-trial conference on 5 June 2013, the Attorney-General applied
to be given the right to be heard at the substantive hearing before me.
That was granted by the Assistant Registrar. At another pre-trial conference
on 12 July 2013 before me, the parties agreed to address both the issue
of leave and the substantive hearing in a consolidated hearing because of
the urgency of the matter. Accordingly this judgment will deal with
both the application for leave for judicial review and the merits
of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Leave and other preliminary
issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     An
applicant seeking judicial review must meet three conditions for leave
to be granted (<em>Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v
Attorney-General</em> [2013] 1 SLR 619 at [5] and affirmed
by the Court of Appeal ([2013] SGCA 56 at [5])):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
subject matter must be susceptible to judicial review;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
applicant has sufficient interest (i.e., <em>locus
standi</em>) in the matter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
material before the court discloses an arguable or <em>prima facie</em> case
of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought
by the applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
parties agreed that the subject matter was susceptible to judicial review
and that the applicant had sufficient interest in the matter to
apply for judicial review. Accordingly the only issue before me
with regard to leave is whether the applicant could make out an
arguable or <em>prima facie</em> case of
reasonable suspicion. As the parties had agreed to consolidate the application
for leave with the substantive application, the applicant’s case would
therefore be decided on its merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There
are however two preliminary issues which have to be decided before
the substantive issues can be addressed. The first issue pertains
to whether the application for leave is out of time due to the operation
of O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5 2006 Rev Ed).
The second relates to whether the applicant had exhausted all alternative
remedies before seeking judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the application for leave
out of time?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     O
53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, leave shall
not be granted to apply for a <b>Quashing Order</b> to
remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the
purpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is
made within 3 months after the date of the proceeding or such other period
(if any) as may be prescribed by any written law or, except where
a period is so prescribed, the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction
of the Judge to whom the application for leave is made; and where
the proceeding is subject to appeal and a time is limited by law
for the bringing of the appeal, the Judge may adjourn the application
for leave until the appeal is determined or the time for appealing
has expired. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The
applicant took the position that the SLA made its decision on 20 February
2013 as that was when the SLA informed the applicant of the amount
of DP payable (see [16] above). It was only then that the applicant became
aware of the SLA’s decision to assess the DP payable without reference
to the DC Table. As the application for leave to apply for judicial review
was filed on 17 May 2013, the application was made within the time prescribed
by O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
SLA argued that the effective date of the SLA’s decision was 29 November
2011 (see [14] above). That was the date the SLA first conveyed to
the applicant that the DP levied in its case would be “equal to
100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer”
and not based on the DC Table rates. The application was therefore
way out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
Attorney-General did not make any submissions on whether the application
was out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
applicant made several arguments in support of its contention that
the SLA decision was made on 20 February 2013:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     DP
is assessed and imposed only after the SLA has made a decision to
allow the lifting of title restrictions. As SLA only decided to
lift title restrictions on 20 February 2013, the decision pertaining
to the assessment of the DP could only have been made on or after
20 February 2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
29 November 2011 letter was wholly unclear and could not reasonably
be construed to be a decision on the assessment of DP payable. The
SLA stated that the application for lifting of title restrictions
would be processed only after approval for subdivision for the lot
now known as Lot 2818V.  The DP payable would be assessed by the
SLA only in the course of processing the application for lifting of
title restrictions. The applicant also made several calls to the
SLA to enquire about the amount of DP payable but received no response until
20 February 2013;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
29 November 2011 letter, while referring to DP being payable at
100% of the land enhancement value, did not indicate to the applicant
that the SLA had decided to assess DP without reference to the DC
Table. The applicant had understood the letter to mean that the
DC Table would be adopted but that DP would be assessed at 100%
of the applicable DC Table. This was buttressed by the 2007 SLA
Circular in which the SLA wrote that it would “apply a factor of 5/7
to the new revised Table of DC Rates” with regard to remnant State
land (see [7] above). The applicant reasonably expected that “100%
land enhancement value” would be calculated in a similar way; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
a letter from the SLA to Legal21 LLC dated 30 April 2013, the SLA
themselves wrote that “[i]n view of your appeal, we are pleased
to grant to your client a further extension of time to accept the
offer dated 20 Feb 13”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
SLA submitted that its decision was made on 29 November 2011. The
method of DP assessment stated in the 29 November 2011 letter was not
contingent on the sub-division of the lot now known as Lot 2818V.
The only thing pending was the quantum of DP payable. It was clear
that the letter informed the applicant of the SLA’s final decision
on the methodology for assessing the DP payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     O
53 r 1(6) also allows a court to grant an extension of time where “the
delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge” (see also <em>UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp</em> [2011]
3 SLR 94 at [49] and <em>Teng Fuh Holdings Pte
Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 568 at
[18]). The applicant submitted that the circumstances justified
the grant of an extension of time. The applicant at all material
times believed that the SLA would assess the DP payable in accordance
with the DC Table and only found out that the SLA would not be doing
so on 20 February 2013. The SLA submitted that an extension of time
should not be granted. The delay of more than 17 months was inordinately
long. Further, as an established and experienced developer, the
applicant should have understood the significance of the words “equal
to 100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed by the Chief
Valuer” to mean that the DC Table would not be used. Lastly, the
applicant had proceeded with the redevelopment and had already received
substantial payments from individual purchasers. It would therefore
be unfair to the SLA for the applicant to take advantage of this
and further delay the payment of the DP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I
agree with the applicant. Time only started to run from 20 February 2013
and not 29 November 2011. The SLA’s decision was a multiple-step decision
process. As a practical matter, the nub of the applicant’s complaint was
not just the method that was used to compute the DP payable but
also the outcome of that method. The applicant would have had no
grievance if the outcome of the Chief Valuer’s assessment of the
DP was similar to the DP payable under the DC Table. The 29 November
2011 letter did not specify the amount of money that was payable.
The applicant therefore did not have the full picture before it
and would not have been in a position to determine if an application
for judicial review should be made (indeed, an application at that
early stage would have been premature).  This is strengthened by
the SLA letter dated 30 April 2013 (see [33(d)] above) in which
the SLA said that the offer to lift the title restrictions upon
payment of the DP would run from 20 February 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     If
I am wrong on this point and time started running from 29 November
2011, I would hold that the delay in filing this originating summons
is justified for the same reasons articulated in [36]. It would
have been reasonable for the applicant in the circumstances of this
case to have misapprehended which event was the final decision to
challenge. In any case, O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court only applies
to quashing orders and not to mandatory orders. The applicant has
sought both a quashing order against the SLA’s decision and a mandatory
order requiring the SLA to assess the DP in accordance with the
DC Table. O 53 r 1(6) would only operate against the former and
not the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I
therefore hold that the application for judicial review is not time-barred
under O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the applicant exhaust all
possible alternative remedies?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As
a general rule, a person seeking judicial review of a decision by
a public body must exhaust all alternative remedies before invoking
the courts’ jurisdiction in judicial review (<em>Borissik
Svetlana v Urban Redevelopment Authority</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R)
92 at [25]). The applicant submitted that it was not caught by this
general rule because the prescribed appeal process presupposes a
developer which is not satisfied with a DP payable based on the
DC Table (see [8] above). As the DP payable in this case was not
based on the DC Table, the appeal process is inapplicable to the
applicant. The SLA submitted that the crux of the inquiry is whether
the alternative remedy is “equally effective and convenient” (citing <em>Regina v Hillingdon London Borough Council, Ex parte
Royco Homes Ltd</em> [1974] QB 720 at 728) and the administrative
appeal in this case was expedient and hassle-free and effective
in that the SLA and the Chief Valuer would be prepared to hear and
consider any alternative valuation that a developer puts forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
appeal process contemplates an aggrieved developer who, disagreeing
with the DP based on the DC Table, initiates an appeal process culminating
in the SLA consulting the Chief Valuer for a spot valuation. The
appeal process is not an alternative remedy for two reasons. First,
as the applicant has pointed out, the DP payable in its case was
not based on the DC Table and accordingly, the appeal process does
not apply to the applicant. Second, and more fundamentally, the
appeal process necessarily involves a spot valuation done by the
Chief Valuer. This is precisely the outcome that the applicant seeks
to impugn as the applicant argues that the DC Table should apply.
There is simply no room in the prescribed process for the DP to
be assessed based on DC Table rates. The foregoing also accords
with <em>Regina v Secretary of State for the Home
Department, Ex parte Swati</em> [1986] 1 WLR 477 at 485, where
Sir John Donaldson MR held that the general rule does not apply
where “the applicant can distinguish his case from the type of case
for which the appeal procedure was provided.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I
therefore hold that the applicant did not fail to comply with the general
rule to exhaust all alternative remedies before invoking the courts’ jurisdiction
in judicial review. There were no alternative remedies for the applicant
to seek.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substantive application
for judicial review</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Weight to be ascribed to Gaw
Seng Suan’s affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
SLA disputed the admissibility of, and the weight to be ascribed to,
an affidavit filed by a Gaw Seng Suan (“Gaw”), an ex-employee of
the SLA. The applicant had requested Gaw to provide an expert opinion
on the issue of whether the Land Return Clause in the leases for
both lots (see [4] above) would have indicated to a reasonable property
developer looking to purchase the Land that the DP payable for a
change in use of the Land would be assessed at 100% of land enhancement
value as assessed by the Chief Valuer through a spot valuation.
Gaw opined that a reasonable developer in the applicant’s shoes
would expect the DP payable to be assessed on the basis of the DC
Table and that it was not market knowledge that the presence of
a Land Return Clause in a lease would lead to a higher DP or the
DP being assessed on a different basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The
SLA argued that Gaw’s expert evidence is inadmissible. The issue at
stake is not a question of expert opinion because it does not pertain
to any point of scientific, technical or other specialised knowledge.
Mr Gaw was never a property developer. In any case, Gaw’s responsibilities
at the SLA pertained to records management and administrative work.
Gaw was not involved in any work relating to the DP Clause and/or
the Land Return Clause or the policy of charging DP equal to 100%
of the enhancement of land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer.
Thus, Gaw had no basis to hold himself out as an expert nor did
he have any particular insight into the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In
response, the applicant pointed out that it was not disputed that Gaw
had worked on the change in DP policy (<em>i.e.</em>,
from spot valuations for all cases to the DC Table-based system)
which eventually resulted in the issue of the 2000 SLA Circular.
Gaw also had significant experience providing specialist advice
on land matters to private sector clients, including issues relating
to the lifting of title restrictions and DP assessments. The fact
that Gaw was not a property developer is not a reason to disregard
his evidence. Further, s 47 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev
Ed) states that expert evidence is admissible if the court is “likely
to derive assistance from an opinion upon a point of scientific,
technical or other specialised knowledge” and it was introduced
in 2012 to broaden the categories of admissible expert evidence
and to allow the Court to have the benefit of any expert opinion
that may be useful and is in the interests of justice (citing the
second reading of the Evidence (Amendment) Bill as reported in <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (14
February 2012) vol 88).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The
Attorney-General submitted that the question posed to Gaw — that
is, whether the Land Return Clause would have put a reasonable property
developer on notice — is a question for the court’s determination and
not for expert opinion. As the Court of Appeal held in <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and
another appeal</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [85] (in turn citing <em>The H156</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 419 at [27]),
an expert may not usurp the function of the court and present his
finding. In other words, an expert may not answer the very question
that is before the court (in this regard, see also Chen Siyuan,
“Expert Evidence and the Ultimate Issue Rule” (2011) Research Collection
School of Law, Paper 21 (&lt;http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/sol_research_smu/21&gt;,
accessed on 22 October 2013). Further, there was no explanation
as to how Gaw’s experience equipped him to provide an opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In
my view, Gaw’s evidence was admissible pursuant to s 47 of the Evidence
Act. However, his evidence was of limited weight. The issue is not just
about actual knowledge — the enquiry also touches on constructive knowledge
(<em>i.e.</em>, what a reasonable property
developer would have known had he made the requisite enquiries,
as shall be discussed below at [122] to [127]). Gaw was not a property
developer and his opinion with regard to whether a reasonable property
developer would have known that the Land Return Clause meant that
the DP payable would be based on a spot valuation by the Chief Valuer
at 100% of the enhancement value would be premised on, at best,
second-hand knowledge based on his dealings with private sector
developers. His second-hand knowledge would not be persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The
applicant’s various arguments can essentially be divided into two strands:
first, the SLA’s decision to assess DP via a spot valuation was irrational
and unreasonable because no public authority would act so inconsistently,
especially in the light of the unequivocal representations made.
Second, the SLA’s decision deprived the applicant of its legitimate expectation
of the DP being assessed in accordance with the DC Table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
SLA argued, firstly, that its decision was not irrational and unreasonable
because the SLA has statutory duties and functions to discharge;
in particular, the public interest in ensuring that the State realises the
full value of State land. Secondly, the doctrine of substantive
legitimate expectation has yet to be accepted as part of Singapore
law. Even if it is part of the law, the applicant could not have
had the legitimate expectation that the DP would be assessed in
accordance with the DC Table. Even if the applicant had such a legitimate
expectation, the disappointment of that expectation in this case
was justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The
Attorney-General averred that the policy of assessing DP via a spot
valuation cannot be impugned in court because this would be tantamount
to a “merits review”. Moreover, the application of the policy to the
applicant was not unreasonable because it was done after due deliberation
with all stakeholders. The Attorney-General also argued that the
doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation should not be adopted
in Singapore. In any event, no substantive legitimate expectation
could be said to have arisen on the facts. At most, any legitimate
expectation would have pertained to procedure and this had already
been given effect to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Accordingly
two main issues arose for consideration in this case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was
the SLA’s decision to assess the DP through a spot valuation instead
of abiding by the DC Table irrational and/or unreasonable?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Should
the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation be recognised
in Singapore law? If so, can the applicant avail itself of this doctrine?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the SLA’s decision to assess
DP via a spot valuation irrational and/or unreasonable?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The
applicant’s first argument is that the SLA’s decision to assess
the DP by means of a spot valuation was irrational and/or unreasonable.
The assessment, it submitted, ought to have been in accordance with
the DC Table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation</em> [1948]
1 KB 223 (“<em>Wednesbury</em>”). Lord Greene
MR, speaking for a unanimous Court of Appeal, held (at 229) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true the discretion must be exercised
reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology
commonly used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often
use the word "unreasonable" in a rather comprehensive sense. It
has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description
of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted
with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in
law. <b>He must call his own attention to the
matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his
consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider.</b> If
he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is
said, to be acting "unreasonably." Similarly, there may be something
so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within
the powers of the authority. Warrington L.J. in Short v. Poole Corporation
[1926] Ch 66 gave the example of the red-haired teacher, dismissed
because she had red hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another
sense it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is
so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done
in bad faith; and, in fact, all these things run into one another.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In
the House of Lords decision of <em>Council of Civil
Service Unions and others v Minister of the Civil Service</em> [1985]
1 AC 374 (“the <em>GCHQ</em> case”), Lord
Diplock equated <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness
with irrationality (at 410):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By "irrationality" I mean what can by now
be succinctly referred to as "Wednesbury unreasonableness" (Associated
Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948]
1 K.B. 223). It applies to a decision which is <b>so
outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards
that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question
to be decided could have arrived at it.</b> Whether a decision
falls within this category is a question that judges by their training
and experience should be well equipped to answer, or else there
would be something badly wrong with our judicial system. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Diplock’s comments were adopted in Singapore law by the
Court of Appeal case of <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister
for Home Affairs and others and other appeals</em> [1988]
2 SLR(R) 525 (“<em>Chng Suan Tze</em>”) at
[119].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Both
the SLA and the Attorney-General contended that <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness
is a high standard that is difficult to meet. The SLA cited the
Court of Appeal case of <em>Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal
Singh and another v Attorney-General</em> [2013] SGCA 45 at
[7] where it was stated that “[t]he <em>Wednesbury</em> test
sets a high bar”. The Attorney-General relied on <em>Chee
Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</em> [2006]
1 SLR(R) 582 where V K Rajah J (as he then was) (at [125]) held
that the standard of unreasonableness “is from a jurisprudential
perspective, pragmatically fixed at a very high level”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Before
the analysis can proceed any further, it is useful to characterise the
act that the applicant is seeking to impugn as being unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The
SLA, in its first affidavit filed by Thong Wai Lin, Director of
the Land Sales and Acquisition Division of the SLA, averred (at
[36]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Directly-alienated lands, where the leases
contain the Land Return Clause, have always been one of those cases
to which the DC Table has no application. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of directly-alienated land
where the lease contains the Land Return Clause, the policy is to
charge DP based on <u>100% enhancement in value
as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation</u>,
if the State decides to forego the right to the return of the land
and to allow the requested change of use of the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The SLA thus characterised its decision as one that was made
pursuant to an existing policy and not as a result of a change in
policy. The SLA thus did not depart from the DC Table (a method
that was spelt out in the SLA circulars and the SLA website, see
[6] – [8] above). The Attorney-General essentially agreed with the
respondent and pointed out that there were two operative policies:
one concerning State leases without a Land Return Clause where the
DP payable is calculated according to the DC Table and another concerning
State leases with a Land Return Clause where, assuming that the
Government chooses not to exercise its right to require the return of
the land, the DP is charged based on 100% of the enhancement in
land value as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation.
The applicant did not indicate clearly which characterisation it
was relying on, presumably because its arguments would remain the
same either way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At
the outset, I would like to point out that there is an immense difference
between, on the one hand, the implementation of a second extant policy
(which was not discernible from the public statements put out by
the SLA), and on the other hand, a change in policy (with there
being only one policy applicable to start with) or a decision not
to apply a policy to a particular case. In the former, the policy
was already in operation at the time of the act in issue. In the
latter, the change of policy or decision not to apply the policy
is contemporaneous with the act in issue. The legal analysis that
flows from each characterisation is markedly and necessarily different. This
court’s analysis shall be premised on the former (see also [68]
– [71] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
applicant submitted that the plain wording of the SLA Circulars and
the SLA website is clear, unambiguous and affirmative: the DP would be
assessed by reference to the DC Table. No other policy or method
for assessing DP is specified in the aforementioned sources or in
any other publicly available document. The 2000 SLA Circular (see
[6] above) explicitly states that the specified method for assessing
DP is “a transparent system” which “provide[s] greater certainty
to landowners who will now be able to compute the DP payable themselves.”
The SLA Circulars and the SLA website are exhaustive and they only
specify two exceptions: where the use stipulated in the title restriction
does not fit into any of the use groups in the DC Table and where
the lease tenure is upgraded. None of these exceptions applies here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The
applicant argued that the SLA had acted unreasonably in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense because a legitimate
expectation arose that the “SLA will behave as it says it will”.
This conflates the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
with <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness.
The issue of whether substantive legitimate expectation is part
of Singapore law and if so, whether it is a stand-alone head of
judicial review or is in truth a subset of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness
will be discussed subsequently (see [117] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
essence of the applicant’s arguments was that it was unreasonable for
the SLA not to adhere to its public promulgations. The applicant proceeded
to point out that the existing policy of charging a DP based on 100%
enhancement in value as assessed by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation
(see [56] above) is inconsistent with an earlier statement by the then
Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report</em> (19 July 2010) vol 87, at col
815):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, DP or DC rate is pegged at 70%
of the enhancement in land value.  The DP or DC collected allows
the State to provide the necessary infrastructure and services (eg,
roads, drainage and sewerage) without which the developer cannot
materialise the higher development intensity in the area.  <b>The balance of the gain from the land value enhancement
is retained by the land-owner and provides an incentive for him
to undertake the development work.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In calibrating the DC rate, there is a
need to balance between providing an equitable share of the land
value enhancement for the State to fund the necessary infrastructure
and services and, at the same time, providing a reasonable incentive
for land-owners and developers to undertake development works. We
believe that the current 70% DC rate is reasonable in the current
market conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, the 2000 SLA Circular (see [6] above) states
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With effect from 31 July 2000, the Singapore
Land Authority has implemented a transparent system of determination
of differential premium (DP) for the lifting of State title restrictions
involving change of use and/or increase in intensity. <b>This is to encourage optimisation of land use and
to facilitate the overall pace of redevelopment in Singapore</b>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Further,
on its plain terms, the Land Return Clause only requires the lessee
to inform the SLA if any part of the land is not being used for
the purpose specified in the lease. When the applicant made its
application for the lifting of title restrictions, the whole of
the land was being used for the specified purposes. Thus the question
of the State giving up its right to take back the land does not
even arise and it would be wrong to assess the DP on the basis of
compensating the state for giving up such a right. Additionally, the
SLA has not been able to provide any explanation as to why the policy should
apply to subsequent <em>bona fide</em> purchasers
of directly alienated lands, where the subsequent purchaser obtained
the land through a competitive tender process and derived no benefit
from the earlier direct alienation. The subsequent purchaser would
also have no way of finding out that the land was directly alienated
to the former owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The
SLA averred that it was not unreasonable for the DP to be assessed
by a spot valuation at 100% value.  It was in the interests of the public
for the State to realise the full value of any land that it disposes
of. Where directly alienated land is concerned, the State is in
fact forfeiting its legal right to take back the land (pursuant
to the Land Return Clause) and the chance to re-sell the land at
a higher price in a competitive tender. The State must ensure that
it obtains a DP that fully and accurately reflects the enhancement
in value that the state is foregoing. Indeed, the SLA was merely
discharging its statutory duties and functions. Section 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Singapore Land Authority Act
(Cap 301, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the SLA Act”) states that it shall be the
function and duty of the SLA “to optimise land resources”. This
necessarily entails a duty on SLA’s part to obtain the full enhancement
on land value where directly-alienated state lands are concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
Attorney-General argued that the reasonableness (or otherwise) of
the policy to assess DP by a spot valuation at full value is a “polycentric” matter
which is not suited to a “merits review” by the court. In assessing
the DP, the SLA acts as the agent of the Government (s 6(1)(<em>e</em>)(iv) of the SLA Act). In carrying out
this function, the SLA is involved in “polycentric” decision making;
s 6(2) of the SLA Act stipulates:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In carrying out its functions, the Authority
shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    have regard to efficiency
and economy and to the social, industrial, commercial and economic
needs of Singapore…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It
is well-established that the courts will be slow to review such “polycentric”
matters. In <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing
Co Ltd and another and another suit</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 453
(“<em>Lee Hsien Loong</em>”), Sundaresh Menon
JC (as he then was) held (at [96] and [98]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96    Second,
within the span of executive decisions that are immune from judicial
review are those involving matters of "high policy". This includes such
matters as dissolving Parliament, the conduct of foreign affairs,
the making of treaties, matters pertaining to war, the deployment
of the armed forces and issues pertaining to national defence. These
are what the American courts call "political questions" and the
reasons underlying the deference accorded to the executive branch
of government in such areas have been articulated in the cases I
have referred to. In my judgment, cases concerning international
boundary disputes or the recognition of foreign governments comfortably
fall within this class of cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98    …
In my judgment, the correct approach is not to assume a highly rigid
and categorical approach to deciding which cases are not justiciable. Rather,
as Laws LJ put it in Marchiori ([94] supra) at [39], the intensity
of judicial review will depend upon the context in which the issue
arises and upon common sense, which takes into account the simple
fact that there are certain questions in respect of which there
can be no expectation that an unelected judiciary will play any
role. In this regard, the following principles bear noting:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Justiciability
depends, not on the source of the decision-making power, but on
the subject matter that is in question. Where it is the executive
that has access to the best materials available to resolve the issue,
its views should be regarded as highly persuasive, if not decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Where the decision involves matters
of government policy and requires the intricate balancing of various
competing policy considerations that judges are ill-equipped to
adjudicate because of their limited training, experience and access
to materials, the courts should shy away from reviewing its merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The
Attorney-General also cited Lord Woolf, <em>et
al, De Smith’s Judicial Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
7th Ed, 2013)  at paras [1-042] and [1-043]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A third limitation on the court’s institutional
capacity occurs when a legal challenge is made on substantive grounds
to a matter which is “polycentric” — where the decision-taker has
broad discretion involving policy and public interest considerations.
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Most “allocative decisions” — decisions
involving the distribution of limited resources — fall into the
category of polycentric decisions. If the court alters such a decision,
the judicial intervention will set up a chain reaction, requiring
a rearrangement of other decisions with which the original has interacting
points of influence. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Another typical polycentric decision is
one involving the allocation of scarce resources among competing
claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It
was submitted that the formulation of the policy to assess the DP
by a spot valuation was clearly a polycentric decision that was
taken only after due deliberation and consultation with other relevant
agencies and stakeholders on whether to exercise the right to take
back the land. This policy is inextricably intertwined with the
State’s macro-policy considerations of what is in Singapore’s economic,
commercial, industrial and social interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In
order to satisfy the high threshold of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness,
the applicant must show that the SLA had, on one formulation, taken
into account extraneous considerations that it should not have taken
into account or had not taken into account considerations which
it should have taken into account. Alternatively, the applicant
must show that the SLA’s decision was so outrageous in its defiance
of logic that no sensible person who had applied his mind could
have arrived at the same decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     There
are three ways of characterising the SLA’s allegedly unreasonable
conduct:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_a"></a>(a)     Applying
the policy of assessing the DP via a spot valuation at 100% of land
enhancement value;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     Applying
the policy of assessing DP via a spot valuation at 100% of land
enhancement value but not disclosing the existence of such a policy
beforehand;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_c"></a>(c)     Applying
the policy of assessing DP via a spot valuation and at 100% of land
enhancement value, not disclosing the policy beforehand and not
taking into account the applicant’s legitimate expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In
the first characterisation, it is the policy alone that is being impugned.
The SLA, in formulating policy, is statutorily obliged to have regard
to “efficiency and economy and to the social, industrial, commercial and
economic needs of Singapore” (s 6(2) of the SLA Act, see [63] above). The
balancing of these competing interests is not within the institutional competence
of the judiciary (<em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> (at
[98(b)], see [64] above). Thus, the policy by itself cannot be said
to be unreasonable in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     However,
the applicant was not aggrieved by the SLA’s policy. The applicant’s
complaint was that the policy was not publicised, giving it the impression
that the publicised policy (that is, DP assessed at DC Table rates)
would apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     At
common law, there is no legal duty on the part of the Government to
publicise the policies which it seeks to implement. In the context
of administrative decisions, there is no general rule that reasons
must be given (see <em>e.g. Marta Stefan v General
Medical Council</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1293 at 1300G-H). It was
therefore not unreasonable in the <em>Wednesbury</em> sense
for the SLA not to publicise its policy of assessing DP via a spot
valuation at 100% of the land enhancement value. In any case, the
applicant’s contention was that it was led to believe that the said
policy would refer to the DC Table anyway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This
leaves me with the last characterisation — that it was unreasonable
for the SLA to have applied an undisclosed policy to the applicant’s
case and thereby neglecting unreasonably to take into account the
applicant’s legitimate expectation. This issue will be dealt with
in the discussion on the law pertaining to substantive legitimate
expectations (see [118] – [128] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should the doctrine of substantive
legitimate expectations be recognised in Singapore law? If so, can
the applicant avail itself of this doctrine?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The
term “legitimate expectation” was first used by Lord Denning MR in <em>Schmidt and another v Secretary of State for Home
Affairs</em> [1969] 2 Ch 149 (“<em>Schmidt</em>”).
The case concerned the Home Secretary’s decision to refuse an extension
of a foreign student’s temporary permit to stay in the United Kingdom.
Lord Denning MR rejected the foreign student’s contention that he
ought to have been afforded a hearing. He held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It all depends on whether he has some right
or interest, or, I would add, some legitimate expectation, of which
it would not be fair to deprive him without hearing what he has
to say.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In
the <em>GCHQ</em> case, a majority of the
House of Lords held that the applicants there had a legitimate expectation
that they would be consulted before their rights to unionise were
taken away. This duty was however overridden by national security
concerns. Lord Diplock held (at 408F – 409A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To qualify as a subject for judicial review
the decision must have consequences which affect some person (or
body of persons) other than the decision-maker, although it may
affect him too. It must affect such other person either:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    by
altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable
by or against him in private law; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    by depriving him of some benefit or
advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by
the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect
to be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated
to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has
been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from
the decision-maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first
an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should
not be withdrawn. (I prefer to continue to call the kind of expectation
that qualifies a decision for inclusion in class (b) a "legitimate
expectation" rather than a "reasonable expectation," in order thereby
to indicate that it has consequences to which effect will be given
in public law, whereas an expectation or hope that some benefit
or advantage would continue to be enjoyed, although it might well
be entertained by a "reasonable" man, would not necessarily have
such consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same case, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton formulated the
doctrine of legitimate expectations on a more general basis which
could be construed to include substantive (as opposed to merely
procedural) relief (at 401A-B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But even where a person claiming some benefit
or privilege has no legal right to it, as a matter of private law,
he may have a legitimate expectation of receiving the benefit or
privilege, and, if so, the courts will protect his expectation by
judicial review as a matter of public law. This subject has been fully
explained by my noble and learned friend, Lord Diplock, in O'Reilly
v. Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237 and I need not repeat what he has so
recently said. Legitimate, or reasonable, expectation may arise
either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority
or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can
reasonably expect to continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     For
the moment, I turn my attention to related cases which granted substantive
relief on other grounds. The Court of Appeal case of <em>Lever (Finance) Ltd v Westminster Corporation</em> [1970]
3 All ER 496 (“<em>Lever Finance</em>”) granted
relief on the ground of estoppel. In that case, developers applied
for and obtained planning permission to build 14 houses on a particular
tract of land. A month after this, the developers’ architect made some
variations to the plan. One of the houses was to be sited 23 feet
away from existing houses (as opposed to 40 feet under the original
approved plan).  The planning authority’s planning officer had lost
the file containing the original approved plan and because of this
mistakenly told the developer’s architect over the telephone that
this variation was not material and that no further planning consent
was required. The developers went ahead with construction. Sometime
later, the planning authority said that planning permission was
actually required (after complaints received by the existing residents)
and permission was subsequently denied. The developers sought an
injunction restraining the authority from serving an enforcement
notice requiring them to demolish the half-built house. Lord Denning
MR (at 500h–j) held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I know that there are authorities which
say that a public authority cannot be estopped by any representations
made by its officers. It cannot be estopped from doing its public
duty. See, for instance, the recent decision of the Divisional Court
in Southend-on-Sea Corpn v Hodgson (Wickford) Ltd. But those statements
must now be taken with considerable reserve. There are many matters
which public authorities can now delegate to their officers. If an
officer, acting within the scope of his ostensible authority, makes
a representation on which another acts, then a public authority
may be bound by it, just as much as a private concern would be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The
House of Lords case of <em>In re Preston</em> [1985]
1 AC 835 held that substantive relief could be granted on the basis
of abuse of power where the conduct complained about is equivalent
to a breach of contract or a breach of representation. The case
concerned a taxpayer who alleged that an officer from the Inland
Revenue Commissioners (“IRC”) had represented to him that the IRC
would not raise further inquiries on his tax affairs if the taxpayer
withdrew certain claims for interest relief and capital loss.  The House
of Lords found that no such representation was made. Nevertheless, Lord
Templeman said (at 864G) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court can only intervene by judicial
review to direct the commissioners to abstain from performing their
statutory duties or from exercising their statutory powers if the
court is satisfied that "the unfairness" of which the applicant
complains renders the insistence by the commissioners on performing
their duties or exercising their powers an abuse of power by the commissioners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Templeman continued (at 866H – 867B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In principle I see no reason why the appellant
should not be entitled to judicial review of a decision taken by
the commissioners if that decision is unfair to the appellant because
the conduct of the commissioners is equivalent to a breach of contract
or a breach of representation. Such a decision falls within the
ambit of an abuse of power for which in the present case judicial
review is the sole remedy and an appropriate remedy. There may be
cases in which conduct which savours of breach of conduct [<em>sic</em>] or breach of representation does
not constitute an abuse of power; there may be circumstances in
which the court in its discretion might not grant relief by judicial
review notwithstanding conduct which savours of breach of contract or
breach of representation. In the present case, however, I consider
that the appellant is entitled to relief by way of judicial review
for "unfairness" amounting to abuse of power if the commissioners
have been guilty of conduct equivalent to a breach of contract or
breach of representations on their part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Thus,
with respect to substantive relief where no existing legal right was
alleged to have been infringed, there were at least three doctrines
(or variations thereof) at play: legitimate expectation, estoppel
and abuse of power. I shall next consider how some common law jurisdictions
have dealt with these doctrines.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     
          <em>Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department,
Ex parte Ruddock and others</em> [1987] 1 WLR 1482 (“<em>Ex p Ruddock</em>”) was the first case to state
expressly that the doctrine of legitimate expectation could not
be restricted to cases involving the right to be heard.  An active
and prominent member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament had
his phone tapped. He alleged that this was not done in accordance
with the criteria for the interception of communications which had
been published on six occasions. The court dismissed the application
on the facts but relied on Lord Frasier’s speech in the <em>GCHQ</em> case (see [73] above) in stating
(at 1497A – B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst most of the cases are concerned,
as Lord Roskill said, with a right to be heard, I do not think the
doctrine is so confined. Indeed, in a case where ex hypothesi there
is no right to be heard, it may be thought the more important to
fair dealing that a promise or undertaking given by a minister as
to how he will proceed should be kept. Of course such promise or
undertaking must not conflict with his statutory duty or his duty,
as here, in the exercise of a prerogative power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In
the House of Lords decision of <em>Regina (Reprotech
(Pebsham) Ltd) v East Sussex County Council</em> [2003] 1
WLR 348, a purchaser of a waste treatment plant, with a view to
using waste to generate electricity, consulted the county planning
officer who said that generating electricity on the plant on a 24-hour
basis would not amount to a material change of use requiring planning
permission. Some years after the purchase, the purchaser was told that
planning permission was actually required. Relief was denied on
the facts. Lord Hoffman spoke for a unanimous House of Lords:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    In
any case, I think that it is <b>unhelpful to introduce
private law concepts of estoppel into planning law</b>. As
Lord Scarman pointed out in Newbury District Council v Secretary
of State for the Environment [1981] AC 578, 616, estoppels bind
individuals on the ground that it would be unconscionable for them
to deny what they have represented or agreed. But <b>these
concepts of private law should not be extended into "the public
law of planning control, which binds everyone"</b>. (See
also Dyson J in R v Leicester City Council, Ex p Powergen UK Ltd
[2000] JPL 629, 637.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    There is of course an analogy between
a private law estoppel and the public law concept of <b>a legitimate expectation created by a public authority, the
denial of which may amount to an abuse of power</b>: see
R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan [2001]
QB 213. But it is no more than an analogy because remedies against
public authorities also have to take into account the interests
of the general public which the authority exists to promote. Public
law can also take into account the hierarchy of individual rights
which exist under the Human Rights Act 1998, so that, for example,
the individual's right to a home is accorded a high degree of protection
(see Coughlan's case, at pp 254-255) while <b>ordinary
property rights are in general far more limited by considerations
of public interest</b>: see R (Alconbury Developments Ltd)
v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions
[2001] 2 WLR 1389.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    It is true that in early cases such
as the Wells case [1967] 1 WLR 1000 and Lever Finance Ltd v Westminster
(City) London Borough Council [1971] 1 QB 222, Lord Denning MR used
the language of estoppel in relation to planning law. <b>At that time the public law concepts of abuse of
power and legitimate expectation were very undeveloped and no doubt
the analogy of estoppel seemed useful.</b> In the Western
Fish case [1981] 2 All ER 204 the Court of Appeal tried its best
to reconcile these invocations of estoppel with the general principle
that a public authority cannot be estopped from exercising a statutory
discretion or performing a public duty. But the results did not
give universal satisfaction: see the comments of Dyson J in the Powergen
case [2000] JPL 629, 638. <b>It seems to me that
in this area, public law has already absorbed whatever is useful
from the moral values which underlie the private law concept of
estoppel and the time has come for it to stand upon its own two
feet.</b></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The
Court of Appeal, in the subsequent case of <em>South
Bucks District Council v Flanagan and another</em> [2002]
1 WLR 2601 (decided later than the above case but reported earlier),
construed the foregoing passage (at [16]) as the House of Lords
deciding that “there is no longer a place for the private law doctrine
of estoppel in public law or for the attendant problems which it
brings with it.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     
          <em>The Queen on the application of, Bhatt Murphy (a
firm) and others v The Independent Assessor</em> [2008] EWCA
Civ 755 concerned a group of individuals and solicitors who had
been denied access to a compensation scheme run by the government.
The Court of Appeal denied relief on the facts but Law LJ commented
on the underlying basis of the doctrine of legitimate expectation
(at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Legitimate expectation of either kind may
(not must) arise in circumstances where a public decision-maker
changes, or proposes to change, an existing policy or practice. <b>The doctrine will apply in circumstances where the change
or proposed change of policy or practice is held to be unfair or
an abuse of power</b>: see for example Ex p Coughlan paragraphs
67 ff, Ex p Begbie [2000] 1 WLR 1115, 1129F — H. The court is generally
the first, not the last, judge of what is unfair or abusive; its
role is not confined to a back-stop review of the primary decision-maker's
stance or perception: see in particular Ex p Guinness Plc [1990]
1 QB 146. Unfairness and abuse of power march together: see (in
addition to Coughlan and Begbie) Preston [1985] AC 835, Ex p Unilever
[1996] STC 681, 695 and Rashid [2005] INRL 550 paragraph 34. But
these are ills expressed in very general terms; and it is notorious
(and obvious) that the ascertainment of what is or is not fair depends
on the circumstances of the case. The excoriation of these vices
no doubt shows that the law's heart is in the right place, but it
provides little guidance for the resolution of specific instances.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     There
is no doubt that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
is part of English law. The Court of Appeal decision of <em>Regina (Patel) v General Medical Council</em> [2013]
1 WLR 2801 (“<em>Patel v GMC</em>”) is the
latest pronouncement on the law as it currently stands in England.
The case pertained to a medical doctor who received e-mail assurances
that, upon completion of a distance learning pre-clinical course
from a particular university, he would be provisionally registered
as a doctor with the General Medical Council (“GMC”). The GMC subsequently
told the claimant that his primary medical qualification was unacceptable
and denied provisional registration. The Court of Appeal granted
substantive relief on the ground of substantive legitimate expectation
and declared that the GMC was compelled to recognise the claimant’s
primary medical qualification for the purposes of registration.
The court utilised the following framework:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
statement or representation relied upon as giving rise to a legitimate
expectations must be “clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant
qualification” (at [40]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
party seeking to rely on the statement or representation must have
placed all his cards on the table (at [41]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     While
detrimental reliance is not a condition precedent, its presence
may be an influential consideration in determining what weight should
be given to the legitimate expectation (at [84]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
statement or representation must be pressing and focused. While
in theory there is no limit to the number of beneficiaries, in reality
the number is likely to be small as</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_82-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       It is difficult to imagine a case in which government will be
held legally bound by a representation or undertaking made generally
or to a diverse class; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_82-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The broader the class claiming the benefit of the expectation
the more likely it is that a supervening public interest will be
held to justify the change of position (at [50]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
burden of proof lies on the applicant to prove the legitimacy of
his expectation. Once this is done the onus shifts to the respondent to
justify the frustration of the legitimate expectation. It is for
the authority to identify any overriding interest on which it relies
to justify the frustration of the expectation (at [58]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
court has to decide for itself whether there is a sufficient overriding
interest to justify a departure from what has been previously promised
(at [60]). In doing so the court must weigh the competing interests.
The degree of intensity of review will vary from case to case, depending
on the character of the decision challenged (at [61]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It
is clear that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
is part of English law. It appears that the doctrine of estoppel
has been subsumed under the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Australia
has hitherto not recognised the doctrine of estoppel in the context
of public law (<em>Annetts and another v McCann
and others</em> (1990) 97 ALR 177 at 184, cited with approval
in <em>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural
Affairs; Ex parte Lam</em> (2003) 72 ALD 613 (“<em>Ex p Lam”</em>) at [69])</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     
          <em>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh</em> (1995)
183 CLR 353 (“<em>Teoh</em>”) was a High
Court of Australia case which held that a legitimate expectation
arose from the ratification of an international treaty that had
not been implemented by statute. The court held that ratification was
not an ineffectual act. It was a positive statement by the executive
that its agencies will act in accordance with the treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     However,
the subsequent High Court of Australia case of <em>Ex
p Lam</em> has cast doubt on <em>Teoh</em>.
In that case, the applicant was granted a transitional (permanent)
visa. He was convicted of trafficking heroin. An officer from the
Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs advised the applicant
that his visa might be cancelled. The applicant was told that he would
be provided with an opportunity to comment and was advised of the matters
to be taken into account, including the best interests of any children with
whom he was involved. The applicant responded and included a statement
from the carer of the applicant’s children. An officer subsequently
wrote to the applicant requesting contact details of the children’s
carer and stating that the respondent wished to contact the carer in
order to assess the applicant’s relationship with his children.
The applicant duly provided the contact details. However, no further
steps were taken to contact the carer and the applicant’s visa was
subsequently cancelled by the respondent. In four concurring judgments,
the applicant’s appeal for substantive relief was dismissed. Two
of the speeches did not consider the doctrine of legitimate expectation
but merely held that there was no denial of procedural fairness
on the facts. I turn now to the two speeches which touched on the
doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     McHugh
and Gummow JJ observed that the notion of “abuse of power” as applied
in England appeared to be concerned with the judicial supervision
of administrative decision-making by the application of certain minimum
standards and that it represented an attempted assimilation of doctrines
derived from European civil systems (at [73]) into the English common
law. However, civil systems are characterised by a close connection
between the administrative and judicial functions, with administrative
judges having administrative training and being alive to realities
of administration (at [74]). Further, Australia has a written federal constitution
with separation of power and judicial power does not extend to the
executive function of administration (at [76]). In the light of developments
in Australian case law of the requirements of procedural fairness,
the doctrine of legitimate expectation does not have any distinct role
(at [81]). The doctrine should be understood as being synonymous with
natural justice as merely indicating “the factors and kinds of factors which
are relevant to any consideration of what are the things which must be
done or afforded”. If natural justice does not condition the exercise
of power, the notion of legitimate expectation can have no role
to play. Otherwise, the doctrine would “become a stalking horse
for excesses of judicial power” (at [82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Callinan
J opined that the expression “legitimate expectation” is unfortunate
and misleading. The necessity for the invention of the doctrine is
questionable; the law of natural justice has evolved without the
need for recourse to any fiction of “legitimate expectation” (at
[140]). When Lord Denning MR first articulated the expression, he
was doing no more than using it as a synonym for a right or interest.
“Legitimate expectation” does not connote a freestanding or new
right altogether (at [141]). If “legitimate expectation” were to
remain part of Australian law, it would be better if it were applied
only in cases where there is an actual expectation (at [145]). On
any view, the doctrine of “legitimate expectation” gives rise to
only procedural rights and cannot give rise to substantive rights
(at [148]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A
3-2 majority of the judges in the High Court of Australia in <em>Ex p Lam</em> have thus held, albeit <em>obiter</em>, that the doctrine of legitimate
expectation is of questionable legitimacy and utility. <em>Rush v Commissioner of Police</em> (2006) 150
FCR 165 (at [75] and [82]) and <em>Habib v Commonwealth
(No 2)</em> (2009) 254 ALR 250 (at [70]) have subsequently
confirmed that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
is not recognised in Australian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Canada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The
seminal case in Canada is the Supreme Court decision of <em>Centre hospitalier Mont-Sinaï c Québec (Ministre
de la Santé &amp; des Services sociaux)</em> [2001] 2 SCR
281 (“<em>Mount Sinai</em>”).  The respondent,
Mount Sinai Hospital, originally dealt primarily with tuberculosis
patients and only had long-term care facilities. They decided to
move from Quebec to Montreal. The hospital had, by that time, both
short-term and long-term beds and wanted to alter its permit to
reflect this. The ministry promised to alter the permit after the
move to Montreal and this was reaffirmed by successive ministers.
The hospital moved and applied for its permit to be amended. However,
its application was denied on the basis that it was no longer in
the public interest to have short-term beds. The court unanimously
held that the Minister was compelled to issue the amended permit.
There were two speeches. Bastarache J (with whom L'Heureux-Dubé,
Gonthier, Iacobucci, and Major JJ concurred) did not touch on the
doctrine of legitimate expectation. McLachlin CJC and Binnie J,
in <em>obiter</em>, held that legitimate expectation
cannot be used to ground substantive relief and that the doctrine
of estoppel (which has more stringent requirements) should be used
to ground substantive relief instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     McLachlin
CJC and Binnie J opined that the doctrine of legitimate expectation,
as applied in England, performs a number of functions that are kept
distinct in Canada (at [24]). The doctrine has, in their view, developed into
a comprehensive code that embraces the full gamut of administrative relief,
from procedural fairness to estoppel (not properly so-called) (at [26]).
At the high end, this represents a level of judicial intervention
that the Canadian courts have considered inappropriate (unless constitutional rights
are implicated) (at [27]). Canadian cases have differentiated procedural
fairness and legitimate expectation (at [28]). If the courts are
to grant substantial relief, more demanding conditions precedent
must be fulfilled than are presently required by the doctrine of
legitimate expectation (at [32]). There are two further limitations:
first, a purely ministerial decision, on broad grounds of public
policy, will typically afford the individual no procedural protection
unless there has been an abuse of discretion (at [33]); secondly,
public bodies exercising legislative functions may not be amenable
to judicial supervision (at [34]). However, estoppel may be available
against a public authority in narrow circumstances (at [39]). In
this respect (at [42]),</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is to be emphasized that the requirements
of estoppel go well beyond the requirements of the doctrine of legitimate
expectations. As mentioned, the doctrine of legitimate expectations
does not necessarily, though it may, involve personal knowledge
by the applicant of the conduct of the public authority as well
as reliance and detriment. Estoppel clearly elevates the evidentiary
requirements that must be met by an applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The
doctrine of estoppel in the public law milieu, however, requires an
appreciation of the legislative intent embodied in the power whose exercise
is sought to be estopped. Therefore, circumstances that might otherwise
create an estoppel may have to yield to an overriding public interest
expressed in the legislative text (at [47]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The
latest pronouncement of the law as it currently stands in Canada is
contained in the 2013 Supreme Court case of <em>Agraira
v Canada (Minster of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em> (2013)
CarswellNat 1983. In a unanimous judgment, the court reaffirmed
the principle that the doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot
give rise to substantive rights (at [97]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     To
sum up, Canadian law does not grant substantive relief via the doctrine
of legitimate expectations. Instead, an applicant seeking substantive
relief would have to rely on the doctrine of estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Hong Kong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In <em>Ng Siu Tung &amp; others v Director of Immigration</em> [2002]
1 HKLRD 561, the Court of Final Appeal emphatically held that the
doctrine of legitimate expectation can be a ground for substantive
relief. The case concerned constitutional challenges to certain
amendments made to the Immigration Ordinance. There were over 5000
claimants who made applications for legal aid to commence proceedings;
in order to reduce the number of cases and costs, several cases
were chosen for a determination by the court of the common issues.
The government generally represented to the public that it would
abide by the decisions of the courts. Some applicants received <em>pro forma</em> replies that the government
would abide by the decisions of the courts and that it was unnecessary
to join in existing proceedings or commence fresh proceedings. The
cases were successful in impugning the constitutionality of the
amendments. Legislation was then promulgated which prospectively
reversed the successful cases. The legislation expressly stated
that it did not affect rights of abode which had been acquired pursuant
to the judgments. The issue at stake was whether the applicants
in the instant case were entitled to the acquired rights of abode,
in the sense of them being in the same position as the successful parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The
Court of Final Appeal granted relief on the ground of substantive legitimate
expectation but only for the applicants who received specific representations
in <em>pro forma</em> replies that it was
unnecessary for them to join in existing proceedings or commence
fresh proceedings. The entire court agreed that the doctrine of
substantive legitimate expectation was part of Hong Kong law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Li
CJ, Chan and Riberio PJJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, speaking for
a 4-1 majority, utilised the following framework:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doctrine of substantive legitimate
expectations recognizes that, in the absence of any overriding reason
of law or policy excluding its operation, situations may arise in
which persons may have a legitimate expectation of a substantive
outcome or benefit, in which event failing to honour the expectation
may, in particular circumstances, result in such unfairness to individuals
as to amount to an abuse of power justifying intervention by the court
(at [92]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    A
legitimate expectation arising from a promise or representation
made by or on behalf of a public authority must be taken into account
in the decision-making process so long as to do so falls within
the power of the decision-maker (at [92] and [94]).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Generally speaking, a representation
must be clear and unambiguous; if a representation is susceptible
to multiple interpretations, the interpretation applied by the public
authority will be adopted (this interpretation is subject to <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness) (at [104]).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    The question of whether reliance is
required was left open (at [109]). However, no issue as to reliance
occurs if the representations are calculated to induce reliance
(at [110]).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Unless there are reasons recognised
by law for not giving effect to legitimate expectations, then effect
should be given to them. Fairness requires the decision-maker to
give reasons if effect is not given to the expectation, so that
such reasons may be tested in court (at [95]).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    Even if the decision involves the
making of a political choice with reference to policy considerations,
the decision-maker must make the choice in the light of the legitimate
expectation of the parties (at [96]). If the decision-maker does
not take into account the legitimate expectation, the decision constitutes
an abuse of power and will usually be vitiated by reason of failure
to take account of a relevant consideration (at [97]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     
          <em>UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp</em> [2011]
3 SLR 94 (“<em>UDL Marine</em>”) concerned
a case where a tenant applied unsuccessfully to its landlord, a
statutory board, for the renewal of a lease. The application for leave
for judicial review was dismissed on the ground that the respondent’s act
of not renewing the lease was not susceptible to judicial review
because it was exercising its <em>private</em> contractual
rights not to renew the lease. Lai Siu Chiu J commented, <em>obiter</em>, that both parties had not submitted
on the issue of legitimate expectation. Nevertheless, she doubted
that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation was part
of Singapore law because of the presence of competing tensions and
her concern that the need to check against inconsistent treatment
must be balanced against the undesirable effects of excessively
fettering administrative discretion (at [65] and [66]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In <em>Borissik Svetlana v Urban Redevelopment Authority</em> [2009]
4 SLR(R) 92 (“<em>Borissik Svetlana</em>”),
the applicant was a joint owner of a semi-detached house who applied
for leave for judicial review of the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s
decision to deny the applicant’s application for the construction
of a detached bungalow. Leave was denied on the ground that the
applicant had not exhausted all her remedies before applying for judicial
review. Tan Lee Meng J nevertheless found, <em>obiter</em>,
that the applicant could not point to any promise made to her by
a person with actual or ostensible authority. Tan J went on to state
(at [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>De Smith’s Judicial
Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) lists four conditions
for the creation of a legitimate expectation, namely that the expectation
must be:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    clear,
unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   induced by the conduct of the decision
maker;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   made by a person with actual or
ostensible authority; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   applicable to the applicants, who
belong to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably
expected to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is unclear if Tan J was referring to a procedural or substantive
legitimate expectation. However, at [46], Tan J said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, the applicant's claim that she
had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop No 2
would be approved <b>will be considered</b>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above passage seems to suggest that Tan J had procedural,
rather than substantive, legitimate expectation in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The
Court of Appeal case of <em>Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011]
2 SLR 1189 (“<em>Yong Vui Kong</em>”) concerned
an appellant who was convicted of a drug trafficking offence and
sentenced to death. In a concurring judgment, Andrew Phang and V
K Rajah JJA addressed the appellant’s argument that a legitimate
expectation had arisen that it is the President who would make the
decision as to whether the appellant would be pardoned. Citing <em>Regina v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex parte Kebilene</em> [2000]
2 AC 326, they held that such a legitimate expectation could not
arise on the facts because clear statutory words will override any expectation.
In this respect, Art 22P(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of
Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) clearly states that the President shall
act “on the advice of the Cabinet”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Prior
case law has thus not addressed, head-on, the issue of whether the
doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore
law. Lai J in <em>UDL Marine</em> did not
have any submissions on this issue before her and doubted that the
doctrine existed. Tan J in <em>Borissik Svetlana</em> ostensibly had
procedural, rather than substantive, legitimate expectation in mind when
he cited a framework espoused in the sixth edition of <em>De Smith</em>. Andrew Phang and V K Rajah JJA
in <em>Yong Vui Kong</em> did not address
the issue of whether substantive legitimate expectation is part
of Singapore law. They dismissed the appellant’s argument on the
basis that no substantive legitimate expectation could have arisen
on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of respective submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The
applicant here relied chiefly on <em>Borissik Svetlana</em> for
the proposition that the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
has received implicit judicial recognition in Singapore. The applicant
submitted that Tan J had in that case assumed that judicial review
could be used to protection legitimate expectations of substantive
benefit. The applicant further contended that a legitimate expectation
arose on the facts. Firstly, the SLA Circulars and the SLA website
constituted clear and unambiguous representations that the DP would
be computed on the basis of the DC Table. Secondly, in deciding
whether to acquire the Land and in determining the appropriate price
it was willing to pay, the applicant was induced by the representations.
Thirdly, the SLA Circulars and the SLA website were circulated by
a person with actual or ostensible authority. Lastly, the applicant
belonged to the class of persons to whom the representations were
reasonably expected to apply. The applicant also argued that there
was no way for it to discover that the SLA had considered directly-alienated
land to be an exception to the prescribed method of assessment.
There was no publicly available document which stated that directly-alienated
land was an exception to the prescribed method of assessment. There
was in fact no way for the applicant to find out that the Land was
directly alienated to its former owner. The Land Return Clauses in
the two lease documents merely state that the DP would be payable
in accordance with the DP Clauses. The DP Clause is found in all
state leases and there is therefore nothing to disturb the applicant’s
understanding that the DP would be assessed in accordance with the
DC Table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The
SLA relied on <em>UDL Marine</em> for the
proposition that the High Court had, in that case, doubted the existence
of the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation in our law.
The SLA, however, conceded that local jurisprudence has not definitively
pronounced whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation
is part of Singapore law. The SLA submitted that the reasons for
and against the said doctrine are finely balanced. In England, the
doctrine is hedged with qualifications. Even then, the English approach
was categorically rejected by the Australian High Court in <em>Ex p Lam</em>, where the court found that the
English position did not sit well with the Australian constitutional
framework. The SLA also asserted that no expectations whatsoever
arose in this case. The threshold for a representation that is clear,
unambiguous and devoid of qualification is a high one. Further,
the applicant in fact already knew or ought to have known that the
DP in its case would be assessed via a spot valuation by the Chief
Valuer at 100% in enhancement in land value. There were media releases
concerning the redevelopment of a property located at Market Street.
Any reasonable developer would have noticed that the leases contained
a special covenant — the Land Return Clause — which is not ordinarily
found in other State leases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The
Attorney-General argued that the doctrine of substantive legitimate
expectation should not be adopted in Singapore for three reasons.
First, the doctrine was developed in England against the backdrop of
the Human Rights Act 1998 and the pressure to assimilate European doctrine
into the common law. Second, the underlying rationale of the doctrine
is that of abuse of power, which is not principled. Third, the doctrine
is inconsistent with the doctrine of separation of powers as enshrined
in the Singapore Constitution. In any event, no legitimate expectation
arose on the facts. There was no clear, unambiguous or unqualified
representation. The SLA Circulars were directed to the general public
and did not have the character of a contract. There was also no inducement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision on the doctrine
of legitimate expectation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The
above analysis (at [97] to [100]) shows that case law in Singapore has
not addressed directly the issue of whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate
expectations is part of Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The separation of powers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Both
the SLA and the Attorney-General placed especial emphasis on the
cases of <em>Ex p Lam</em> and <em>Mount Sinai</em>.  I shall deal with both cases
in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Both
the SLA and the Attorney-General relied on <em>Ex
p Lam</em> for the proposition that the doctrine of substantive
legitimate expectation was influenced by European law and is inconsistent
with the Australian Constitution and, more specifically, the separation
of powers. As Singapore and Australia both have written constitutions,
the reasoning in <em>Ex p Lam</em> also applies
to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    As
a preliminary matter, I note that this line of reasoning was present in
only McHugh and Gummow JJ’s speech and thus did not command the assent
of the majority of the court. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, in separate speeches,
did not consider the question of whether the doctrine of substantive
legitimate expectation ought to be part of Australian law. Callinan
J opined that the said doctrine is not part of Australian law but
did not cite the Australian Constitution and the separation of powers
as a reason for this holding (see [87] above). This line of reasoning
was also not adopted by the Canadian Supreme Court in <em>Mount Sinai.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Secondly,
although European law may have influenced English law, is the English
system of government, with its unwritten Constitution, fundamentally
different from the Singaporean and Australian systems of government
with their written Constitutions? Implicit in the SLA’s and the Attorney-General’s
argument is that a written constitution is a pre-requisite for the
separation of powers. According to this argument, the written constitutions
of Australia and Singapore explicitly demarcate the powers that
are to be allocated to the legislative, executive and judicial branches respectively
and it would therefore tantamount to judicial overreach for the judiciary
to enforce substantive legitimate expectations. However, it is clear that
the UK system, despite the absence of a written constitution, also recognises
the separation of powers. In the House of Lords decision of <em>Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department,
Ex parte Fire Brigades Union and others</em> [1995] 2 AC 513
(“<em>Ex p Fire Brigades</em>”), Lord Keith
of Kinkel said (at 567D – E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>It is a feature of
the peculiarly British conception of the separation of powers that
Parliament, the executive and the courts have each their distinct
and largely exclusive domain.</b> Parliament has a legally unchallengeable
right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries
on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred
on it by law. The courts interpret the laws, and see that they are obeyed. <em>This requires the courts on occasion to step into
the territory which belongs to the executive, to verify not only
that the powers asserted accord with the substantive law created
by Parliament but also that the manner in which they are exercised
conforms with the standards of fairness which Parliament must have
intended.</em> Concurrently with this judicial function Parliament
has its own special means of ensuring that the executive, in the
exercise of delegated functions, performs in a way which Parliament
finds appropriate. [emphasis added in bold and in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As
a side-note, this case was decided when the House of Lords was still
functioning as a court of law, 14 years before the establishment
of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009 which formalized
the separation of the legislative and the judicial functions of
the House of Lords in order to comply with the European Convention
on Human Rights. In this respect, I refer to a consultation paper
entitled <em>Constitutional Reform: A Supreme Court
for the United Kingdom</em> (July 2003, CP11/03) (available
at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf,
last accessed 28 October 2013) (at para 3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>It is not always understood
that the decisions of the ‘House of Lords’ are in practice decisions
of the Appellate Committee and that non judicial members of the
House never take part in the judgments. Nor is the extent to which
the Law Lords themselves have decided to refrain from getting involved
in political issues in relation to legislation on which they might later
have to adjudicate always appreciated.</b> The fact that
the Lord Chancellor, as the Head of the Judiciary, was entitled
to sit in the Appellate and Judicial Committees and did so as Chairman,
added to the perception that their independence might be compromised
by the arrangements. <em>The Human Rights Act,
specifically in relation to Article 6 of the European Convention
on Human Rights, now requires a stricter view to be taken not only of
anything which might undermine the independence or impartiality
of a judicial tribunal, but even of anything which might appear
to do so.</em> [emphasis added in bold and in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It
cannot be argued, therefore, that the doctrine of substantive legitimate
expectation should not be law in Singapore simply because Singapore
has a written constitution while England, which recognises the doctrine,
does not. Instead, this issue should be looked at from first principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    If
private individuals are expected to fulfil what they have promised, why
should a public authority be permitted to renege on its promises
or ignore representations made by it? If an individual or a corporation
makes plans in reliance on existing publicized representations made
by a public authority, there appears no reason in principle why
such reliance should not be protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The
upholding of legitimate expectations is eminently within the powers
of the judiciary. In the context of private law, this is expressed through
the enforcement of contracts (which upholds bargains freely made) and
the equitable doctrine of estoppel (which upholds the reliance interest of
a representee if a representor resiles from his representation inequitably). However,
in the public law sphere, in deciding whether a legitimate expectation
ought to be upheld, the court must remember that there are concerns
and interests larger than the private expectation of an individual or
a corporation. If there is a public interest which overrides the expectation,
then the expectation ought not to be given effect to. In this way,
I believe the judiciary can fulfil its constitutional role without arrogating
to itself the unconstitutional position of being a super-legislature or
a super-executive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In
my view, there ought to be no difference in principle between procedural
and substantive legitimate expectations. The reasons enumerated
above do not distinguish between the procedural and the substantive
and apply equally to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In
practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between the procedural and
substantive. This was acknowledged in <em>Mount
Sinai</em> (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In affirming that the doctrine of legitimate
expectations is limited to procedural relief, it must be acknowledged
that in some cases it is difficult to distinguish the procedural
from the substantive. In Bendahmane v. Canada, supra, for example,
a majority of the Federal Court of Appeal considered the applicant's
claim to the benefit of a refugee backlog reduction program to be procedural
(p. 33) whereas the dissenting judge considered the claimed relief to
be substantive (p. 25). A similarly close call was made in Canada
(Attorney General) v. Canada (Commissioner of the Inquiry on the
Blood System), [1996] 3 F.C. 259 (T.D.). An undue focus on formal
classification and categorization of powers at the expense of broad
principles flexibly applied may do a disservice here. The inquiry
is better framed in terms of the underlying principle mentioned
earlier, namely that broad public policy is pre-eminently for the
Minister to determine, not the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The
SLA and the Attorney-General referred, in particular, to [27] and [28]
of <em>Mount Sinai</em> to buttress their
argument that the doctrine of legitimate expectation should not
be recognised in Singapore. The two paragraphs cited are as follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    In
ranging over such a vast territory under the banner of "fairness",
it is inevitable that sub-classifications must be made to differentiate
the situations which warrant highly intrusive relief from those
which do not. Many of the English cases on legitimate expectations
relied on by the respondents, at the low end, would fit comfortably
within our principles of procedural fairness. At the high end they
represent a level of judicial intervention in government policy
that our courts, to date, have considered inappropriate in the absence of
a successful challenge under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    Canadian cases tend to differentiate
for analytical purposes the related concepts of procedural fairness
and the doctrine of legitimate expectation. There is, on the one
hand, a concern that treating procedural fairness as a subset of
legitimate expectations may unnecessarily complicate and indeed inhibit
rather than encourage the development of the highly flexible rules
of procedural fairness: D. Wright, "Rethinking the Doctrine of Legitimate Expectations
in Canadian Administrative Law" (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 139.
On the other hand, there is a countervailing concern that using
a Minister's prior conduct against him as a launching pad for substantive
relief may strike the wrong balance between private and public interests,
and blur the role of the court with the role of the Minister.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The
two paragraphs, read in isolation, seem to suggest that substantive
relief is denied as a matter of course because of a perceived need to
rein in inappropriate judicial intervention and that the doctrine
of legitimate expectations has no place in Canadian law. The procedural aspect
of the doctrine is better analysed as a matter of procedural fairness, while
the substantive aspect is better analysed as a matter of promissory estoppel.
However, at [31], McLachlin CJC and Binnie J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is difficult at one and the same time
thus to lower the bar to the application of the doctrine of legitimate
expectation (for good policy reasons) but at the same time to expand
greatly its potency for overruling the Minister or other public
authority on matters of substantive policy. One would normally expect more
intrusive forms of relief to be accompanied by more demanding evidentiary
requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court proceeded to state that promissory estoppel is available
against a public authority. Promissory estoppel is to be preferred
to legitimate expectations because the requirements for granting
relief under promissory estoppel are more stringent than those for
legitimate expectations (at [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is to be emphasized that the requirements
of estoppel go well beyond the requirements of the doctrine of legitimate
expectations. <b>As mentioned, the doctrine of
legitimate expectations does not necessarily, though it may, involve
personal knowledge by the applicant of the conduct of the public authority
as well as reliance and detriment.</b> Estoppel clearly elevates
the evidentiary requirements that must be met by an applicant. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The
difference between the two doctrines would therefore appear to be
the requirements of proof of an applicant’s personal knowledge together with
actual reliance and detriment. The Canadian court was therefore
not denying substantive relief altogether but was amenable to granting
it in a less liberal fashion, with an applicant having to prove
certain matters to the satisfaction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The doctrine and its requirements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In
my opinion, the doctrine of legitimate expectation should be recognised
in our law as a stand-alone head of judicial review and substantive
relief should be granted under the doctrine subject to certain safeguards.
Having regard to the case law from the various common law jurisdictions
and applying some commonsensical principles, I believe the doctrine
can operate effectively and fairly in the following manner without the
court overstepping its judicial role:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
applicant must prove that the statement or representation made by
the public authority was unequivocal and unqualified;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       If the statement or representation is open to more than one
natural interpretation, the interpretation applied by the public
authority will be adopted; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The presence of a disclaimer or non-reliance clause would cause
the statement or representation to be qualified.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
applicant must prove the statement or representation was made by
someone with actual or ostensible authority to do so on behalf of
the public authority;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
applicant must prove that the statement or representation was made
to him or to a class of persons to which he clearly belongs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the
statement or representation in the circumstances of his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       If the applicant knew that the statement or representation was
made in error and chose to capitalize on the error, he will not
be entitled to any relief;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Similarly, if he suspected that the statement or representation
was made in error and chose not to seek clarification when he could
have done so, he will not be entitled to any relief;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       If there is reason and opportunity to
make enquiries and the applicant did not, he will not be entitled
to any relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
applicant must prove that he did rely on the statement or representation
and that he suffered a detriment as a result;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_119-p2_f"></a>(f)     Even
if all the above requirements are met, the court should nevertheless
not grant relief if:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       Giving effect to the statement or representation will result in
a breach of the law or the State’s international obligations;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_f-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Giving effect to the statement or representation will infringe
the accrued rights of some member of the public;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_119-p2_f-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The public authority can show an overriding
national or public interest which justifies the frustration of the
applicant’s expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the doctrine’s
requirements to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I
shall first deal with the statements or representations set out
in the SLA website. The use of the website is governed by its Terms
of Use (see [9] above) which explicitly state that “the SLA does
not make any representations or warranties whatsoever” including
“any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, completeness,
reliability, timeliness, currentness, quality or fitness for any
particular purpose of the Contents of this Site”. The representations
set out in the SLA website were therefore qualified and cannot found
a claim for substantive relief under the doctrine of legitimate
expectation. Faced with such a wide disclaimer, the applicant should
have written to the SLA to confirm its alleged understanding of
how the policy would work in practice and, more specifically, how
it would impact the particular transaction that the applicant was
contemplating getting into. It did not do so and cannot now claim
relief under the doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I
next consider the SLA Circulars. The SLA Circulars were circulated to
the public at large. However, realistically speaking, the only people
who would have read (or would be expected to read) the SLA Circulars
were property developers or their advisors. The applicant, a property
developer, is clearly within the class of persons that the SLA Circulars
were targeted at.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The
SLA Circulars did contain unequivocal and unqualified statements
or representations. The 2000 SLA Circular stated that the “determination
of DP will be based on the published [DC Table] rates”. The 2007
SLA Circular reiterated this by its statement that the “determination
of DP will still be based on the published [DC Table] rates”. Both
circulars also enumerated certain exceptions to the applicability
of DC Table: where the use as spelt out in the particular title
restriction does not fit into any of the use groups and where the
lease tenure is upgraded (only the 2000 Circular).  The two Circulars
stated that the SLA reserves the right to determine if title restrictions
should be lifted. However this does not mean that the SLA also reserves
the further right to deviate from the DC Table if title restrictions are
indeed lifted. Both Circulars did not state that there might be
other unpublished exceptions or policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    There
was no dispute that the SLA Circulars and the SLA website were published
by or with the authority of the SLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The
applicant must prove that it was reasonable for him to rely on the statement
or representation. The applicant must also prove that he did rely on
the statement or representation and that he suffered a detriment
as a result. The applicant averred that it had relied upon the representation
in the SLA Circulars that DC Table rates would apply in purchasing
the land. It would appear therefore that reliance was placed on
the SLA’s publications and if the applicant now has to pay a much
higher DP than was represented, there would definitely be detriment
caused to the applicant. However, was it reasonable for the applicant
to have relied on the SLA’s publications in the circumstances of
this case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The
Land Return Clause (present in the leases of both Plots) (see [4] above)
provided that the applicant as lessee was obliged to notify the
lessor, the Singapore Government, if the land in question was not
used for the purposes specified. Upon notification, the Government
would have a year to decide whether or not to buy over the land
at Land Acquisition Act (Cap 152, 1985 Rev Ed) rates. Such rates
might turn out to be lower than the price which the land would have
fetched in the market, simply because potential purchasers would
have paid a higher price in the anticipation of getting approval
for a change of the use of the land or for an increase in the plot
ratio. In particular, s 33(5)(<em>e</em>)
of the Land Acquisition Act explicitly states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the market value of the acquired land shall
be deemed not to exceed the price which a bona fide purchaser might
reasonably be willing to pay, after taking into account the zoning
and density requirements and any other restrictions imposed by or
under the Planning Act (Cap. 232) as at the date of acquisition and
any restrictive covenants in the title of the acquired land, and <b>no account shall be taken of any potential value
of the land for any other use more intensive than that permitted
by or under the Planning Act as at the date of acquisition.</b> [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The applicant in purchasing the Land took upon itself the
risk of compulsory acquisition which, if it had occurred, could
have resulted in a huge loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The
SLA furnished evidence that the Land Return Clause was present in
only 242 State leases, representing only 1.25% of the total number
of State leases. The applicant, an experienced property developer,
would have known that the Land Return Clause was peculiar and atypical
of State leases. The applicant tried to understate this by arguing
that the Land Return Clause merely referred back to the DP Clause
for the computation of the DP payable and that it was therefore
unaware of the significance of the Land Return Clause. I was not
convinced by this. The Land Return Clause should have alerted an
experienced property developer like the applicant to the fact that
the Land was not under a “normal” State lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    It
was widely reported in the local media in 2008 that Capitaland had to
pay a DP equivalent to 100% of the enhancement in land value to redevelop
the Market Street Car Park. At the hearing, the applicant tried
to downplay this by saying that it understood 100% of the enhancement
in land value to mean 100% of the enhancement in land value as indicated
by the DC Table (because the convention after the 2007 SLA Circular
was to charge 70%, an increase from the 50% payable under the 2000
SLA Circular). I accept that the local media reports did not state
the method upon which the 100% enhancement in value was calculated.
However, the press release by Capitaland on 3 January 2008 (almost
two years before Lot 1338M was acquired), stated that the said redevelopment
was subject to two conditions, one of which was “the payment by
the lessee (CCT) of 100% of the enhancement in land value as assessed
by the Chief Valuer in a spot valuation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Considering
the evidence cumulatively, the irresistible inference is that the
applicant ought to have known that the DP for the Land would not be
assessed according to the DC Table. At the very least, the applicant should
have written to the SLA to ask if DC Table rates would be applied
to State leases which contain the Land Return Clause, especially
in the light of the widely-reported Market Street Car Park redevelopment.
In fact, the applicant started construction work sometime after
8 April 2011 and before the SLA letter dated 29 November 2011, where
the SLA first approved the lifting of title restrictions and stated
that the DP would be assessed at 100% of the enhancement in land
value in a spot valuation. The construction costs could very easily
have been incurred for nothing had the SLA not given approval for
the lifting of title restrictions in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    As
an experienced property developer going into a multi-million dollar
transaction, it was therefore not reasonable for the applicant to
have relied solely on the SLA’s publications in the circumstances
of this case. It was in the business of making money from land development.
It had many professional advisors and could have easily checked
with the SLA on what the DP would be if it decided to buy the Land
and embark on its redevelopment plans. In any case, the SLA had
made it clear in its correspondence with the applicant that the
DP was assessed without reference to the DC Table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Assuming
that the applicant had satisfied the first five requirements (which
it clearly had not) for invoking the doctrine of legitimate expectation
to claim relief, there would still be the safeguards in the sixth requirement
to consider. As the SLA has rightfully pointed out, it is under
a statutory duty to “optimise land resources” (s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SLA Act) and to “have regard
to efficiency and economy and to the social, industrial and commercial
and economic needs of Singapore” in the carrying out of its functions
(s 6(2)(<em>a</em>) of the SLA Act). Its
statutory duty would encompass getting the best returns for the
State when it deals with State land. This would in turn benefit
the public at large. It is therefore unacceptable in the circumstances
here to argue that the State’s finances would not suffer as much
as the applicant’s if the SLA were to make an exception for this
case and not apply its unpublished policy relating to directly-alienated
State land to the Land here. The overriding public interest must
therefore prevail over the financial interests of a commercial enterprise
like the applicant in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion and costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The
applicant has failed to show irrationality on the part of the SLA
or to establish a legitimate expectation on the facts of this case.
Accordingly, its application for judicial review on these grounds
is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The
applicant is to pay the costs of the SLA and of the Attorney-General,
such costs to be agreed or taxed. The parties may also agree that the
costs be fixed by me. In that event, I will fix the amount of costs
after hearing their submissions on the appropriate quantum to award.</p>
