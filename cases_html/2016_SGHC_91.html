</div> The Court of Appeal allowed the application and the first defendant has lodged a notice of appeal against the Costs Order. I thus set out the reasons for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual and procedural background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The trial to determine the assets belonging to the Chiang estate was heard in two tranches, the first in January 2014, and the second in July 2014. The action against the fifth defendant, in relation to the validity of a gift of a property to her under Clause 5 of the Will, was discontinued after the parties entered into the Consent Order on 16 January 2014, midway through Day 6 of the proceedings. The relevant portion of the Order is reproduced as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. There be no order as to costs with respect to the issue of Clause 5 of the Will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(“Point 7 of the Consent Order”)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 2 July 2014, shortly after the start of the second tranche, the plaintiff and the other four defendants entered into a settlement, which resulted in the Consent Judgment. Pursuant to Point 9 of the Consent Judgment that reserved the issue of costs to be decided by me, and after hearing the parties on costs, I made the Costs Order. As between the plaintiff and the defendants, I ordered the first defendant to pay 90% of the plaintiff’s costs and the second to fourth defendants to pay the remaining 10% of the plaintiff’s costs. As between the defendants, I ordered the first defendant to pay 70% of the costs of the second to fourth defendants. The costs were to be agreed or taxed on a standard basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Subsequently, at the taxation stage, the defendants could not agree as to the relative scope of the Costs Order in relation to Point 7 of the Consent Order. The first defendant sought a stay of the taxation proceedings <span class="font-italic">via</span> Summons No 902 of 2015 and an extension of time and leave to appeal against my Costs Order <span class="font-italic">via</span> Summons No 937 of 2015. The Senior Assistant Registrar directed parties to see me for a clarification of the Costs Order.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I heard parties on 18 August 2015 and clarified the Costs Order, whilst dismissing both the first defendant’s summons. The first defendant then applied to the Court of Appeal for leave and an extension of time to appeal against the whole of the Costs Order. On 2 February 2016, the Court of Appeal allowed the first defendant’s application on the grounds that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of error in the Costs Order when read with the Consent Order.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 I had previously issued Grounds of Decision in [2015] SGHC 110 arising out of the same case, but those Grounds of Decision related to the narrow and separate issue of whether my confirmation in February 2015 to the parties – that the distribution to the first defendant be made after the costs were determined – amounted to a variation of the Consent Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The two issues arising out of the Costs Order are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether my clarification of the Costs Order on 18 August 2015 amounted to a variation of Point 7 of the Consent Order; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the substance of my Costs Order was justified. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Clarification of the Costs Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I will first deal with my clarification of the Costs Order. My clarification of the Costs Order in August 2015, when taken in context, was not a variation of the Consent Order. When the action against the fifth defendant in relation to Clause 5 of the Will was discontinued, she did not ask for costs even though she had in fact succeeded on her position; her counsel indicated that she was not seeking costs orders against the plaintiff or the other defendants. In view of this concession, I did not order costs to be paid to her by the plaintiff or the other defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 However, Point 7 of the Consent Order merely resolved the costs issue between the fifth defendant and the remaining parties, and did <span class="font-italic">not</span> serve to resolve the costs issues among the other remaining parties arising from the dispute <span class="font-italic">between them</span> on the same issue. The remaining parties at that point were continuing with the trial, and all costs issues between them were only to be resolved at the end of the trial. In any case, it could not have been and was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the plaintiff’s position that she was forgoing the costs she incurred in relation to the Clause 5 issue as against the first to fourth defendants. As the plaintiff had taken the same position as the fifth defendant in relation to Clause 5, she had prevailed on this issue against the first to fourth defendants, and it would not have made sense for her to forgo the associated costs incurred when the trial was continuing between her and the first to fourth defendants. Any such concession would have made no sense at that stage of the proceedings, when the merits of the various other claims by the first to fourth defendants had not yet been resolved. My understanding was that at the point when the Consent Order was made, the remaining parties in the suit were not settling their costs relating to the issue of Clause 5 of the Will; the settlement on costs in the Consent Order could only have been in relation to the fifth defendant, who was the only party that was withdrawing from the litigation. Thus, when I made the Costs Order at the end of the entire action, my order included the unresolved costs incurred by the remaining parties in litigating the dispute on Clause 5 of the Will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 My clarification of the Costs Order in August 2015 thus did not vary the substance of Point 7 of the Consent Order: the effect was only to clarify the meaning of the Consent Order to the parties as they had failed to proceed with the taxation hearing due to the dispute over its terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On this issue, my decision is supported by the case of <span class="font-italic">Godfrey Gerald QC v UBS AG and others</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 411, where the Court of Appeal clarified certain terms of the costs order from an appeal, and the applicant applied, unsuccessfully, to set aside the order on the basis that the Court of Appeal was not in a position to clarify the purport of its costs order because it was already <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> when it gave its clarification. VK Rajah JC (as he then was) held (at [18]–[19]) that the Court of Appeal was not <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> when it clarified its costs order. The High Court and Court of Appeal retained a residual inherent jurisdiction under O 92 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) to clarify the terms of the order and/or to give consequential directions even after the order was pronounced. Rajah JC explained that the purpose of this residual inherent jurisdiction was to ensure that “the spirit of court orders are appropriately embodied and correctly reflected to the letter.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 My order in August 2015 was merely an exercise of this residual inherent jurisdiction, which remains enshrined in O 92 r 5 of the current Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”), to clarify the wording of the Consent Order, and ensure that the intent behind the Consent Order was fulfilled through its wording. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Basis for Costs Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It is necessary to compare the positions of the plaintiff and the five defendants before trial and after settlement in understanding the basis for the Costs Order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ positions before trial </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The plaintiff as sole executrix of the Will had brought the action to finalise the Schedule of Assets of the Chiang estate (“the Schedule”) by including in the Schedule the following assets:

She as sole executrix had brought the action to allow her to administer the estate properly. She was a trusted ex-employee of the deceased and was an independent party in the family strife. Despite the difficulties in administering the Chiang estate over the years, she stayed on out of gratitude to the deceased. In my view, the plaintiff was forced to bring this action. Given the acrimonious relationship between the beneficiaries, she acted reasonably in seeking court directions in dealing with the assets of the Chiang estate. She did not incur unnecessary costs for the estate or cause unnecessary costs to be incurred by the other parties in the conduct of this action. On the issues in dispute for which she had a position, she essentially prevailed, as is apparent from the terms of the Consent Judgment. The estate, through the plaintiff as executrix, had acted reasonably, so it would not be reasonable to expect the estate to bear its own costs. Instead, the defendants should be made to bear the estate’s costs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs of the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As for the first defendant, she was mostly unsuccessful in her claims against the second to fourth defendants and against the plaintiff.

The settlement of the action took place in circumstances that were indicative of likely defeat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The first defendant conducted her case unreasonably and without due regard to the rules and procedures of court, thereby causing the other parties in the litigation to incur unnecessary costs. She was insistent on cross-examining witnesses in areas that had little relevance to the issues in this action, despite several reminders from me and objections from counsels for the other parties. She spent a lengthy amount of time cross-examining the plaintiff on taxes paid on the estate’s properties, which bore little relevance to the present proceedings, despite reminders by me to focus on the relevant issues.

</div> In fact, counsel for the plaintiff was put in such a position that he offered to give her the requested papers in an attempt to redirect the focus of the trial to the relevant issues. In my view, the first defendant’s conduct in this respect quite plainly wasted the court’s time. This to me was an example of the first defendant using her status as a litigant in person to gain an unfair advantage – had counsel attempted to conduct cross-examination in such a manner on issues derived from a withdrawn application, he or she would not been given the same leeway.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The first defendant’s counterclaim for emotional distress also arose out of the same OS, the claim being that the plaintiff caused emotional distress to her by the joinder of the second to fourth defendants in the OS.

</div> This was a plainly unmeritorious claim: firstly, it bore no relevance to the issues in dispute before me, and secondly, the plaintiff appeared to have acted reasonably in joining the parties who possessed the information sought for by the first defendant in the OS. Again, the first defendant was making use of the proceedings before me to ventilate issues that should have been heard in other fora. It became very clear as the cross-examination continued that her counterclaim in this aspect would not succeed. True enough, the counterclaim was withdrawn on 2 July 2014. She also spent a substantial amount of time cross-examining the plaintiff on the basis that the plaintiff was biased and negligent in administering the Chiang estate.

This conduct made the proceedings unnecessarily protracted and wasted valuable court time. I sympathised with the plaintiff as she had done nothing to deserve this; she was an unrelated third party who had nothing to gain from siding with any of the defendants.

</div> Had counsel been instructed, he or she is unlikely to have thought fit to make such allegations during cross-examination. This was another example of the first defendant acting without due regard for the rules and procedures of court, and using her status as a litigant person unfairly to the prejudice of the others parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It is every layperson’s right to represent himself or herself without the aid of counsel. Justice requires that courts do not apply professional standards to litigants in person, who may be involved in a court proceeding for the only time in their lives. However, litigants in person are still subject to the same rules and procedure of court. Whilst the courts are cognisant of the fact that litigants in person are not legally trained, and are thus more indulgent of their mistakes, this does not mean that they can act without regard to these rules and procedures. In this respect, I am of the view that the first defendant’s conduct of the case left much to be desired. Ample leeway was given to her to conduct her case in the light of her status as a litigant in person; I also reminded her time and again, throughout the proceedings, to confine her case to the pleadings and to refrain from giving evidence and making submissions whilst cross-examining witnesses. However, these reminders clearly landed on deaf ears, as her behaviour did not improve and remained substantially the same throughout the proceedings. Had the first defendant engaged counsel, he or she would have been bound by rules of professional conduct and would not have been able to pursue the first defendant’s claims in the same manner. It was quite apparent that the first defendant had no issues affording legal representation, and I suggested to her several times to consider engaging counsel, but she refused. This refusal, coupled with the manner in which she conducted the trial, led me to infer that her choice to appear as a litigant in person was calculated to avail herself of a degree of leniency that the court would not give to counsel – he or she would have been unable to give evidence from the bar and continually disrupt other counsel or witnesses. So I find that the first defendant had behaved unreasonably, even when allowance is made for her inexperience and lack of objectivity; her actions caused the other parties in the litigation to incur unnecessary costs to respond to her allegations and in managing her disruptions. In my view, the first defendant had taken unfair advantage of the leeway given to her as a litigant in person and pursued her claims in a manner that was prejudicial to the other parties in the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I pause to clarify that I did not draw an adverse inference against the first defendant for not engaging counsel for the trial when she could afford to do so: her right to appear in person is quite absolute. However, her status as a litigant in person alone does not and cannot mean that she can conduct her case in an unreasonable manner that causes the other parties to incur unnecessary costs, and remain immune from adverse cost orders. I also note that the first defendant had taken a plainly unreasonable position with regard to certain interlocutory applications, for which she had already been ordered to pay costs to the other parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Taking into account the first defendant’s conduct of the proceedings, the terms of the Consent Judgment reflecting that she had failed on the merits of her various claims, and the relevant legal principles, I was of the view that she should bear 90% of the plaintiff’s costs and 70% of the second to fourth defendants’ costs. The issue of the order against her in relation to the second to fourth defendants’ costs will be explained further below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs of the second to fourth defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The second to fourth defendants submitted that they were entitled to costs from the first defendant on an indemnity basis under O 22A of the ROC as they had made a proposal to settle the trial to all parties, dated 23 August 2013, prior to the commencement of the trial.

<div class="txt-body text-justify">  Letter from counsel for the second to fourth defendants to the first defendant, the plaintiff’s counsel and the fifth defendant’s counsel dated 23 August 2013</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I was unable to apply O 22A in this case. First, O 22A is intended to apply as between plaintiffs and defendants, not among defendants. Second, the offer to settle did not follow the mandatory format of Form 33 of the ROC, so the first defendant as a litigant in person may not have been alerted to the cost consequences of not accepting the offer. Thus, I decided not to apply O 22A. However, in the exercise of my general discretion, I still took this offer into account as evidence of an attempt at resolving the dispute before it reached trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It appeared to me from the terms of the Consent Judgment that the second to fourth defendants prevailed to some extent on their positions, but were also unsuccessful in other aspects. They took the position that the Chiang estate was indebted to Chiang properties, which failed, judging by the terms of the settlement. They also took the position that Clause 5 of the Will was invalid, which was the one issue on which they were in agreement with the first defendant, but they failed. In these aspects, since the second to fourth defendants failed to prove their claims, they should be made to pay costs to the plaintiff, just like the first defendant. Given that a more substantial period of time was devoted to the ventilation of the first defendant’s counterclaims against the plaintiff, and that the second to fourth defendants did not bring counterclaims against the plaintiff, I was of the view that the second to fourth defendants should bear only 10% of the plaintiff’s costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  A substantial part of the proceedings was focused on the issue of the purported unauthorised transfers. This issue was raised by the first defendant, and the second to fourth defendants appeared to have prevailed thereon, judging by the terms of the Consent Judgment. On the issue of survivorship governing the Deposits, the second to fourth defendants also prevailed over the first defendant. I was thus of the view that the second to fourth defendants had largely prevailed over the first defendant on the issues, and should thus be awarded 70% of their costs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the reasons set out above, my clarification on 18 August 2015 was not a variation of the Consent Order, and the first defendant’s unreasonable conduct of the trial justified the Costs Order despite her status as a litigant in person. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Edmund Leow <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Soo Chye and Subir Singh Grewal (Aequitas Law LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>The first defendant in person;<br/> Balasubramaniam Ernest Yogarajah (UniLegal LLC) for the second, third and fourth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
