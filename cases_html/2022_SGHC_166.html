</div>  This may suggest that, when Julniee had her private conversation with Ruben in the accused’s room (during which the alleged sexual assault had taken place), the accused’s room door had been <span class="font-italic">open </span>and not shut as the complainant has testified (see [9] above).  However, I note that there is evidence to the contrary. <span class="font-italic"> </span>In an investigation statement recorded from Julniee on 28 April 2017, Julniee stated that after she had “talked to Ruben for a while”, the accused returned to his room to check if she and Ruben were done.  When she informed the accused that they were not done, the accused then closed his room door and left.

When Julniee was cross-examined by the Prosecution on this part of her investigation statement (see [29] below), she testified that she could not recall that the accused had returned to his room to check on her and Ruben and shut the room door.

</div>  The case for the Defence is that the accused’s semen might have been on the floor or wall of the Toilet, or on some other article of clothing in the laundry basket, and from there, the semen was transferred to the exterior back of the T-shirt.  That might have happened when the T-shirt came into contact with the floor or wall of the Toilet or some other article of clothing in the laundry basket.  The police had seized the T-shirt from the laundry basket in the service balcony area, when they searched the Flat in the early hours of 28 December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The other aspect of the accused’s evidence that bears mentioning is that he denied having admitted to Julniee or his parents on 27 December 2016 that he had “fingered” or kissed the complainant.  He disputed the account given by Julniee in the 28 Apr Statement that he had admitted to “fingering” the complainant.  He insisted that Julniee was trying to frame him.  As for her motive for doing so, the accused explained that he often acted in a controlling manner over Julniee by setting curfews for her and limiting how much alcohol she could drink.

His evidence is that he first learnt of the allegations against the accused when he came home from work on 27 December 2016, at about 7.00pm.  Julniee told him that the complainant was going to make a police report against the accused for having sexually assaulted her.

Given the evidence of the accused and the complainant, the only issue in contention in relation to these two charges is whether he had indeed sexually penetrated the complainant as she has alleged.  If the accused had indeed done so, it is not the Defence’s case that the complainant had consented to these acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, pursuant to which the accused been charged in respect of the third and fourth charges, reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 “Criminal force” is defined in s 350 of the Penal Code as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person’s consent, in order to cause the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force illegally to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will illegally cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 From these provisions, the elements of the third and fourth charges which the Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt are: (a) that the accused had used criminal force on the complainant; and (b) the accused intended by the use of such criminal force to outrage the modesty of the complainant.  It is not in dispute that the act of kissing the complainant’s lips and the touching of the complainant’s breast, both without her consent, constitute acts of criminal force, and if indeed so perpetrated by the accused, would have been intended by him to outrage the modesty of the complainant (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 890).  Thus, in respect of the third and fourth charges, the only issue before this court is whether the accused had indeed kissed her lips and touched her breast as the complainant has alleged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 An accused person can be convicted <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on a complainant’s testimony alone but only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]).  While the “unusually convincing” standard does not change the rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, it does set the threshold for the complainant’s testimony to be preferred over the accused’s evidence where the case is one that boils down to one person’s words against another’s (see <span class="font-italic">XP v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 (“<span class="font-italic">XP</span>”) at [31]).  The emphasis is on the sufficiency of the complainant’s testimony, and the threshold would be met only if the testimony, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”) at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 A witness’s testimony may only be found to be “unusually convincing” by weighing the demeanour of the witness alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’s testimony (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [115]).  The demeanour of the witness is not invariably determinative, and if the witness fails to recall or satisfactorily explain material facts and assertions, her credible demeanour cannot overcome such deficiencies (see <span class="font-italic">XP </span>at [71]).  Finally, even if the witness’s testimony is found to be “unusually convincing”, it does not automatically lead to a guilty verdict and does not dispense with the need for the court to consider the other evidence and the factual circumstances peculiar to each case, as well as the need to assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused’s (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [114(d)]).  An “unusually convincing” testimony does not overcome materially or inherently contradictory evidence (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [114(d)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 If the complainant’s testimony is not “unusually convincing”, then the accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s evidence (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]).  A liberal approach is adopted in determining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">Liton </span>at [43]).  There is no need for the corroborative evidence to consist of independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular, and what is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate (see <span class="font-italic">Liton </span>at [43]).  However, it is clear that subsequent repeated complaints by a complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [114(a)]; <span class="font-italic">XP </span>at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As I have mentioned earlier, the main question before this court is whether the complainant had indeed been sexually assaulted by the accused as she has alleged (see [61] and [64] above).  From the parties’ respective cases, there are two starkly conflicting accounts of events given by the complainant and the accused.  The task of the court is to weigh the evidence of the both of them against the various other pieces of evidence that have emerged in this case, in order to determine whether the Prosecution has successfully proven its case against the accused on the four charges beyond a reasonable doubt.  In carrying out this task, it appears to me that the court has to grapple with the following key issues: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the account of events given by the complainant as to the alleged sexual assaults is “unusually convincing”; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the relevance of Julniee’s evidence and her credibility as a witness; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the accused’s account stands up to scrutiny in the light of the evidence before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is to these issues that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of the complainant’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Prosecution’s case is that the complainant’s testimony is “unusually convincing”, although it also takes the position that the “unusually convincing” standard is not necessarily applicable in this case because the complainant’s evidence does not form the sole basis of their case against accused.  As corroboration, the Prosecution has referred to the evidence of the presence of the accused’s semen on the exterior back of the T-shirt, as well as Julniee’s evidence.

Having done so, I am unable to agree with the Defence’s submission that the complainant had not been able to positively identify the accused as her assailant during the time of the assaults.  Her evidence was candid and direct.  She was quite intoxicated at the time of the assaults.  As such, she did not get a good look at the face of the male person who had assaulted her.  In her memory, she had a blurred image of a face.  She agreed that she might not have seen her assailant’s face completely.  However, she did think from the voice and the build of the male person in question that the assailant was the accused.  In my judgment, it is clear from the complainant’s evidence that she had been able to positively identify the accused as the assailant during the time of the assaults based on what she could perceive of her assailant <span class="font-italic">then</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 According to the complainant, when she was first approached by the male person in the Toilet and brought out onto the sofa in the living room (see [8] above), she had “assumed” from the voice of the male person that he was the accused.

Thus, I find that there is no merit in the Defence’s submission that the complainant had not been able to positively identify the assailant during the assaults and only later came to assume that her assailant was the accused.  I also make an observation in respect of this part of the complainant’s testimony.  It is significant that, when the complainant was asked during evidence-in-chief whether she knew who her assailant was, her response had been that she “assumed” that her assailant was the accused based on, amongst other things, the fact that she had heard the <span class="font-italic">same</span> voice on all three occasions when she was in the Toilet asking her “[V], are you okay?”.  In my view, the complainant could easily have embellished her evidence to say that she saw the accused’s face and remembered it, and thus positively identified the accused as the assailant during those assaults.  However, I find that she was honest enough to admit that her eyes were closed for most of the time during the assaults, and she did not get a good look at who her assailant was.  She also testified that she had not blacked out, but had been conscious throughout as to what was happening to her, though she did not have the strength to resist the assailant.

</div>  In my view, the sentence where the complainant says that she did not know who the male person was must be read in its proper context.  I find that the complainant was simply explaining that she did not see who the person was because her eyes were not fully open, and as such, she could not say for sure that she knew that the assailant was the accused.  This in no way detracts from the evidence which she had given in court that, from the voice and the build of the male person, and the fact that the male person seemed to know her, she knew that it must have been the accused, even though she did not see his face clearly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The information which the complainant shared with [D] and [E] on the morning of 26 December 2016 about what had happened to her is also consistent with her having positively identified the accused as the assailant during the time of the assaults.

It is not the complainant’s evidence that she had identified the accused as the assailant <span class="font-italic">only</span> because of the voice of the male person who had approached her in the Toilet.

</div>  The complainant considered that this male person, who was able to call out her name, must have known her, yet he did not sound like Julniee’s father, nor did the build of this male person fit that of Julniee’s father.  The complainant therefore formed the view <span class="font-italic">then</span> that it could only have been the accused.  As such, even if I were to accept the Defence’s submission that the complainant was unfamiliar with the accused’s voice and so could not have recognised it, this in no way undermines the fact that there had been a series of reasons that led to the complainant forming the view that her assailant was the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 By the time the complainant gave her investigation statement, she had already identified the accused as her assailant.  That explains why the FIR stated that she had been “raped by a 22-year-old male”.  Also, shortly after the accused returned home in the early hours of 28 December 2016, he was placed under arrest and brought to the Police Cantonment Complex for further investigation under the instructions of ASP Tai.

</div>
</div>  As such, the proper context of the investigation statement is that she was being asked to recount the sexual assaults, and she did not have to specifically identify the accused in her statement, since she had already informed the police who had assaulted her.  No significance can therefore be attached to the complainant’s omission to specifically identify the accused as the assailant in the complainant’s investigation statement as identified by the Defence (see [80] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On the question of identification, another piece of evidence which has not been satisfactorily dealt with by the Defence is the complainant’s testimony that her assailant was wearing a dark blue-coloured shirt.  I reiterate that it is undisputed that the accused was wearing a dark blue-coloured shirt at the material time.  This part of the complainant’s testimony is therefore externally consistent.  The Defence argues that the complainant had embellished her evidence when she mentioned the dark blue-coloured shirt in her evidence-in-chief because this fact had not been mentioned in her earlier conversations with her friends, including Julniee.  However, I am not able to accept this submission because, in her conversations with her friends, it did not appear that she had been asked to describe the details of precisely what had happened, or what she had observed, and none of the complainant’s friends had questioned her claim that she had been sexually assaulted.  There was thus no reason for the complainant to point out to her friends that she saw her assailant wearing a dark blue-coloured shirt.  In her evidence-in-chief, however, she had to explain in minute detail, step-by-step, what happened, and what she could remember as to what she saw and heard.  That was when she mentioned that she saw her assailant was wearing a dark blue-coloured shirt.  I also noted that the Defence did not suggest to the complainant that she had embellished her evidence about having seen that her assailant was wearing a dark blue-coloured shirt.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 More fundamentally, though, I find that the Defence’s submission as to the identification of the accused does not really assist the court.  There were only four other male persons in the Flat at that time, and all of them, save for the accused, have been accounted for.  This is accepted by the Defence.  The accused’s father, Alson, was asleep in his bedroom with his wife.  Alex was asleep on the floor of the accused’s bedroom.  Ruben was in the accused’s room speaking to Julniee.  As such, the only male person who could have had the opportunity to assault the complainant, while she was out of Julniee’s sight, was the accused.  Further, it was the accused’s own evidence that he was the person who had approached the complainant in the Toilet and helped lift her up from the floor.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The internal and external consistency of the complainant’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Defence attacks the consistency of the complainant’s account of the sexual assaults (see [72] above), but I find the inconsistencies that have been pointed out to be rather immaterial.  Some of these inconsistencies include: (a) the complainant had mentioned to Dr Koh that there might have been a second kiss while she was on the sofa in the living room, contrary to her initial testimony during evidence-in-chief where she said that there had only been one kiss;

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I find that these minor inconsistencies do not detract from the fact that, from an overall assessment of the complainant’s evidence, she has been materially consistent when describing the account of the assaults, right down to the details as to what she could <span class="font-italic">not</span> remember.  Her account of the sexual assaults, from the time she was first brought out of the Toilet up to the time she was sexually penetrated in the anus after she returned to the Toilet for the second time, was largely unshaken under cross-examination.  What she told her friends, [D], [E], [F] and Julniee, a few hours after she was assaulted, was consistent with her evidence in court as to what transpired during the assault, in particular, that she had been sexually penetrated in the anus, and that the accused was the one who was responsible (see [81]-[82] above).  The evidence of these four friends confirms that the complainant’s account of the events that occurred never changed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Further, the omission of these somewhat peripheral facts by the complainant, whether while she was examined by Dr Koh or when her investigation statement was recorded, does not detract from my assessment that the complainant’s testimony has been materially consistent.  The proper context in which the complainant had been asked to provide those accounts (whether to Dr Koh or ASP Tai) should be borne in mind (see also [85] above).  On those occasions, the complainant was not asked to recount in minute detail what had happened to her, like she was during her evidence-in-chief.  The fact that she had omitted particular details did not in and of itself render her account inconsistent.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Defence also attacks the internal consistency of the complainant’s evidence on two other grounds.  First, it submits that it is unbelievable that the complainant did not have the strength to physically resist her assailant despite being able to rush to the Toilet whenever she had the urge to vomit.  On this point, I accept the evidence of Dr Zheng that the complainant’s ability to do the latter but not the former can be explained by the fact that the biological urge to vomit was familiar to her and so she was able to maintain control over that urge and react by vomiting only in a socially appropriate place as she was accustomed to doing.  On the other hand, the experience of sexual assault would have been foreign to the complainant.  The incoordination in motor responses and sensory perceptions from which the complainant suffered as a result of her alcohol consumption the night before might have affected her ability to respond to the sexual assault and call for help.

</div>  That would explain why the complainant had not been able to physically resist her assailant and shout for help as the stimuli arising from her being sexually assaulted was foreign to her and so she had not been able to respond in time and call for help.  On the other hand, the complainant was able to respond more quickly to her biological urge to vomit because that was a sensation that was familiar to her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Second, the Defence argues that the complainant’s account is unbelievable because there is no way in which the accused could have sexually assaulted the complainant in the Flat without drawing the attention of its other occupants.  I do not see how this renders the complainant’s account inconsistent.  It is not the complainant’s evidence that she had screamed or shouted out loud for help at any point in time, and as such, the fact that none of the other occupants in the Flat were alerted to the assault does not render her account unbelievable.  Also, the Defence’s submission on this point is essentially premised on the fact that the complainant had failed to react in a particular way which it says she ought to have, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, screaming and shouting for help and thus alerting the other occupants in the Flat, and as such, the Defence submits that her testimony is not believable.  As a matter of principle, this cannot be correct.  There is no basis for any submission that is premised on the complainant of a sexual offence being expected to behave in any particular way.  This is because it cannot be supposed that victims of sexual offences will act in a stereotypical way (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr </span>[2019] 3 SLR 749 at [30]-[34]).

</div>  Whether the complainant’s testimony is unusually convincing and is to be believed depends on the sufficiency of that testimony alone and the other evidence before the court.  The fact that the complainant had failed to behave in a particular way in which one may ordinarily expect does not undermine her account.  Thus, I find that, the fact that the complainant never shouted for help does not render her account unbelievable.  More importantly, there is a good explanation for why she never did so - the complainant’s alcohol intoxication meant that her ability to respond to unfamiliar stimuli like a sexual assault was impaired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, I also find that the complainant’s testimony is externally consistent in various ways.  First, the account which the complainant provided as to how she came to be assaulted is consistent with the bruises that were later found on her left and right knees and her forehead, which had been noted by Dr Koh when she examined the complainant at 12.04am on 28 December 2016.

</div>  Put simply, I do not think that there is enough evidence for the Defence to postulate that the complainant had sustained her bruises while she was moving from the Toilet to Julniee’s bedroom with Julniee, and so I reject the Defence’s alternative explanation about the bruises that were found on the complainant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Second, that the complainant had been assaulted in the way she says she was, is also corroborated by the way she acted after she woke up in Julniee’s bedroom slightly before 8.00am (which was when she called [D] (see [19] above)), a few hours after the incident involving the accused.  In the aftermath, she had contacted her friends, and expressed her feelings of distress and anxiety as to what had happened.  She was also emotional and panicky.  [E], [D] and [F] gave evidence as to the complainant’s conduct and what she said.  As I have considered earlier, their evidence was consistent with the complainant’s (see also [81]-[82] above).  In my view, this adds credibility to the complainant’s evidence that she had been assaulted.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Third, and most critically, the forensic evidence showed that the accused’s semen was found on the exterior back portion of the T-shirt that the complainant had been wearing at the time of the assaults. This corroborates her testimony that she had been sexually penetrated in the anus by the accused with his penis.  This DNA evidence emerged well after the complainant made the police report and gave her investigation statement, and there is thus no danger of the complainant having made tailored her accusations of sexual assault to match the forensic evidence. The Defence submits that there are other explanations for why the accused’s semen came to be found on the exterior back of the T-shirt (see [55] above).  This is a point which I will return to later in this judgment (see [180]–[183] below).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The complainant’s demeanour</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I also accept the Prosecution’s submission that the complainant’s evidence was textured, precise and clear.  She described carefully and with details how she was brought out of the Toilet on two occasions, how she made her way back to the Toilet twice, and how she was then sexually penetrated in the anus while in the Toilet.  This sequence of events carried with it a ring of truth, in that it is difficult to conceive why such details would be provided if the complainant simply wanted to fabricate allegations against the accused.  In short, I find her evidence to be rather compelling. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I also find that the complainant was candid and forthcoming, and she did not take the opportunity to embellish her evidence at times when she could have easily done so.  In particular, she admitted that she did not have a clear look at the face of her assailant, and thus could not visually identify him.  She testified that her eyes were shut when she was kissed on the lips, and later when she was digitally penetrated in her vagina, and hence did not see the face of her assailant clearly.  She only said that, when she briefly opened her eyes after the digital penetration, she saw the same dark blue-coloured shirt.  These were all instances where the complainant could have easily said that she saw that it was the accused who was assaulting her (see also [78] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I find that the complainant is an honest witness who was prepared to admit to details that she could not remember, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, how she got dressed again after she had been sexually penetrated in her anus while in the Toilet.

</div>  She was also able to give a proper explanation as to why she did not physically resist her assailant during the assaults, and why she did not cry out for help.  She felt too weak and sleepy from all the drinking and vomiting to be able to push the accused away or call for help.  She was also able to explain how, when she felt the urge to vomit, she managed to summon the strength to get up and make her way back to the Toilet.  I accept her evidence as being credible and believable.  In short, I find that she has given unusually convincing testimony about the sexual assaults by the accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of Julniee’s evidence      </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The contrast between Julniee’s WhatsApp messages that she exchanged with the complainant on 26 and 27 December 2016, and her investigation statements (the 28 Dec Statement and the 28 Apr Statement), on the one hand, and her oral evidence in court on the other, could not be more stark.

While there is no audio, this video shows the physical interaction between the complainant and Julniee, which is consistent with my view that they were close friends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I turn now to the WhatsApp messages that were sent after the complainant left the Flat at about 8.00am to 9.00am on the morning of 26 December 2016.  This was several hours after the alleged sexual assaults on the complainant, and not long after Julniee was told by [D] that the complainant had been sexually assaulted.  It is clear from the messages sent by Julniee that she was upset by what she heard had happened to the complainant.  Julniee told the complainant that she would find out who was responsible and sort things out.

From the perspective of the complainant, she did not want to make an outright accusation that Julniee’s brother was the assailant, and perhaps she was hoping against hope that he might not be the person who was actually responsible.  She did not want her friendship with Julniee to be destroyed.  From the perspective of Julniee, she was quite distressed by what had happened to her close friend, and the fact that the person responsible might be her own brother.  She wanted to do what was right by getting at the truth, but she was also afraid as to what the complainant would do and the consequences for her brother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 At around 10.00am, Julniee sent the complainant WhatsApp messages to the effect that she had tried speaking to the accused, Ruben and Alex, and that all of them did not say anything.

</div>  Julniee repeatedly told the complainant that she would help find out who the assailant was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I find that, by this stage, Julniee already<span class="font-italic"> </span>knew that her brother was responsible for the sexual assaults which the complainant complained of, though the messages exchanged between Julniee and the complainant up until that point and which I have referred to earlier may suggest otherwise.  In my judgment, it would have been clear in Julniee’s mind that the only person who could have been responsible for the assaults on the complainant must be the accused.  On Julniee’s own account, during the time in which she had left the complainant alone in the Toilet after changing her into the T-shirt and shorts, she <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that her parents were already asleep in their room, Ruben was speaking to her, and Alex was asleep in the accused’s room.  It would have been obvious to her that the accused was the only male person in the Flat who could have been responsible for the assaults on the complainant.  Indeed, the fact that Julniee knew that the accused was the complainant’s assailant must have been the reason she wanted to know whether the complainant was going to make a police report and why she tried to dissuade the complainant from going to the police.  I should add that, as Julniee continued to press the complainant not to make a police report because they were “good friend[s]”, at one point, the complainant responded to Julniee in a message at 5.25pm that if Julniee could get the assailant to admit to his responsibility, apologise and to explain his actions, she would “let it go”.

</div>
</div>  As I mentioned earlier, at the time when Julniee began to ask if the complainant was going to make a police report and when she tried to dissuade the complainant from making a police report, she already knew that the accused was the complainant’s assailant (see [110] above).  As such, by promising the complainant to find “that person”, Julniee intended to tell the complainant that she would try to get the accused to admit to what he had done, in the hope that this would help mollify the complainant and she would then not make a police report, or perhaps lead to some resolution of the matters between the accused and the complainant.  Put another way, Julniee was trying to do what she could in the hope of averting an outcome where the complainant made a police report.  I find that Julniee was desperately hoping to avoid such an eventuality.  That this had been on Julniee’s mind is especially evident from Julniee’s subsequent message at 5.52pm, in which she tried to find out from the complainant as to what exactly the latter intended to do, namely, whether she only wanted to find out the identity of “that person” or if she still wanted to make a police report.  Julniee was obviously concerned that, if she followed through with her promise to get the accused to admit to what he had done, the complainant would not then go to the police.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 It appears that shortly after, the complainant changed her mind from earlier (see [110] above). She said in a WhatsApp message at 5.53pm to Julniee: “I want to find out and I want to go to the police as well”.

</div>  It thus became apparent from the complainant’s response that she had made up her mind about making a police report.  This alarmed Julniee, who in a message at 5.59pm, told the complainant that she was going over to the complainant’s place immediately.  The complainant told her not to do so because she was going out with her sister and no one would be at home.  Then, between 6.01pm and 6.10pm, the following WhatsApp messages were exchanged between them:

First, it is clear from the exchange that Julniee knew all along that the allegations of sexual assault made by the complainant involved her brother.  That could have been the only reason the complainant would have said “and you didn’t believe me” after Julniee identified the accused as “that person”. Significantly, the complainant’s message was followed shortly after by Julniee’s apology.  Second, it appears from those messages that the accused had made a partial admission to Julniee of the sexual assaults that occurred, a point which I will return to later in this judgment (see [158] below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The WhatsApp messages that follow from the above quoted ones indicate that Julniee’s and the accused’s parents were not home yet, but were on the way back.  Julniee asked the complainant in no less than three different WhatsApp messages whether she was still going to make a police report.

</div>  In my view, it is clear from these messages that Julniee was hoping that, with her identifying the accused as the assailant and her communicating the accused’s offer to “talk things out”, the complainant would be mollified and so would not go ahead with making the police report.  It also shows that, at this time, Julniee still thought that she could dissuade the complainant from going to the police.  Julniee and the complainant then had the following exchange of WhatsApp messages between 6.22pm and 6.59pm, in which Julniee kept up her efforts:

In particular, the Defence urges me to accept her evidence that she did not ask the accused, or his friends, on 26 December 2016 to check on what happened to the complainant, and that on 27 December 2016, the accused never admitted to having “fingered” the complainant, to either her (see [114] above) or her family (see [117] above).  According to Julniee’s testimony, she had made up all these lies in the hope that the complainant would somehow be satisfied knowing that she (Julniee) was trying to find out who the complainant’s assailant was, when she actually was hoping to brush off the complainant’s concerns.  On 27 December 2016, she had also purportedly lied to the complainant about her brother being the assailant, thinking that the complainant would then drop this idea of making a police report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I have quoted <span class="font-italic">in extenso</span> portions of the relevant WhatsApp exchanges between the complainant and Julniee on 26 and 27 December 2016 above, and also set out the context of the discussions between the two of them, to demonstrate how utterly incredible Julniee’s evidence in court is.  It is obvious that Julniee was in a distressed state on 26 and 27 December 2016 because she had learnt about what had happened to the complainant.  She was concerned as a friend, and she wanted to help the complainant (see [107]-[108] above).  Given this, I reject her evidence in court that she did not actually check with the accused and his friends on 26 December 2016 about whether they knew of the assaults alleged by the complainant.  I find it rather unbelievable for Julniee to have lied about wanting to find out who the assailant was, and about whether her brother (the accused) was the person responsible for the assaults.  In my judgment, given the circumstances in which Julniee had been placed, it is implausible that she would have wanted to just brush off the complainant’s concerns.  The complainant and Julniee were very close friends, and the WhatsApp messages shed light on Julniee’s true state of mind at that time.  In any case, I find Julniee’s testimony rather unbelievable because I can see no reason for her to think that her lies could have succeeded in brushing off the complainant’s concerns.  The complainant was obviously very upset about what had happened and it would have been apparent to Julniee that the complainant would not have ceased pursuing the matter simply because someone had been identified as her assailant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I also reject as utterly unbelievable Julniee’s evidence that the accused had not admitted to her and her family on 27 and/or 28 December 2016 that he had “fingered” the complainant (see also [114] and [117] above).  I have tried to set out the context of the discussions between Julniee and the complainant as much as possible so that one can understand that, through the late afternoon of 27 December 2016 until the early evening of that day, Julniee was trying to dissuade the complainant from making a police report, but at the same time struggling with her desire to help her friend confirm the truth as to what happened.  That is clearly apparent from the content and tone of the WhatsApp messages that Julniee sent.  At all times, it appears to me that Julniee was honest in her communications with the complainant, demonstrating concern for the complainant’s well-being, and also hoping that she could dissuade the complainant from going to the police (see also [123] below).  In my view, given the context in which Julniee had exchanged WhatsApp messages with the complainant, the contents of those messages would have been truthful.  Thus, Julniee’s message to the complainant about the accused’s admission (first to Julniee and later to their parents) is evidence that the admission did take place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I find that there is no reason for Julniee to lie in these contemporaneous messages to the complainant about the accused’s admission to “fingering” her.  By the time Julniee communicated the accused’s admission to the complainant (see [113] above), she already knew that the complainant appeared to have made up her mind about making a police report about the assaults, and she was hoping that telling the complainant the truth would persuade her to give them a chance to resolve things without the involvement of the police.  It is also important to note that Julniee only identified<span class="font-italic"> </span>the accused as the assailant <span class="font-italic">after </span>it seemed that the complainant had more or less made up her mind about going to the police (see [113] above).  The severity of the situation would thus have been apparent to Julniee and I find there to be no plausible reason she would lie about the accused’s admission.  By confirming that it was the accused who was responsible, Julniee must have known that there was a high risk that the complainant would identify the accused as the assailant in any police report that she might make.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I also find Julniee’s evidence that she made up a lie about the accused’s admission so that the complainant would <span class="font-italic">not</span> make a police report to be completely implausible.  In the first place, I do not see how the identification of the accused, or indeed anyone, as the assailant would necessarily have stopped the complainant from making a police report.  As the WhatsApp messages show, it was clear that the complainant had settled on the decision to make a police report whether Julniee came back with confirmation of the accused’s involvement or not.  It was likely that Julniee proceeded with communicating the accused’s admission, and his offer to talk things out, in a desperate<span class="font-italic"> </span>attempt to dissuade the complainant from going to the police.  In those circumstances, I find it all the more likely that Julniee would have been truthful in her messages to the complainant as she still believed that she was in a position to dissuade the complainant from going to the police.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Also, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that, if it were true that Julniee was simply making something up about the accused being the assailant, then she would have told the complainant the truth in her WhatsApp messages <span class="font-italic">after</span> it became clear to her that the latter was going to the police and identify the accused as her assailant.

</div>
</div>  At the very latest, after the accused was taken away by the police in the early hours of 28 December 2016, Julniee would have sent a message to the complainant to tell her the “truth”.  Instead, up to about 5.18am that morning, she appeared to be keeping up with the “lies” that the accused was responsible for the assault (see [118] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Defence could offer no reason for Julniee wanting to frame her brother as the assailant, other that the fact that she is a “habitual liar”, and that Julniee wanted to stick to her lie after she made up a story to the complainant that the accused had admitted to having “fingered” her.  I find it quite inconceivable that Julniee would have lied for this reason, especially about something as serious as an offence of sexual assault.  I also noted that there is no evidence before me that Julniee has a habit of lying to her friends and family.  In fact, the only evidence of alleged lying on the part of Julniee that the Defence can point to are these very WhatsApp exchanges with the complainant that incriminate the accused.  The Defence points to Julniee’s admission during cross-examination by the Defence that she had an occasional habit of lying, and that it was this habit which had resulted in serious allegations of sexual assault being made against the accused.

</div>  However, it is quite evident from the foregoing that large parts of Julniee’s oral testimony are blatant untruths directed at the sole purpose of assisting the accused’s defence.  In my view, Julniee’s answer about her being a “liar” does not assist the Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Also, the Defence could not give any sensible reason for Julniee wishing to make false accusations against her brother.  There is no evidence that she and the accused had a strained or difficult relationship.  Quite the contrary, the accused testified that the two of them had a loving relationship, and he was protective of his sister.  While the accused did say that Julniee was “mischievous”, and that he would be controlling her over her consumption of alcohol and the hours that she stayed out at night, he stopped short of saying that Julniee had made false accusations against him because of such reasons.

</div> In my judgment, this punctures the entirety of the Defence’s submission that Julniee lied that the accused had admitted, at least partly, to the sexual assaults against the complainant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Defence also submits that Julniee lied to the complainant because she had been driven out of desperation to do so.  They argue that the only options which the complainant presented Julniee with was for Julniee to identify the assailant and get him to apologise (and she would thereafter let the matter rest) or else she would make a police report.  It was therefore out of desperation that Julniee lied about the accused having admitted to “fingering” the complainant.

</div>
</div>
</div>  I reject this submission entirely.  As the above quoted WhatsApp messages exchanged between Julniee and the complainant show, the complainant never issued any such ultimatum to Julniee.  The complainant was obviously distressed at what had happened to her, and did want Julniee to help her confirm who had been her assailant, but at no time did she present Julniee with an ultimatum to identify her assailant or else she would make a police report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Instead, it had been Julniee who was concerned about the well-being of her friend.  The idea that the complainant would possibly agree to let things go if “that person” admitted to the sexual assaults only surfaced <span class="font-italic">after </span>Julniee began asking the complainant if she was going to make a police report (see [112] above).  As I have explained earlier, the fact that Julniee was trying to dissuade the complainant from making a police report can only be explained by the fact that she knew that it was her brother who had been responsible for sexually assaulting the complainant (see [110] above).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Julniee’s investigation statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I now come to Julniee’s two investigation statements, the 28 Dec Statement and the 28 Apr Statement (see [30] and [33] above).  The 28 Dec Statement was recorded less than two days after the events of 26 and 27 December 2016.  What Julniee said in that first statement was largely consistent with the contents of her WhatsApp messages to the complainant.  She told ASP Tai that [D] had told her (through the complainant’s phone) about the sexual assault on the complainant.  Consistent with the complainant’s evidence about her reluctance to tell Julniee about what had happened to her (see [14] above), the 28 Dec Statement also records Julniee informing ASP Tai that [D] had informed her (Julniee) that the complainant did not know how to tell her what had happened and that was why it had been [D] (instead of the complainant) who recounted to her what had happened.  Julniee also said that she had checked with Ruben and the accused in the evening of 26 December 2016 to find out what had happened to the complainant.  Significantly, she told ASP Tai that, on 27 December 2016, she had questioned the accused again, and this is what the accused told her: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… He told me that he could recall some parts of it and he claimed that while he was smoking in the kitchen, he heard [V] fell [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] so he went in to help her up.  He told me that [V] threw himself on him and they make out.  He mentioned that they were kissing but could not remember what happened after that.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the evening, I sent a message to [V] and informed her that my brother is responsible for what had happened and persuaded her not to lodge a police report.  In my opinion, Alex and Ruben are not involved as Alex was in the room all the time and Ruben was with me when I left [V] alone in the toilet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In my view, there was absolutely no reason for Julniee to have lied to ASP Tai in the account that she gave above.  The Defence argues that Julniee had lied in her WhatsApp messages to the complainant the day before about the accused having admitted to be responsible for the assault, and so she continued to keep up with her lies in the 28 Dec Statement because she did not want to be seen as a liar.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I do not accept the evidence of Julniee that she had lied in the 28 Dec Statement about the accused’s partial admission.  It was clear to me, from the way she gave her testimony in court, that she was a very reluctant witness for the Prosecution.  She was being called to give evidence about her WhatsApp messages and statements which, at least partially, incriminated her brother in respect of the charges.  It was obvious that she wanted to help her brother’s case, and to do that, she had to recant what she said in her investigation statements.  Her discomfort when confronted with those incriminating portions of her statements was patently clear to me.  While she did say that she lied in her statements to ASP Tai, she could give no credible reason for doing so.  I rejected the Defence’s submission that she wanted to keep up with the lies in her WhatsApp messages from the past two days before the 28 Dec Statement because she did not want to be exposed as a liar.  I have already found that Julniee did not lie in her WhatsApp messages to the complainant on 26 and 27 December 2016 (see [122] above), and as such, this submission by the Defence has no basis and must be rejected.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The same analysis applies to the 28 Apr Statement that Julniee gave to ASP Tai on 28 April 2017.  For the recording of that statement, she was shown the specific WhatsApp messages she had sent to the complainant and asked to explain them.  She confirmed that the accused had admitted to her on 27 December 2016 that he had “fingered” the complainant.  She also confirmed, as per the WhatsApp messages sent to the complainant in the early hours of 28 December 2016 (see [117] above), that the accused had admitted to their parents after they returned home that he had “fingered” the complainant although the accused maintained that he did not penetrate the complainant.  I find the contents of the 28 Apr Statement to be consistent with Julniee’s WhatsApp messages to the complainant.  I do not accept Julniee’s oral testimony that she had lied to ASP Tai.  As already explained, she could give no reason for lying to ASP Tai, save that she wanted to cover up her earlier lie to the complainant in the WhatsApp messages, which is an explanation which I have already rejected (see [131] above).  I find that she had given such untruthful oral testimony in a barefaced attempt to assist her brother in this criminal trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In sum, I find that Julniee’s credit as a witness has been impeached.  She came to court with a clear intent to give false testimony in order to help the accused.  While she was giving her evidence, she was warned more than once that, if she admitted to lying in her investigation statements, and it was found by the court that she indeed had lied in those statements, she might well find herself the subject of criminal charges for lying in those statements.

</div>
</div>  Julniee’s discomfort upon being warned was patently clear to anyone who was present in the courtroom to see.  Nonetheless, she persisted in her testimony that she had lied to ASP Tai when her investigation statements were being recorded.  Perhaps, in her mind, she had a misguided belief that she could sacrifice herself in order to save her brother.  As it turns out, I find that Julniee was being truthful in her investigation statements, and it was in her oral testimony that she had decided to be less than forthright, which is to put things mildly.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of the accused’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As I have already related earlier, the accused gave an account of what he did in the kitchen and service balcony area of the Flat in the early morning of 26 December 2016 that was at odds with the complainant’s version of events (see [42]-[48] above).  As I explain below, I find several difficulties with the accused’s evidence which renders his account rather unbelievable and, more significantly, lacking in credibility.  In my judgment, his oral evidence is an afterthought concocted as a defence to the charges.  I also find that the other evidence, in particular the WhatsApp messages the accused exchanged with Pang and Alson, and the presence of the accused’s semen on the exterior back of the T-shirt, are consistent with the fact that he had, in the early hours of 26 December 2016, sexually assaulted the complainant in the manner which she has alleged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Difficulties with the accused’s evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The accused’s evidence is that, after he was asked by Julniee for some privacy so she could speak with Ruben, he made his way to the kitchen.  According to him, the Flat was in darkness and the kitchen lights were off.  He testified that, as he entered the kitchen, he did not notice whether the lights at the service balcony area, which is at the other end of the kitchen, were on.

</div>
</div>  He then sat on a chair in the kitchen and started smoking before he heard a “thud” from the service balcony area.  He then went to check and found the complainant vomiting the toilet.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I find the accused’s explanation of how he discovered the complainant rather odd.  It appears to me quite unlikely that, if all the lights, including those of the kitchen, were off, the accused would not have immediately noticed that the lights in the service balcony area were on.  Also, given that the complainant was vomiting, the accused would surely have heard some noise coming from the service balcony area. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Be that as it may, the accused’s evidence is that he tried to help the complainant from the floor of the Toilet and, as he was lifting her up, her head and body turned such that she was facing him, and their faces almost came into contact.  He then placed her on the floor of the Toilet in a comfortable position, with her back leaning against the wall.  He then went back to the kitchen, sat on the chair there just a few metres away from the Toilet, and resumed smoking.  Again, I find this account rather puzzling.  According to the accused, he was concerned to see if the complainant was alright.  The accused’s evidence is that the complainant had not been able to respond to him when he asked if she was okay.  Yet, after he placed her in a sitting position in the Toilet, he simply ignored her and went back to smoking, while sitting just a few metres away.  He did not go back to his room and inform Julniee that her friend was in such a state.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Again, leaving this aside, the next part of the accused’s evidence suffers from some serious difficulties.  In his evidence-in-chief, the accused testified that, when he saw Julniee entering the kitchen, he said to her words to the effect that her friend was “damn drunk” (see [48] above).  He also claimed that Ruben had come into the kitchen with Julniee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 However, this was not the accused’s position during the Prosecution’s case.  When Julniee was cross-examined as a witness for the Prosecution, the Defence put the following case to her <span class="font-italic">about what the accused had told her </span><span class="font-italic">after she entered the kitchen following her private conversation with Ruben in the accused’s room</span>.  That was: (a) the complainant had fallen in the toilet, and the accused had gone into the Toilet to take a look at her;  (b) the accused then tapped the complainant on the shoulder to see if she was okay;  (c) the accused then lifted her up from the back and in the process of doing so, the complainant had turned around and hugged him;  (d) their faces were so close, that their lips might have touched;  (e) he then placed the complainant in a sitting position, with her head and back resting against the wall;  (f) he then tapped her on the shoulder again, and asked if she was okay;  (g) he then left her there in this comfortable position, with her arms wrapped around her own body.

</div>  In other words, the accused allegedly described to Julniee the precise details of his encounter with the complainant in the Toilet, upon Julniee entering the kitchen with Ruben.  When all this was put to her, Julniee’s response was that she did not recall the accused having said any of these things to her.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I make two observations here.  First, the Defence’s case that was put to Julniee appears rather implausible.  To put things bluntly, it appears rather inconceivable that the accused would suddenly tell Julniee all these details about his encounter with the complainant in the Toilet, in particular, about the complainant hugging him and how their (the complainant’s and the accused’s) lips might have touched, in a completely unprompted manner.  Further, if he did in fact blurt out all these details to Julniee, I find it quite impossible to believe that Julniee would not have remembered at least part of what the accused had said.  It would have been so out of the ordinary that it surely would have left an impression on her mind.  She would have then told the complainant of this later, since that would help provide some explanation for why the complainant might have thought she had been sexually assaulted in the toilet.  Also, what the accused supposedly informed Julniee at the time when she came into the kitchen essentially provided an account for what might have happened during the period of time when the complainant was left alone in the Toilet, which is also when the alleged sexual assault had taken place.  If the accused indeed informed Julniee about all these details of his encounter with the complainant, I find that Julniee would have told ASP Tai about them in the 28 Dec Statement because it would help explain any accusation of sexual assault made by the complainant.  Yet, Julniee’s 28 Dec Statement (as well as the 28 Apr Statement) made no mention of this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Second, it seems to me that the accused had changed his case between the time of Julniee’s cross-examination, and his own evidence-in-chief.  After Julniee gave evidence that she did not remember the accused telling all these details about his helping the complainant in the Toilet and what transpired in the process, I find that he tailored his evidence to simply echo what Julniee said – that he told Julniee that her friend was “damn drunk” and that was all.

In his answer as recorded in the Second Statement, the accused did not provide any clarification like that which he gave in his oral testimony.

Quite clearly, the import of this part of the accused’s testimony is that he was absolutely sure that the two of them never kissed.

I am not quite persuaded by that explanation because, if the accused’s and the complainant’s faces never came into actual contact, it would seem to follow that their lips would also not have come into contact.  I also find it rather odd that the accused is unable to recall whether his and the complainant’s lips came into actual contact, despite him being so certain that their faces never came into actual contact, and especially given his own evidence that it would have been “absolutely disgusting” to kiss someone who was vomiting, like the complainant was.

</div>  I find that these slightly varying accounts over time cast some doubt on the credibility of the accused.  In my view, the accused was clearly trying to avoid giving testimony that had any chance of implicating him (given the subject matter of the fourth charge) even if that meant saying something untrue.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 What I find of more significance, though, is the complete absence in the First Statement and the Second Statement of the details of his encounter with the complainant in the Toilet.  In his oral testimony, the accused gave a detailed description about how he had lifted the complainant up from behind, how she swung around, how her right arm was holding on to his left shoulder for support, how their bodies were in close contact, how their faces came very close to each other, and how he later placed her on the floor with her back against the wall in a comfortable position.  However, he failed to give any of these details in his two investigation statements.  Instead, his description in those statements was limited to saying that they had hugged in the Toilet and, leaving aside the issue of whether they kissed, that he could not remember anything else.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In my judgment, the accused’s failure to describe exactly what happened in the Toilet with the complainant in the First Statement and the Second Statement, as compared to his detailed description in his oral evidence in court, suggests that the accused’s oral evidence is not true.  Although an accused person is allowed by s 22(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) to withhold mentioning any incriminatory fact, if the fact that is withheld will exculpate him from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for his omission to mention it earlier (see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 67 at [152]).  An exculpatory fact or circumstance also has more credibility if it was disclosed to an investigating officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest (see <span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 157 at [19]).  The details that the accused has provided in his oral evidence are exculpatory facts which provided an explanation of what exactly happened during his encounter with the complainant in the Toilet.  When the First Statement and the Second Statement were recorded, the accused was also trying to explain to ASP Tai that no sexual assault had taken place.  That being the case, I would expect the accused to have explained exactly how he came into physical contact with the complainant, at the latest, in the Second Statement after he had done “some reflection” and “tried to analyse the scene” where the alleged sexual assault had taken place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The accused provided some explanation for why he had left out those details in his investigation statements.  In respect of the First Statement, he says that he was not in a composed state and did not have enough rest when the statement came to be recorded, and also that, when he gave the statement, all that came to his mind was to explain the sexual assault allegations made against him and “nothing more about anything else”.

</div>  In respect of the Second Statement, the accused’s explanation was very much the same, namely, that he did not think of providing more details because all he thought he had to do was to “explain myself” on a sexual assault allegation made against him.

</div>  In substance, he claims that all he thought he had to do was to put forth an account that was contrary to that put forth by the complainant, which he thought he already did by stating in his investigation statements that he had not intentionally hugged the complainant and that he could not remember whether he had kissed the complainant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I do not find these explanations convincing.  In my view, given the accused’s evidence that he knew he had to “explain” himself for the sexual assault allegations made against him during the statement recording process, he must have known that it did not suffice for him to simply deny those allegations, and that he had to provide details of how the allegations made against him were untrue.  It is thus inexplicable why the accused would have left out in his investigation statements the exculpatory details that he provided in his oral testimony. More importantly, the accused did not merely omit<span class="font-italic"> </span>to provide those details to ASP Tai when his investigation statements were recorded.  Instead, his position in those statements had been that he <span class="font-italic">could not remember </span>anything else about his interactions with the complainant that early morning other than what he had already told ASP Tai.  The accused explained during cross-examination that what he meant by this was that nothing else had happened between him and the complainant other than whatever he had already told ASP Tai, and he did not mean to say that he could not remember if anything else might have happened between him and the complainant.

</div>
</div>  I reject this explanation.  It is clear from the accused’s use of “I cannot remember what happened after that” in the First Statement that he meant to inform ASP Tai that he could not remember if anything else <span class="font-italic">might have happened</span>, especially since he also told ASP Tai that he “only remembered” that he had tapped the complainant’s shoulder and at one point she had hugged him.  The same may also be said of the accused’s use of “I can’t remember” in the Second Statement when he was asked if he could now recall what had happened during his encounter with the complainant in the Toilet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In any event, the accused’s explanation still does not provide a proper justification for why he would have failed to mention in his investigation statements those details which he now relies on in his oral evidence.  If the accused had been innocent, then when faced with such serious allegations against him, he would have provided all the details which he could remember rather than simply maintaining his inability to recall anything that might have happened, a position that obviously leaves room for speculation.  In my judgment, the version of events provided by the accused in his oral evidence is an afterthought concocted by him for his defence to the charges.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I come now to the accused’s evidence on how he reacted when Julniee attempted to speak to him on 27 December 2016 as to what had happened between him and the complainant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The accused’s evidence is that he was having an argument with Pang in his room in the late afternoon of 27 December 2016 when Julniee wanted to speak to him.  Julniee told him that the complainant had claimed that “someone” had sexually assaulted her, and then Julniee showed him a message from the complainant that read: “Because you want [to protect] your brother if it was him that did it?” (see [49] above).  The accused testified that he understood from what Julniee was telling him, and from the message shown to him, that the complainant was accusing him of sexual assault.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The accused testified that he was not really concerned or bothered about this allegation.  His evidence is that he told Julniee that this had nothing to do with him, and told her to “settle” with her friend.  He then went back into his room to talk with Pang (see [49] above). Not long after, the accused left the room and went to the kitchen.  Julniee then told him that she had told the complainant that he was responsible for the sexual assault.  The accused felt “lost” when he heard this, and then shouted at Julniee with words to the effect that she was “crazy”, and asked her whether she knew what she was even doing.  He also told Julniee that she was ruining his future.  He then returned to the room to calm down (see [50] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I find the accused’s account of this episode with Julniee on 27 December 2016 rather incredible.  He was being told by his sister about a serious allegation of sexual assault, and that the victim was accusing him of being the perpetrator.  Yet, his evidence was to the effect that he was rather unfazed by the accusation.  I say this because, under cross-examination, the accused testified that he did not feel shocked by the complainant’s accusation, even though he was hearing it for the first time.

</div>
</div>  In my view, the accused’s evidence defies belief and I reject it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Julniee’s account of this episode in court was consistent with that of the accused’s.  As I already found, Julniee was not telling the truth in so far as she testified that the accused did not admit to “fingering” the complainant.  Her contemporaneous WhatsApp messages to the complainant, and the 28 Apr Statement (which explains those messages), detail what had actually happened.  As mentioned earlier, Julniee asked the complainant for the first time, at 5.15pm, if she intended to make a police report (see [109] above).  In the very next message sent by the complainant, she asked Julniee “Because you want [to protect] your brother if it was him that did it?” (see [16] above).  From that time onwards, it became apparent that the complainant was intending to make a police report about the sexual assaults, where the accused would be named as her assailant.  As I also mentioned earlier, after repeated requests by Julniee for the complainant to not make a police report on account of their friendship, the complainant said in a message sent at 5.25pm that she will “let it go” if Julniee could get “him” (which Julniee knew referred to the accused) to admit to his responsibility, apologise and explain his actions (see [110] above).  I find that Julniee would have then informed the accused that the complainant was threatening to go to the police, and that the only way to possibly prevent this was for the accused to come clean about what had happened.  It was in that context that the accused eventually admitted that he “fingered” the complainant while in a drunken state.  I therefore find that the accused did in fact admit to Julniee that he had “fingered” the complainant, but tried to explain that they were both drunk.  He also told Julniee that he wanted to talk things through with the complainant, which Julniee later conveyed to the complainant in a WhatsApp message saying, “my brother was hoping you’d talk things out” (see [113] above).  When Julniee was asked to explain that message during the recording of the 28 Apr Statement, she also told ASP Tai that the accused was hoping to “settle the matter privately” with the complainant (see [33] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 As I have found earlier, at the material time, Julniee was trying to dissuade the complainant from making a police report, and Julniee still believed that she could stop the complainant from doing so if she could get the accused to admit and apologise to the complainant (see [115] above).  That was why, shortly after it became clear to Julniee that the complainant had made up her mind about going to the police, Julniee told the complainant about the accused’s admission (see [113] above).  Julniee would then have told the accused about what she did, and told him that the only way they could possibly avoid the complainant making a police report was for the accused to admit to what he had done and apologise to the complainant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The accused’s evidence was that he was “lost” and then angry when he found out that Julniee had told the complainant about his admission.  He was probably processing in his mind all the consequences that would follow if the complainant still went ahead to make a police report.  That could explain why the accused felt “lost” initially.  I accept that, at some point, the accused probably did get angry with Julniee, and also told her that she had ruined his future.  Perhaps he did not actually expect Julniee to put it in writing, in the form of a WhatsApp message to the complainant, what he had admitted to.  Unlike Julniee, who genuinely believed (in large part on account of her friendship with the complainant) that communicating the accused’s admission and getting him to apologise was the only way to possibly persuade the complainant not to make a police report, the accused was probably more sceptical about what the complainant would do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 There is one other aspect of the accused’s evidence on his reaction to Julniee’s revelation that she had communicated his admission to the complainant that I do not accept.  According to the accused, after he shouted at Julniee, he simply went back to his room to speak to Pang.

</div>  In my view, if the accused was innocent of any sexual assault as he claims, it beggars belief that he would not have immediately asked Julniee to tell the complainant that he was <span class="font-italic">not</span> actually responsible, and told Julniee that she should own up to the complainant about her lies about him <span class="font-italic">at once</span>.  But, quite incredibly, the accused did no such thing.  This is despite the accused agreeing in his oral evidence that it would have been important for him to immediately tell Julniee to clear his name if Julniee had indeed made a false allegation against him.

</div>  According to the accused, he did not even ask Julniee why she had made up this accusation against him.

His evidence is that he told Pang about the accusation of sexual assault, and she exploded in anger (see [50] above).  He then decided to leave the Flat, and he then drove around aimlessly for some time (see [51] above).  As I described earlier, during this period of time, which lasted from around 8.00pm until past midnight on 28 December 2016, the accused received from, and sent a number of WhatsApp messages to, Pang and his father (see [52] above).  The accused spent a fair bit of time in his evidence-in-chief explaining away the contents of these messages.  Let me highlight the key portions of these WhatsApp exchanges which would show why the accused felt the need to explain what he <span class="font-italic">actually</span> meant by them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I start with his WhatsApp messages exchanged with Pang.

</div>  That was his only explanation.  I completely reject this as I am unable to understand how his state of mind could possibly explain the contents of these messages which suggests that he recognised that he had been responsible for sexually assaulting the complainant.  If the accused had not assaulted the complainant, he would have simply denied the accusation and communicated that to Pang.  Instead, these messages to Pang that I have referred to are consistent with an acceptance by the accused that he had assaulted the complainant, but that he could not accept the consequences of what he had done.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The accused’s WhatsApp exchanges with his father were also in the same vein.  From around 9.00pm on 27 December 2016, the accused’s father, Alson, sent repeated WhatsApp messages to the accused asking him to come back so that they could talk things over.  Alson gave evidence that he was worried about the accused, and that accused’s mother was on the verge of breaking down.

</div>  In my view, the accused’s exchange with his father is consistent with his acceptance that he had sexually assaulted the complainant, and was now worried that she would make a police report.  I find that he could not bring himself to admit to his father that he had penetrated the complainant with his penis, but he was very concerned that the police would not believe him even if he denied such an accusation.  That is why the accused asked rhetorically in more than one of his messages to his father “what if” the “rape” accusation was true.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The accused also sent a series of WhatsApp messages to his mother at around 11.04pm which read: “Im sorry mama” and  “Its was all an accident, but now that situation has came until so serious, I really cannot accept the truth”.

</div>  As with his other messages to his father and Pang, this message to his mother is consistent with an acknowledgement that he was responsible for the assault on the complainant, although he did claim that it was an “accident”.  When pressed in cross-examination by the Prosecution as to what he meant by an “accident”, the accused could not provide any credible explanation of what he meant.

I find that the accused’s WhatsApp messages exchanged with Pang and his parents after he had left the Flat in the evening of 27 December 2016 support the Prosecution’s case that he had admitted to Julniee about “fingering” the complainant (see [114] and [158] above), and when he learnt that the complainant was going to make a police report, he realised the serious consequences of his actions.  He could not face up to what he had done, and he decided to leave the Flat to get away from the situation and think things through.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I should also add that the accused’s WhatsApp messages exchanged with Alson also show that he was unhappy about Julniee having communicated his admission to the complainant, as I have mentioned earlier (see [160] above).

These messages exchanged with Alson are consistent with my earlier finding that the accused had been unable to bring himself to admit to his father that he had penetrated the complainant with his penis or had been responsible for any sexual assault perpetrated on the complainant.  That was why, when pressed by Alson as to what that admission was, the accused did not provide details and simply said that Julniee had “told [the complainant] sorry”.  That is, however, untrue because the accused knew that Julniee had identified him as the assailant and did not merely apologise to the complainant (see [113] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Alson was called as a witness for the Defence.  From his evidence, I could glean that the Defence’s main purpose of calling him as a witness was to debunk the Prosecution’s case that, at some stage during the night of 27 December 2016, or in the early hours of 28 December 2016, the accused admitted to his parents that he had “fingered” the complainant.  This part of the Prosecution’s case was based on the WhatsApp messages sent by Julniee to the complainant shortly after midnight on 28 December 2016 (see [117] above), and the 28 Apr Statement in which Julniee confirmed that the accused had made this admission to his parents (see [132] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I have reviewed Alson’s evidence.  He is clearly an interested witness, given that his son is facing these serious charges.  But quite apart from that, there are aspects of his evidence which I do not find credible.  He claims that he heard about the sexual assault allegations from Julniee when he got home from work at around 7.00pm on 27 December 2016.

Given the state of anxiety he was in after hearing about the sexual assault allegations when he returned home from work that evening, and also that the accused was not at home at that time, I cannot accept his evidence that he did not remember what Julniee had said about the accused’s response to the accusations of sexual assault.  In fact, the tenor of the WhatsApp messages that he had sent to the accused shows that he knew what the accused’s position in relation to the sexual assault allegations were.  Since the accused had left the Flat by the time Alson returned home, Alson would not have had the opportunity to speak to the accused between that time and until 11.04pm that day, which was when the accused started responding to the WhatsApp messages sent to him.  During this period, the only person from whom Alson could find out about the accused’s position on the sexual assault allegations was Julniee.  I find that Julniee must have told Alson about the accused’s admission to having “fingered” the complainant while he was drunk.  That is why Alson’s first WhatsApp message to the accused on the night of 27 December 2016 was “Norvan, papa is aware about the <span class="font-italic">whole situation</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>  This indicates that Alson must have been told by Julniee about what the accused had admitted to doing while he was drunk.  It then appears that Alson was more concerned with the accusation that the accused had sexually penetrated the complainant with his penis, than the accusation of “fingering”.  Perhaps, in his mind, the allegation of digital penetration was less serious.  Also, by the time Alson returned to the Flat on 27 December 2016, I find that Julniee would have been in a state of panic given the near certainty that the complainant was going to make a police report.  In those circumstances, Julniee would surely have filled Alson in about the situation, and in particular, that the accused had admitted to “fingering” the complainant while drunk.  It is likely, however, that Julniee did not tell Alson that she had communicated the accused’s admission to the complainant, as the WhatsApp messages exchanged between Alson and the accused show that Alson appeared to be unaware, at least initially, that Julniee had told the complainant about the accused’s admission (see [169] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In sum, I find that Alson must have been told by Julniee that the accused had admitted to “fingering” the complainant.  He had not been candid when he gave evidence as to what he knew from Julniee about the accused’s admissions earlier that evening (see [172] above).  I note that, despite maintaining that he absolutely could not remember whether Julniee had told him about what the accused had to say about the sexual assault allegations, Alson was very clear, when he questioned Julniee for more details on those allegations, that there was no mention by Julniee “of what she admitted to who or who admitted to who or who admitted to whoever” and that “[t]here wasn’t any admission … in the whole conversation that I had with her”.

In my judgment, this conversation between the accused and his parents would have taken place over the phone, after the last WhatsApp message Alson sent to the accused at 11.41pm saying “Rememver [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] this – the whole world can turn their back on you but not your family!” and before Alson sent another message at 12.21am, about 40 minutes later, asking the accused to “[c]all [him] urgent”.

In his evidence, while the accused was providing an explanation for the contents of the WhatsApp messages he exchanged with Pang and his father, he testified consistently that he had developed “self-guilt”, started to doubt himself and even began to think that he had been responsible for the sexual assault allegations made against him.

</div>  I mention this to emphasise how incredible the accused’s evidence is.  He testified that, at the time when he left the Flat in the evening of 27 December 2016, he had been very clear about his innocence, which was why he had berated Julniee for having framed him and “ruined” his life, and which was also why he felt especially hurt that Julniee was making such allegations against him.

</div>  Given that, I do not see how the accused could subsequently come to be convinced by those WhatsApp messages from Pang and his father that he was somehow responsible for the sexual assault on the complainant.  Indeed, those messages were more concerned with his well-being rather than with the veracity of the sexual assault allegations <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.  The truth can only be that Pang and his father knew, at the time of sending those messages, of his admission to Julniee about having assaulted the complainant.  That was why the accused, when confronted with those messages, never defended his innocence, save for seeking assurances from Pang and his father, which he needed at a time when he was thinking things through. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The presence of the accused’s semen on the T-shirt worn by the complainant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 I deal now more specifically with the charge of sexual assault by the accused penetrating his penis into the complainant’s anus.  The accused denies this accusation.  As I have already explained earlier, I find the complainant’s evidence in relation to this charge to be clear, consistent and convincing (see [101] above).  In addition, her account is consistent with the evidence of the accused’s semen found on the exterior back of the T-shirt she was wearing (see [98] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The Defence has tried to explain the presence of his semen by arguing that his semen might have been present on the floor or wall of the Toilet, or on the clothes in the laundry basket, and then got transferred onto the T-shirt’s exterior through physical contact.

</div>  Further, to explain why his semen would have been present on the floor or wall of the toilet, the accused explained that he would sometimes have unprotected sexual intercourse with Pang in the Toilet and he would ejaculate on the wall or floor of the toilet (see [55] above).

The complainant was wearing the T-shirt at the time of the sexual assault.  Her evidence is that the shorts she was wearing and her underwear was pulled down by the assailant, who was positioned behind her.  The assailant then thrust his penis into her anus a few times before stopping.  She did not know whether her assailant ejaculated.

</div>  The Prosecution’s case is that the accused must have ejaculated and that is why his semen was found on the exterior back portion of the T-shirt.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In these circumstances, given the state of the evidence, I find that the evidential burden had shifted to the Defence to provide a plausible alternative explanation, backed up by evidence, for the presence of the accused’s semen on the T-shirt.  I find that the Defence has failed to discharge its evidential burden.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The Defence did not call any expert evidence on how long semen could <span class="font-italic">remain in a form</span> that allowed it to be transferred from one surface to another through physical contact.  The evidence of the Prosecution’s forensic expert on DNA, Mr Ping, did not assist the Defence.  He agreed that it was possible for semen stains to be transferred from one piece of clothing to another piece of clothing, or from a physical surface to a piece of clothing.  He also agreed that, if one is to assume that there is semen on the floor or wall of the Toilet, and that if the T-shirt that the complainant was wearing came into contact with that, then the semen might be transferred onto the T-shirt.  These answers are rather uncontroversial and commonsensical.  However, what is critical is that Mr Ping was not asked any questions by the Defence as to how long semen found on such surfaces would remain in a form that could be transferred through physical contact.  It is also unclear to me, even if he were so asked, whether he was suitably qualified to answer such a question as an expert.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Significantly, the accused was also not able to say when was the last time he had sexual intercourse with Pang in the Flat (before Pang flew off for her flight attendant duties on the night of 25 December 2016), or more specifically, whether that had taken place in the Toilet.

</div>  Given this, I am unable to conclude on the evidence before me that the Defence has shown that there was any reasonable likelihood that the accused semen had gotten onto the T-shirt through physical contact with any surface in the Toilet or with another piece of clothing in the laundry basket, which is where the T-shirt had been found and seized by the police.  On this point, I should also add that the accused gave no evidence whatsoever that could explain how his semen might be come to be present on another piece of clothing that was in the laundry basket.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 I also accept the Prosecution’s submission that, for the court to accept this theory of transfer of semen onto the T-shirt through physical contact with a surface which already had the accused’s semen, it would require the court to accept that there was a concatenation of events that all transpired to implicate the accused of this offence.  To explain, it would require the court to accept as a reasonable possibility that the accused had sexual intercourse with Pang somewhere in the Flat, but had failed to completely clean up his semen after he ejaculated on some surface somewhere in the Flat.  Thereafter, in those few hours that she was wearing the T-shirt while in the Flat, the complainant then happened to position her body in such a way that her back came into contact with the exact spot in the Flat where those traces of semen remained, and that the semen was still in a form that could be transferred through physical contact.  Then, a few hours later, the complainant told four of her friends that she had been sexually penetrated in the anus by someone who she thought was the accused.  This accusation was made before she even knew about the presence of the accused’s semen on the exterior back of the T-shirt.  With all due respect to the Defence, I do not agree that the court can reasonably come to such a conclusion to explain how the accused’s semen might have been present on the exterior back portion of the T-shirt worn by the complainant during the assault.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sufficiency of time in which the accused could have sexually assaulted the complainant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 Finally, let me deal with the submission of the Defence that there was not enough time for the accused to have committed separate acts of assault on the complainant in the living room, Julniee’s bedroom, and then in the Toilet.

</div>  This submission is predicated on Julniee’s and Ruben’s oral testimony that they spoke in the accused’s room for five minutes or even less before heading out to the kitchen to smoke (see [22] and [58] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In the case of Julniee, the 28 Dec Statement recorded her as telling ASP Tai that she had spoken with Ruben for eight to ten minutes in the accused’s room (see [30] above).

I do not accept Julniee’s attempt in her oral testimony to now claim that her conversation with Ruben in the accused’s room was only five minutes or less.  I have already expressed my views about Julniee’s credibility as a witness in court.

</div>  Despite his generally poor recollection of that night, Ruben was somehow able to steadfastly insist that he spoke to Julniee for five minutes or less.  In my view, he had come to court to assist in his friend’s defence in court by insisting that he had spoken to Julniee for five minutes or less.  His evidence is not reliable.  Put simply, Ruben was not able to testify on anything except for the duration of his conversation with Julniee, the very fact which the accused relies on in his defence.  His explanation that he remembered the contents of the conversation he had with Julniee because it was “impactful”

</div> was neither here nor there.  It does not follow from this that he would then be able to remember whether they had spoken for five minutes or less, or for longer.  I also note that, when questioned during cross-examination as to what the conversation with Julniee was about and how that could have affected the length of that conversation, Ruben was not able to provide any meaningful answer.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In any event, I find that the question of how long Julniee had been speaking to Ruben, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it was about ten minutes or five minutes, is not ultimately determinative of whether there was sufficient time for the accused to have carried out his assaults.  As the Prosecution pointed out in their closing submissions, the complainant’s description of each of the sexual assaults suggested that each of them was brief.  When she was brought to the living room, and laid on the sofa, she testified that she received a “peck” on the lips before she got up almost immediately to go back to the Toilet to vomit some more.  When she was in Julniee’s room and laid on her bed, her evidence is that she briefly felt a hand at the base of one of her breasts, and “a few seconds” later, fingers being inserted into her vagina.

</div>  In my judgment, the acts of sexual assault described by the complainant could not have taken very long.  Even including the two occasions which the accused had to bring the complainant out of the Toilet into the living room and then to Julinee’s room, I find that a period of five to ten minutes would have been sufficient time for all those acts to have taken place.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion        </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In summary, I accept the complainant’s evidence as being unusually clear and convincing.  On the other hand, I find that the accused has not been a credible witness.  His evidence is riddled with difficulties, and the shifting and inconsistent accounts which he provided about his encounter with the complainant at the material time make it clear that his oral evidence in court is an afterthought concocted as a defence to the charges.  I therefore find that the Prosecution has, on the basis of the complainant’s evidence alone, proven its case on all four charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Further, in so far as the second and fourth charges are concerned, the complainant’s evidence is supported by that of Julniee’s, as found in Julniee’s WhatsApp messages on 27 December 2016 and her two investigation statements (the 28 Dec Statement and the 28 Apr Statement).  Julniee’s credit as a witness has been impeached and substantial portions of her oral evidence, where she attempted to resile from the contents of her WhatsApp messages and her two investigation statements, are rejected.  I also find from the WhatsApp messages which Julniee had sent to the complainant in the late afternoon of 27 December 2016 and her message sent to the complainant at 12.16am on 28 December 2016, as well as Julniee’s two investigation statements, that the accused had admitted, first to Julniee, and later to his parents, that he had kissed and digitally penetrated the complainant.  Further, the accused’s WhatsApp messages to Pang and his parents on the night of 27 December 2016 are consistent with an acceptance that he was responsible for the sexual assaults on the complainant forming the subject matter of the second and fourth charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Finally, in so far as the first charge is concerned, I find that the complainant’s evidence is supported by the forensic evidence that the accused’s semen was present on the exterior back of the T-shirt worn by the complainant at the time of the assaults.  I accept the Prosecution’s case that the only reasonable explanation for how the accused’s semen came to be found on the exterior back of the T-shirt is that he had anally penetrated the complainant and ejaculated. The Defence’s submission about the accused’s semen being transferred onto the T-shirt from some surface in the Flat is entirely speculative and not supported by the evidence before the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In the light of the evidence before the court and my findings, I find that the accused is guilty of all the charges.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 I will deal separately with the question of sentencing.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Yiwen, Sheryl Yeo Su Hui and Niranjan Ranjakunalan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Amarjit Singh s/o Hari Singh (Amarjit Sidhu Law Corporation) for the accused. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
