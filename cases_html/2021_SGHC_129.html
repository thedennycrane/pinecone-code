</div> In this connection, counsel’s oral submissions at the hearing focused on the issue of the bankrupt’s alleged beneficial ownership of a property at Poets Villas: as far as I could glean, the Applicant claimed that her decision not to include the Poets Villas property in the pool of matrimonial assets constituted valuable consideration for the transfer of the bankrupt’s interest in the properties which were eventually included in the consent IJ.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In addition, in his oral submissions at the hearing, the Applicant’s counsel also said that the Applicant wanted to adduce further evidence of her lack of notice of the bankruptcy application. This apparently related to the issue of the service of the bankruptcy application: counsel said the Applicant wanted to show that the bankruptcy application had not been served on her and had instead been served via substituted service on “two other properties”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In respect of these issues, it was not actually the Applicant’s case that new evidence had been produced by the Respondents. Instead, the Applicant’s case was that these issues were material, and that she would be prejudiced if she were not given an opportunity to furnish evidence on them. In response, the Respondents objected to the application on the basis that (a) no new evidence had been adduced in their affidavit, and (b) granting the application would result in a delay which would prejudice the creditors and the bankruptcy estate.

No coherent explanation was provided by the Applicant as to why the further evidence she wanted to adduce could not have been furnished earlier.

</div> I approach the OS, therefore, on the basis that the Applicant is really seeking ratification of the dispositions of the River Valley property (or rather, as will be seen later, the sale proceeds therefrom) and the West Coast property pursuant to the said consent orders. In this connection, it is not disputed that s 77(1) of the BA applies to a disposition of property pursuant to a court order – including a consent order: per the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">Cheo Sharon </span><span class="font-italic">Andriesz v Official Assignee of the estate of Andriesz Paul Matthew, a bankrupt</span> [2013] 2 SLR 297 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharon </span><span class="font-italic">Cheo</span> (CA)”) at [30]. <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span>, for example, was a case where the bankrupt had agreed to transfer his interest in two properties to his wife, the appellant, via an interim consent judgment in divorce proceedings initiated by her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is also not disputed that the onus is on the Applicant to persuade the court that the dispositions of the River Valley property (or sale proceeds) and the West Coast property pursuant to the consent orders should be ratified: see in this respect the High Court’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Cheo Sharon </span><span class="font-italic">Andriesz v Official Assignee of the estate of Andriesz Paul Matthew, a bankrupt</span> [2012] 4 SLR 89 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharon </span><span class="font-italic">Cheo</span> (HC)”) at [19] and [22]. In this connection, it is apt to bear in mind the High Court’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Sharon </span><span class="font-italic">Cheo</span> (HC) (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The spouse and children of a bankrupt are often innocent bystanders who are prejudiced by bankruptcy proceedings against the bankrupt and it is understandable that a bankrupt would want to provide for his or her spouse and their children.

In <span class="font-italic">Denney v John Hudson &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1992] BCLC 901 at 904, Fox LJ explained that <span class="font-italic">in considering whether or not to make a validating order, the court “must always do its best to ensure that the interests of the unsecured creditors will not be prejudiced”</span>.   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Similar observations were made by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span> at [28], where the court in dissecting the test for ratification under s 77 of the BA stated (at [26] to [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What then is the test for ratification of a disposition? The first observation to make is that ratification is only necessary if the disposition does not fall within the exception set out in s 77(3) of the BA (now s 328(3) of the IRDA).

There may be occasions when ratification is appropriate even though the conditions of the exception are not met. <span class="font-italic">Good faith, notice and value will be relevant when considering ratification, but how important or necessary they are will have to be considered as part of the overall exercise of discretion. Considerations of good faith and notice will figure differently.

On the other hand, the absence of good faith would almost certainly rule out a successful application for ratification. The presence of good faith would not in itself be sufficient</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Returning to the test for ratification, the starting point is the objective of s 77 of the BA. It is to preserve the bankrupt’s assets for orderly and rateable distribution to the general body of creditors. For this reason, the first consideration must be whether ratification promotes this objective or undermines it. A disposition that was, at the time it was made, in the interests of the general pool of creditors fits with the objective of the provision. Such a disposition may be ratified, if it is otherwise fair and just to do so.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>In determining what was in the interests of the general pool of creditors, the court should ask whether at the time of the disposition it was likely to benefit the general pool of creditors.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Ratification of the disposition of the River Valley property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Dealing first with the River Valley property, the sale of the said property was completed on 14 October 2019.

However, this issue was not explicitly canvassed before me. Moreover, the purchasers were not represented at these proceedings, which meant that I did not have any of the information necessary to determine issues such as whether the purchasers were <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchasers for value without notice: for instance, no information was available on why the sale was completed apparently without the requisite checks being done by the purchasers’ solicitors on the bankruptcy status of the sellers prior to completion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In the circumstances, I make no finding as to whether the disposition by the bankrupt to the purchasers should be ratified.

</div> Rather, it appears from the submissions before me that the Applicant is proceeding on the basis that the River Valley property was no longer owned by the Applicant and the bankrupt at the time of the IJ on 7 November 2019. The Applicant’s position appears to be that paragraph 3(c)(1) of the IJ provides for <span class="font-italic">a disposition of the 14 Oct sale proceeds from the bankrupt </span><span class="font-italic">to her</span> – and it is this disposition which should be ratified by the court pursuant to s 77(1) of the BA.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I find the Applicant’s analysis to be fundamentally flawed. The express wording of paragraph 3(c)(1) of the IJ plainly contemplated that the River Valley property was still a matrimonial asset as at the date of the IJ: it certainly did not contemplate that the River Valley property had already been sold on 14 October 2019, much less that the 14 Oct sale proceeds constituted a matrimonial asset available for distribution. On the evidence before me, therefore, I find that the Applicant has not established that paragraph 3(c)(1) of the IJ gives rise to a “disposition” of the 14 Oct sale proceeds within the meaning of s 77(1) BA; and without being able to establish this, her request for ratification is a non-starter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In any event, the inescapable inference to be drawn from the terms of the consent orders in the IJ is that the district judge who granted the IJ was never informed of the River Valley sale on 14 October 2019. These consent orders for which the Applicant obtained the district judge’s approval provided for the River Valley property to be “<span class="font-italic">sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of the Final Judgment</span>” (per<span class="font-italic"> </span>paragraph 3(c)(1))<span class="font-italic"> </span>– when in reality she and the bankrupt had completed the sale of this property a month before the IJ. Had the district judge been apprised of the truth about the completion of the sale on 14 October 2019, it is inconceivable that she would have approved paragraph 3(c)(1) of the consent orders in the terms in which it was drafted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I find this deeply disturbing. Any party seeking the court’s approval for a consent order has a duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts: see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the CA’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AOO v AON</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1169 at [18]. Not only did the Applicant fail to make full and frank disclosure of the completed River Valley sale to the district judge, the consent orders she put forward for the district judge’s approval presented a state of affairs which did not exist. The Applicant has not explained her conduct anywhere in her affidavits. I do not think it is possible to characterise the Applicant’s conduct as anything other than a deception practised on the court granting the IJ. Indeed, the further inference I draw from the Applicant’s behaviour in presenting the consent orders in the IJ with the terms as stated for the court’s approval and in concealing from the court the truth about the completed River Valley sale is that she did so because she knew there was something untoward about the transaction. On the evidence before me, it would seem the only untoward element here was that the bankrupt had purported to dispose of his interest in the River Valley property to the purchasers <span class="font-italic">after</span> bankruptcy proceedings had been filed against him, and in the absence of any ratification of such disposal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In this connection, I make the following other observations. The Applicant’s position is that she had no notice of the bankruptcy application filed against the bankrupt when the divorce proceedings were ongoing and when she obtained the IJ on 7 November 2019.

</div> I do not find the Applicant’s claims at all believable. The Applicant has admitted that she saw the “actual Statutory Demand against the Bankrupt on 12 August 2019” (see [2] above).  This was just 4 days after counsel representing her in the divorce proceedings had filed on her behalf a Statement of Particulars stating <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that bankruptcy searches had been done “on the Defendant” in the divorce proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the bankrupt) and that there were no pending bankruptcy proceedings against him.

</div> On her own admission, she had also received at her place of residence a copy of a letter of demand dated 17 September 2019 from the solicitors of one of the bankrupt’s creditors for the sums of US$1,946,789.88 and $3,762.02: it was stated in the same letter that legal proceedings would be commenced in the event the outstanding sums were not paid within 7 days. Given these circumstances, I did not believe that the Applicant would have failed to keep herself abreast of the situation and particularly of any changes in the bankrupt’s financial status. After all, as she herself said in her affidavits, the bankrupt had not previously kept her informed of the state of his business.

</div> Like the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span>, the Applicant must have been concerned about the future of her family after she saw – in the span of two months – a statutory demand and a letter of demand from two different creditors of the bankrupt, one of them demanding payment of a sum exceeding US$1.9m (see <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> (HC) at [31]). It is unbelievable that she would have blithely accepted the bankrupt’s vague assurances and gone about preparing the draft consent orders without verifying further developments in his financial status.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Taking into account the above circumstances, I do not accept that the Applicant would have remained ignorant of the bankruptcy proceedings against the bankrupt by the time she obtained the consent IJ. Her behaviour in concealing from the FJC district judge the truth about the completion of the River Valley sale on 14 October 2019 is strongly indicative of guilty knowledge. I find that she did not act in good faith when she obtained the consent IJ. Accordingly, even assuming that the Applicant is right in asserting paragraph 3(c)(1) of the IJ provides for a disposition of the 14 Oct sale proceeds from the bankrupt to her, I would not ratify such a disposition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I should add that the Applicant does not appear to have advanced an alternative case that the “disposition” of the 14 Oct sale proceeds was effected by the bankrupt to her at the point of the completion of the River Valley sale. In any event, even if she were to make this alternative argument, I would decline to order ratification of such a disposition in light of my findings on her lack of good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Ratification of the disposition of the West Coast property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn next to the disposition of the West Coast property from the bankrupt to the Applicant pursuant to paragraph 3(c)(2) of the consent orders recorded in the IJ. The disposition was void by virtue of s 77(1) of the BA, as it was made between the date of the bank’s bankruptcy application and the date of the bankruptcy order. The issue before me, therefore, is whether the disposition of the West Coast property should be ratified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In this connection, the High Court’s and the CA’s decisions in <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> were instructive. The disposition of property in question also concerned a transfer of the bankrupt’s right, title and interest in two properties to the applicant (his wife) pursuant to an interim consent judgment in a divorce suit (see <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> (CA) at [3]). The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court not to ratify the dispositions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Applicant sought to distinguish the present case from <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span>.  In respect of the issue of value given by her for the transfers from the bankrupt, she argued that the consent IJ in her case could be distinguished from the consent IJ in <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> because the consent IJ in her case stated that the transfer was for “no cash consideration”, whereas in <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> the transfers were stated to be “without consideration”. The Applicant evidently took the position that this left the door open for her to show that she had provided non-cash consideration in the form of her indirect contributions to the marriage, as well as her decision to exclude the Poets Villas property from the pool of matrimonial assets in the divorce proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I am not persuaded by the Applicant’s arguments. First, I would reiterate the observations I made earlier on the Applicant’s notice of the bankruptcy proceedings (see [24]–[26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, on the issue of value given for the bankrupt’s transfers, I note that in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> (HC) at [23], the court was cognisant of the fact that the applicant and the bankrupt had three young children, and that a finding against the applicant might prejudice her and her children. This did not stop the court in <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> (HC) at [35] from finding that the dispositions were without consideration. In respect of the Poets Villas property, it is not disputed that this property was registered in the names of the bankrupt’s brother and sister.

</div> Against this evidence of the registered ownership, the Applicant failed to put forth any objective evidence to establish the bankrupt’s alleged beneficial ownership (apart from a bare assertion that the bankrupt paid approximately $200,000 for the down payment of the property).

</div> There was, in short, no evidence to show that the Poet Villas property should have formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets for distribution. In any event, the Applicant also failed to provide any coherent explanation as to why her alleged decision to exclude the Poets Villas property from the pool of matrimonial assets amounted to her giving value for the transfer of the bankrupt’s interest vis-à-vis the West Coast property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, while a transaction may be ratified even though the applicant for ratification had notice of the bankruptcy proceedings, this really depends on the facts of the case; and as the High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Sutherland </span>(at [27]), the absence of good faith will almost certainly rule out a successful application for ratification. In this connection, I reiterate the findings I made earlier on the Applicant’s lack of good faith in obtaining the consent IJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 My fourth and final observation applies not only to the disposition of the West Coast property by the bankrupt to the Applicant but also to any disposition of the 14 Oct River Valley sale proceeds. What the Applicant appears to have forgotten is that the foremost consideration in an application for ratification under s 77 of the BA is whether the ratification promotes the interests of the general pool of creditors: <span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span> at [28]. In <span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span>, the applicant had agreed to pay a total of $414,000 to the respondent bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”), in repayment of mortgage instalments owed by the debtors to OCBC. The arrangement he had with the debtors was that if OCBC was persuaded to hold off on enforcing their rights, the debtors could sell the mortgaged property on the open market for a better price, which would benefit the unsecured creditors. In return, the applicant expected to be repaid from the surplus sale proceeds, after OCBC was paid, but ahead of the unsecured creditors. This arrangement was recorded as an assignment agreement. The debtors were made bankrupt before they could sell the property; and the applicant applied under s 77(1) of the BA for ratification of the assignment agreement. The High Court allowed his application because the court found that the assignment agreement would benefit the creditors, firstly by fending off a fire sale by the bank; and secondly, by saving on interest payable to OCBC (at [36] and [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In contrast, in the present case, the Applicant has failed to put forward any evidence to show that the disposition of the West Coast property and/or the 14 Oct sale proceeds would benefit the general pool of creditors. If anything, the evidence before me strongly suggests that the consent IJ was really an attempt to put the bankrupt’s assets out of the reach of his creditors (see <span class="font-italic">Sharon Cheo</span> (HC) at [24] and [37]). It is pertinent to note that despite the Applicant’s self-declared difficulties in contacting and locating the bankrupt at the material time,

</div> The convenient timing of these actions is not merely suspicious: it shows how much the bankrupt wanted to put his assets out of the reach of his creditors. It must moreover be highlighted that based on the documents exhibited in the Applicant’s affidavit, the option to purchase the River Valley property was exercised by the purchasers on 22 July 2019.

</div> The sale was to be completed 12 weeks from the date of exercise. There is simply no cogent explanation as to why, on 11 October 2019, the bankrupt endorsed a draft consent order which provided for a <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> sale of the River Valley property.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the circumstances, it is simply not possible for me to conclude that the dispositions for which the Applicant seeks ratification would benefit the general body of creditors.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For the reasons given above, I find no merit in the application for ratification in OS 479, and I dismiss OS 479 accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the absence of ratification, the disposition of the West Coast property and any disposition of the bankrupt’s interest in the 14 Oct sale proceeds are void, pursuant to s 77(1) of the BA.

It is for the Respondents to take the next steps necessary for realising and dividing the bankrupt’s assets.
