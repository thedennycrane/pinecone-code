<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction – The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Plaintiff, Mdm Elisabeth Maria Everarda
                    Van Der Laan, is a Dutch national with permanent residence in Hong Kong. She is
                    a writer by profession and with her knowledge and practice in the spiritual
                    aspects of yoga, she authored a book: “Yoga, A Many Splendorous
                    Path”, (the “book”). This was published and launched in
                    Kuala Lumpur in November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant,
                    Billionaires Management Worldwide (BMW) Pte Ltd, (“BMW”) is a
                    company incorporated in Singapore and despite its rather extravagant
                    nomenclature, had at the material time, a rather modest address at #02-02 in the
                    Singapore Post Centre along Eunos Road, Singapore. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, Mdm AJ Hameedah, was, at all
                    material time, its sole shareholder only director. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Mr Thomas Thirugnanam
                    Subramanian @ Muhd Iskandar Shah TA, is the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant’s husband and only became a director of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant around March 2009. Prior to that,
                    he was an independent business consultant to the “BMW Group of
                    Companies”. When I asked for the other companies in the group, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant told me there was, in the legal
                    sense of holding or subsidiary or related companies, no “group” as
                    such. There was another ‘associated’ company, Business &amp;
                    Personal Management Consultancy &amp; Services Pte Ltd,
                    (“B&amp;P”), abbreviated to “BNP” in the emails and
                    “B&amp;P” in the logo, which was 99% owned by the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and 1% owned by a third party.
                    B&amp;P have or had an equally modest office at #05-1135 Joo Chiat Complex, at
                    2, Joo Chiat Road, Singapore. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is an
                    accountant by training and worked for some 4 years at Haymarket Publishing
                    Services Ltd, London, becoming head of its finance department of some 14 people
                    after about 3 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A relevant background fact is that the
                    Plaintiff, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants are all members of an organisation known as “XL Group”
                    (“XL Results Foundation”). This was a group founded by two
                    persons, Roger Hamilton and Dave Rogers, in Singapore in 2002. One of its main
                    goals was to bring together a network of interested individuals from across the
                    globe to accelerate the growth of entrepreneurship globally. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claimed that in the last 8 years,
                    it has grown into a network across 27 countries but did not state how many
                    members it has. There were claims that XL Group conducts seminars and talks
                    “in many parts of the world and [t]hese programmes attract attendances
                    from XL Group members from XL Group’s network countries.” The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant told me that after attending a 4 or
                    5 day seminar or workshop in Bali, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    became a duly certified Wealth Dynamics Master Practitioner, (whatever that
                    might mean). This Certificate appears at Exhibit “TS-1” in his
                    AEIC:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants were the XL Country Managers for Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Some Procedural History</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       An unusual feature of this case was that all the
                    litigants were in person during the trial. The parties ran out of funds to
                    retain lawyers during the run up to the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The case was fixed for hearing from 12 to
                    14 April 2010. On the first day of trial:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Defendants’ lawyer,
                        Mr Ramesh Kumar of Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP, applied in chambers to
                        discharge himself. He had not been paid. He had given the Defendants prior
                        warning that he would have to apply for a discharge if payment was not made
                        by a certain date. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on behalf of
                        all the Defendants consented as he accepted they had been given ample and
                        fair warning to make payment and it was not fair for their lawyers to
                        continue with the trial without being paid. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant told me that they had raised
                        some funds for their defence, made out a cheque to Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP,
                        but the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant countermanded the cheque
                        without his knowledge. I granted the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     In open court, the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then applied to vacate the
                        trial dates to the 6 July 2010 on the ground that the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was ill and the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant claimed she was on medical
                        leave till then. I was handed a letter from the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant explaining that she was
                        suffering from major depressive disorder since her 4 year old son passed
                        away from cancer on 30 November 2008. He was diagnosed with cancer in
                        2006 when he was 2 years old. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                        made a plea to be able to come to court to clear her name as she was accused
                        of fraud. The letter enclosed a medical certificate dated 6 April 2010
                        from Changi General Hospital, (“CGH”), which excused her from
                        meetings as she had difficulty sleeping and “may be late at work on
                        occasions” from 6 April to 6 July 2010. The medical
                        certificate contained a printed line: “This certificate is *valid /
                        not valid for absence from court attendance.” The doctor had not
                        cancelled out the relevant word or phrase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff objected strongly. She had tried to
                        mediate their dispute twice and the Defendants cancelled the mediation, once
                        on 1 November 2008 because of the deterioration of their son’s health
                        and the second time on 9 December 2008, the day before the mediation,
                        as a result of his passing. The Plaintiff then showed me a photograph of the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        Defendants attending a function in Kuala Lumpur on 9 December 2008. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant confirmed he and his wife
                        attended the function in Kuala Lumpur but they were trying to get a break,
                        out of the country and away from reminders of their son. The Plaintiff said
                        she had spent a lot of money to bring in her witness, Mr K.K.
                        Sarachandra Bose, (“Mr Bose”), who was waiting outside
                        the court. He is a lawyer from Dubai and was charging her for his
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, speaking on behalf of all the
                        Defendants said they were prepared to accept the evidence of Mr Bose in
                        his AEIC dated 17 March 2010, they would not challenge his evidence and
                        did not need to cross-examine him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Defendants’ lawyer, Mr Ramesh Kumar, who
                        very kindly stayed behind in case he could assist the court, also confirmed
                        in open court that the Defendants had abandoned their counterclaim earlier
                        on when they applied for security for costs. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant confirmed
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     After hearing
                        both parties, I asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to
                        request the doctor to attend court any time in the afternoon as there was an
                        ambiguity in the medical certificate and the doctor should clarify whether
                        she had certified fitness or not to attend court. I stood the matter
                        down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the event, the doctor was not able to attend
                    court at such short notice, either on 12 April 2010, nor the next day.
                    However, CGH issued a letter dated 12 April 2010, which was handed to me at
                    6.20 pm on that same day. This letter explained that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was suffering from major depressive
                    disorder and complicated grief. She was seen on 1 April 2010 and was
                    started on medication and therapy for her grief. It stated that: “It will
                    take about two to four weeks for the medication to begin working and another
                    month for the medication to achieve its maximum effect. However she will need
                    grief focussed therapy to resolve her complicated grief.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On the 13 April 2010, I reluctantly vacated
                    the trial dates. Although the letter did not state that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant should be excused from court, I
                    went on the assumption that if she was to be excused from meetings, then that
                    must mean court attendance as well. As the Defendants’ application could
                    have been made earlier, I made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Taking into account the maximum
                        effect of the medication, I postponed the trial to 12-14 July
                        2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     As the
                        litigants were now in person, and given the current circumstances, I ordered
                        that the security for costs be returned to the Plaintiff
                    forthwith.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     I gave
                        leave to the Plaintiff to file a further affidavit for an Expert Report by
                        12 June 2010 after explaining to her that she could not rely on her
                        AEIC which sets out what the forensic expert told her without the forensic
                        expert giving his report and coming to court. Leave was also granted to the
                        Defendants to file an affidavit/Expert Report on the same issue, also by
                        12 June 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     I warned the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that there
                        would be no further postponement of the trial. I also told the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that he would be in a position
                        to know whether his wife would be fit to participate in the July 2010 trial
                        some time before then, and if she was not fit, he should make arrangements
                        to either represent her or to get her a lawyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     All costs thrown away for the postponement, on
                        application of the Defendants at the last minute, was to be to the Plaintiff
                        in any event, but on the basis of a litigant in person. I told the Plaintiff
                        that the costs of Mr Bose’s attendance should be hers, but I
                        would refrain from making an order till the end of the trial when I have
                        heard all the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff was very upset at the vacation of
                    the trial and burst into tears, saying that the Defendants had once again
                    managed to postpone the hearing of their dispute. However she managed to control
                    herself after a while and to take down the orders set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff then wrote three letters dated 14,
                    16 and 19 April 2010 to the Registrar. She explained she would be deprived
                    of her day in court because she had run out of funds to stay in Singapore beyond
                    the end of June 2010. The Defendants’ application to postpone the trial
                    with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s condition effectively
                    meant they had successfully deprived her of her right to bring this claim
                    against them. She pleaded for the case to be brought forward to May or June
                    2010. She explained she was too shocked on 13 April 2010 to set out these
                    reasons fully.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I called the parties back for a PTC and asked
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to request the doctor to attend
                    court. At the PTC on 30 April 2010, Dr Yap Hwa Ling
                    (“Dr Yap”) turned up with the CGH file on the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. Dr Kok Lee Peng
                    (“Dr Kok”) was the therapist, and Dr Yap was the
                    psychiatrist. Dr Yap had regular discussions on the case with Dr Kok.
                    I asked about the medical certificate dated 6 April 2010. Dr Yap
                    confirmed that they did not certify unfitness to attend court, they only meant
                    to certify light duty for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant and she
                    was not meant to be excused form court attendance by that certificate.
                    Dr Yap said she saw the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant only the
                    day before and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was better now that
                    her medication had started to take effect. After hearing the parties, I acceded
                    to the Plaintiff’s request and re-fixed the case for hearing from 7 to
                    11 June 2010. I then dealt with some housekeeping matters, <em>eg</em>, the Defendants had not filed any documents, I gave
                    the Plaintiff and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant a List of Issues to
                    assist them in their cross-examination and reminded the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to get legal representation for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. I fixed another PTC on 14 May
                    2010. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant failed to turn up. He
                    telephoned the Registry to say that his spiritual leader had passed away in Batu
                    Pahat and he had rushed there to attend the funeral. I held two more PTCs to
                    ensure the readiness of parties and their respective cases for trial. During the
                    last PTC on 31 May 2010, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    applied to produce his project accounts. This was in response to my earlier
                    observations that his pleaded defence was that he had spent the
                    Plaintiff’s money on the project but I did not see any accounts or
                    supporting documents for that issue. I told the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant that it was very late in the day. I ordered the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to produce his project account
                    documents to me in the first instance, making clear that it must also include
                    his accounts, ledgers, supporting documents, bank accounts, vouchers, invoices,
                    receipts, emails, letters, correspondence, etc to show how the Plaintiff’s
                    money had been spent on the project. He was to produce the originals in a
                    paginated bundle, with a second copied paginated bundle, for me to review to see
                    if they were relevant. He was to do so by 2 June 2010, the Wednesday in the
                    week before the trial’s commencement. If they were relevant, I would send
                    the Plaintiff the second bundle. I reminded the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant yet once more to get representation for the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant did not send his project account documents until
                Thursday.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trial commenced as re-scheduled on
                    7 June 2010. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was
                    unrepresented. Only the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was present and
                    explained that the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was not in Court as
                    she was “not feeling well.” I told the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that his wife was not attending
                    trial at her own risk unless she produced a medical certificate. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant turned up in the afternoon. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant took no part in the trial and chose
                    not to give evidence. I warned the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants that her AEIC would be disregarded
                    and whatever the Plaintiff said about the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant, <em>eg</em>, the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant’s participation in the meetings, would not be rebutted by the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant, but the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said he and his wife knew and
                    accepted that. I now turn to the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events Leading Up to the Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiff first met the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    in October 2007 at an XL Coaching Programme (“XL Weekend”) at the
                    Sheraton Towers Hotel. (There was some discrepancy as to whether this occurred
                    in August or October 2007, but it was not material. If it were necessary, I
                    would find that it was sometime in September 2007 because of the email evidence
                    put before me). She alleged that during the XL Weekend, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant introduced himself to the other
                    participants, and claimed to have had experience in marketing books as he used
                    to work as a marketing agent in a publishing house in London. However, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claimed that he had only introduced
                    himself as a certified accountant who used to be employed by Haymarket
                    Publishing Services Ltd and that he used to be a Group Sales Manager with Great
                    Eastern Life. Having heard the parties, I accepted the version given by the
                    Plaintiff. I found that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was given
                    to making exaggerated claims and could be very persuasive, smooth and appear
                    very sincere. On the witness stand, he was evasive and would avoid answering
                    questions that were inconvenient, feigning a misunderstanding. There were also
                    inconsistencies in his and the other Defendants’ evidence. In the course
                    of this judgement I will be making reference to such instances. The Plaintiff on
                    the other hand was very direct, never wavered in her evidence and where she was
                    wrong in some details, she readily admitted it without trying to justify
                    herself. Furthermore, her evidence was consistent throughout the trial, unlike
                    that of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. I found her truthful if
                    somewhat naïve and too trusting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Plaintiff obviously found the XL coaching
                    in October 2007 beneficial and sought the assistance of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to market her book and promote her
                    as a writer. Her emails to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on or
                    around 20 September 2007, 29 October 2007 and 30 October 2007
                    made this clear:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I guess life never be the same again after the coaching weekend. …
                        Is it possible for me to meet you Monday morning Sept 24. at your office in
                        Joo Chiat Complex. To talk through how to go about selling the book, thus a
                        strategic business plan, marketing/E-marketing. Please let me know.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the launch [planned for 8-10 November 2007 in Kuala Lumpur]
                        time to sit down and make a sales plan how to take it from there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To meet for a business plan at the conference cum workshop (Sunway

<p class="Judg-1">I found that from the evidence, and especially the contemporaneous
                    e-mail correspondence between the Plaintiff and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, two meetings were scheduled to
                    discuss a business plan to market the Plaintiff’s book and promote her as
                    a writer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 15 November 2007, the Plaintiff met
                    with the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants at the Sheraton Towers Hotel lobby to discuss a business plan to
                    market her book and promote herself as a writer, facilitate book and/or yoga
                    related seminars and talk shows. She did not meet the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    to discuss investment of her savings. The Plaintiff claimed, and I accepted her
                    evidence, that at this meeting, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    started enquiring about her financial affairs, her monthly expenditure, the
                    amount of her savings, her aspirations upon retirement, her plans for
                    retirement, whether she had enough funds for retirement and questions of the
                    same ilk. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his AEIC agreed that
                    the Plaintiff wanted to expand the distribution of her book significantly and
                    said that they discussed a business plan to be devised and implemented. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then said that in the course of the
                    discussion, he inquired into the Plaintiff’s financial situation
                    “to ascertain how much she would be able to and willing to spend on a
                    Business Plan to promote herself and her Book worldwide.” I did not
                    accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s evidence. The
                    agreement that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant drafted showed two
                    clear components, the coaching and promotion of the Plaintiff’s book and
                    the investment component. The Plaintiff’s emails tended to support her
                    version of what happened. I found that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant was trying to merge the two components into one to mask the
                    Defendants’ intention, to use the Plaintiff’s retirement funds to
                    promote their own project. All that happened thereafter, clearly bore this out.
                    The Plaintiff revealed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant that her
                    savings amounted to around S$750,000. In the event, the Defendants persuaded the
                    Plaintiff to invest only S$500,000 and not the whole sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Another meeting, at which the business plan
                    was further discussed, took place on 21 November 2007 at the Sheraton
                    Towers Hotel lobby. At both these meetings, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant said the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant did not actively
                    participate in the discussions. The Plaintiff said otherwise. Insofar as the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was in court but chose not to give
                    evidence, I took that against her credibility. When she first sought an
                    adjournment of the trial, she made an impassioned plea in writing that she was
                    not well, but wanted the opportunity to clear her name in court as she had been
                    brought in on the basis of fraud. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                    further alleged in her letter that the Plaintiff’s AEIC contained lies and
                    distortion of the truth which she wished to address at the trial. The doctors
                    say the medication was working and taking effect, but she claimed otherwise,
                    through the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, at trial. I watched her
                    carefully in court. The first afternoon she attended, she had a solemn look on
                    her face, but every now and then I saw that flicker of interest or recognition
                    when the Plaintiff was being cross-examined by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. She also flipped through some
                    documents and bundles now and then and appeared to assist the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. As the afternoon progressed, she
                    became more lively and the solemn look was absent. On the second day, there was
                    quite a turn-around as she was alert and even combative, pulling out documents
                    for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant when she disagreed with the
                    Plaintiff’s answer, and putting some bundle or document in front of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to remind him about some point or
                    other or talk to him so that he could then ask a question. She was asking or
                    reminding him about some point about 3 to 4 times that day. Their
                    ‘assistant’, who I believe to be their daughter, and who was there
                    assisting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant from the beginning, began
                    noticing me looking at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant during the
                    second day of the trial, especially during the afternoon. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s behaviour abruptly changed
                    the next day to dozing off, then apparently waking up and crying and it included
                    going out of the court. Lest I come across as unsympathetic, I accept without
                    hesitation that one of the most painful things in this world is for parents to
                    bury their child. It must be even more painful to watch their child waste away
                    to so cruel a disease as cancer and not be able to do much about it. I am sure
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    suffered immensely over the illness and subsequent death of their son at the end
                    of November 2008. However, they were engaged in business activities and unless
                    they disengaged themselves from those activities, they had to keep them
                    separate. I am afraid that I formed the view that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    were beginning to use their son’s tragic end as an excuse for their own
                    ends by the time of the action and trial. I also formed the view that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was evading taking the witness
                    stand after stating in writing that she wanted a vacation of trial dates to
                    enable her to come to court to clear her name and expose the Plaintiff’s
                    lies and distortion of the truth. I therefore did not accept the
                    Defendants’ version that they discussed the Plaintiff investing in the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s business plan to promote
                    her book and herself with her retirement nest egg. I found that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant also actively participated at these
                    and the other meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 13 December 2007, the Plaintiff met
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                    at the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s office to discuss an
                    agreement for the plan that they had discussed in the two meetings. After the
                    meeting the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant drafted the contract. What
                    must be noted is that the Plaintiff was persuaded to part with $500,000 of her
                    savings. Why the promotion of the Plaintiff’s book and her reputation as
                    an author required her to part with such a large amount of money on the
                    Defendants’ version could not be readily understood. I accepted the
                    Plaintiff’s view, albeit with hindsight, which was set out in her AEIC at
                    paras 11 and 12:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    I aver that they convinced me that the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant could coach me to market
                            and promote the book myself. His coaching fee was US$10,000 per year.
                            With worldwide circulation of my recently published and a next book in
                            mind, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant proposed the coaching
                            would be best for 3 years, and the coaching would be based on a sort of
                            ‘wealth building” formula, meaning a formula that was to
                            combine the marketing of the book with marketing me/the author cum yoga
                            teacher cum workshop facilitator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    I aver that somewhere along, they shifted from
                            coaching talk to private talk and began to inquire into my private life
                            and private financial situation; in hindsight they were simply violating
                            my privacy. They began suggesting I invest through [the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant] too, in order to rebuild
                            my total assets …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    had the agreement he drafted typed out. On 14 December 2007, the Plaintiff
                    went to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s office and signed
                    the contract (the “Contract”). The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant, although claiming to be an associate or group business consultant of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and not a shareholder or director
                    at that time, signed the Contract. The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                    was around then, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant could give no
                    convincing explanation why she did not sign as she was the director and
                    shareholder of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. He said that he did
                    not make any business management decision for BMW at the material time, they
                    were all made by the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said he signed the Contract because
                    his son was not well that day and the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                    had to take him to hospital to be admitted. He said he brought the typed
                    Contract home for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to approve and
                    once she approved it, he signed it the next day. That of course does not explain
                    why the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant could not sign the agreement on
                    the evening of 13 December 2007 once she approved its terms. When I asked
                    why this was not possible, given his position that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was the director made all the
                    business decisions for BMW, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claimed
                    that in case there were amendments made on 14 December 2007, it was left
                    for him to sign. This must have meant that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant had the necessary authority to agree to changes.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    did not sign the agreement for and on behalf of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. There were no words of
                    qualification to his signature. Nor was there any suggestion that when he signed
                    the Contract he told the Plaintiff that he was signing the Contract on behalf of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant only. In reality, there was no one
                    else running the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant conceded that he and the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant were the “senior
                    management” of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant at the
                    material time. If it was necessary, I would be prepared to find and hold that in
                    the circumstances of this case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    signed the Contract in his own personal capacity as well and became liable
                    thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There was some controversy over the actual
                    terms of the Contract. In her AEIC dated 3 October 2010, the Plaintiff
                    produced a document which was identical in content to the above contract, but
                    with handwriting along the sides and at the bottom of the page. The relevant
                    notation in manuscript for example stated against clause A (ii) and (C) was:
                    “2 January 2008”, against the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom
                    sessions: “4 x Annual” and against the Wealth Dynamics
                    Masterclasses: “12 x Annual”. The question was what these
                    notations meant and whether these handwritten notations were to be included as
                    terms of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Plaintiff asserted that on
                    14 December 2007, both parties had a copy of the Contract prepared by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, but upon reading it, she found two
                    points, which had not been previously discussed, added, <em>viz</em>, the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom fee and the Wealth Dynamics
                    Masterclass fees. She also found the terms unclear in that there were
                    insufficient details. These further points were therefore discussed between the
                    Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and she made those
                    handwritten notations on her copy of the Contract. The Plaintiff stated that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant agreed that her copy would be the
                    Contract, and even made a photocopy of her copy with the handwritten notations
                    for his reference. It is worth noting that in an earlier affidavit dated
                    12 September 2008, the handwritten notations in the contract which the
                    Plaintiff produced appeared to be very faint, but they were there. The Plaintiff
                    explained that perhaps this was due to the numerous times which the document was
                    photocopied by her then lawyers. The Plaintiff’s copy therefore always had
                    the handwriting on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    denied that he had agreed to any additional terms, and asserted that the
                    handwritten notes were not written during the meeting. He claimed and alleged
                    that the final contract was the clean copy produced in his affidavit dated
                    17 March 2010. Earlier, he had initially exhibited a copy of the Contract
                    that contained the Plaintiff’s faint handwritten notes in his affidavit of
                    13 February 2009. He claimed that this was a photocopy of the contract
                    which the Plaintiff produced in her affidavit dated 12 September 2008, and
                    that the reason why the notes appeared faint was that Plaintiff had erased the
                    handwritten notes as she knew they were not part of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Having heard the evidence, I accepted the
                    Plaintiff’s version of events and reject the Defendants’ version.
                    Her evidence was unwavering and more believable. The Contract, as drafted, was
                    only in point form without any details. They were more correctly termed the main
                    principles of the agreement reached between the parties. The printed terms of
                    the Contract were not only vague, there were no concrete terms or necessary
                    details. It was entirely conceivable, and I found, that the Plaintiff had asked
                    for additional details during that meeting. This included her queries on the two
                    new items – the Wealth Dynamics Boardrooms and Wealth Dynamics
                    Masterclasses added in by the Defendants after the meeting on 13 December
                    2007. I found that the handwritten notes fleshed out the terms of the contract
                    with some of the necessary details that any party would want to know and expect
                    would form part of their contract. I also accept that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant promised the Plaintiff that her
                    copy of the contract would constitute the Contract, and that he also made a
                    photocopy of her copy with the handwriting on it. It was clear to me that the
                    Plaintiff trusted the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants and therefore did not ask him to
                    re-draft the Contract to include the handwritten terms as she was clearly not
                    someone experienced in matters of business. A lot of her trust in the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    stemmed from the fact that they were fellow XL Life Members and all XL members
                    promised to abide by the XL ‘Life Membership Code of Conduct’.
                    Moreover the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants were not just XL Life Members, they were the XL Country Managers for
                    Singapore and therefore held positions of great trust and confidence. It was
                    also very clear to me that the Plaintiff held the XL goals for the good of its
                    members, eradication of poverty and ethics very dear to her heart. Her big
                    mistake was to assume that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were of the same mind and held the
                    same values when they clearly did not. And so she dealt with them on that
                    mistaken basis. I found that the Plaintiff’s copy of the Contract with her
                    handwritten notes superseded the clean copy produced by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his AEIC dated 17 March
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is clear from the authorities, including
                        <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior
                        Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029,
                    that contracts are not made in a vacuum. Contracts like the one under
                    consideration, not drafted by lawyers nor falling within the class of recognised
                    commercial documents, are those where the court has often to ascertain the
                    intention of the parties in arriving at the terms of the agreement by construing
                    it against the relevant and clear contextual background. It is clear that this
                    very briefly expressed Contract of ‘general principles’ did not
                    contain the entire terms of the agreement reached between the parties. The
                    context in which the Contract came into existence assumes some importance when
                    it comes to construing what the parties intended by the words used. It was not a
                    contract to which the parol evidence rule applies. Moreover no such difficulty
                    over the parol evidence rule could arise here because the terms were extremely
                    brief and, as noted above, this Contract did not contain the entire agreement
                    reached between the parties. Applying these principles, it was clear that the
                    Contract provided for the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, (under “A” on
                        page 1), the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would plan and execute
                        a business strategy for the Plaintiff to (i) achieve a worldwide circulation
                        of her book within 12 to 24 months, (ii) set up a marketing strategy for
                        multiple sources of income like royalties, seminars, talks-shows, etc; this
                        would also entail, (on page 2 under “B”), the Plaintiff paying
                        the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_a-p3_1"></a>(1)       US$10,000 per annum as a
                            business consultancy fee;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_a-p3_2"></a>(2)       US$4,800 per annum for Wealth Dynamics Boardroom
                            fees; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_a-p3_3"></a>(3)       US$2,400 per annum for Wealth Dynamics Masterclass
                        fees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, (under “B” on page 1), the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would arrange an investment
                        plan for the amount of S$500,000.00, (given in two tranches of S$250,000
                        each), over a period of 3 years and that there would be a fixed monthly
                        income of S$15,000 to the Plaintiff or 3% of the amount she invested and,
                        (under “C” on page 1), the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant would devise a plan and strategy for the Plaintiff to rebuild her
                        Total Assets, (not defined), to S$1,600,000 within 3 years from the current
                        value of S$720,000, <em>ie</em> plus S$880,000 within 3
                        years; and, (under “D” on page 1), the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant guaranteed that the Plaintiff
                        would recover at least twice the cost incurred, (and it should be noted that
                        there was no definition or explanation as to what ‘cost’
                        referred to).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Plaintiff agreed to abide by all
                    guidelines stipulated by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant so as to
                    ensure that the objectives could be achieved. The Plaintiff termed the first as
                    the coaching element and the second as the investment element.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I also found that the handwriting on the
                    Plaintiff’s copy of the Contract was evidence of the following terms that
                    were agreed upon by the parties at the time of signing of the Contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the setting up of a marketing strategy for
                            multiple sources of income <sup>ie</sup> royalties,
                            seminars, talk-shows, etc and the devising of a plan and strategy for
                            the Plaintiff to rebuild her total assets to S$1,600,000 within 3 years
                            was to be done by 2 January 2008;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the parties agreed the
                                1<sup>st</sup> tranche of the S$500,000 would be
                            paid on 2 January 2008, with the Plaintiff handing the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant a post-dated cheque for
                            that sum and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of S$250,000
                            would be paid sometime around 11 to 15 January 2008;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the S$500,000 would be at least S$1,000,000 by
                            2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    there would be 4 Wealth Dynamics Boardroom classes
                            per annum, starting 2008; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    there would be 12 Wealth Dynamics Masterclasses
                            per annum, starting 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There were no details agreed upon as to the
                    ‘guidelines’ to be stipulated by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant. None were ever drawn up. The Defendants’ version of their
                    guidelines was simply that the Plaintiff should comply with all their
                    instructions. That translated in effect, to: do what I tell you to do without
                    deviation or questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the Defendants Breach the Contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Plaintiff’s case was that she
                    terminated the contract because of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s repudiatory breach in not carrying out any proper coaching
                    lessons for her, there were no plans made or effected in promoting her or her
                    book, there were no Wealth Dynamic Masterclasses being held nor any plans for
                    Wealth Dynamics Boardrooms, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were totally absorbed in and
                    affected by their son’s terminal illness. The Plaintiff also alleged that
                    the Defendants did not create any business strategy for her to ensure worldwide
                    circulation of her book or any marketing strategy for multiple sources of
                    income, or to set up multiple sources of income, pursuant to Clause A
                    (“Business Strategy”). Furthermore, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant failed to deliver any project
                    investment plan for her $500,000, pursuant to Clause B, or any plan for her to
                    rebuild her total assets to S$1,600,000 within 3 years, pursuant to Clause C
                    (“Investment Plans”). It was not in dispute that the Plaintiff was
                    paid S$15,000 for February, March and April 2008 and S$7,500 for May 2008 by the
                    Defendants. Equally, it was the Plaintiff’s case that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    should be personally liable for this breach of contract as directors of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Finally, the Plaintiff claimed
                    that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants conspired with the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to
                    defraud her of her savings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    denied that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant breached the Contract
                    and claimed that the Plaintiff had terminated the contract prematurely without
                    any justification and therefore caused the entire project for her to fail. The
                    Defendants also said the Plaintiff failed to abide by their
                    ‘guidelines’. The Defendants stopped paying the Plaintiff any more
                    because of the Plaintiff’s alleged repudiatory breach in evincing an
                    intention not to continue with the Contract in or around April
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Coaching Element &amp; Promotion of the Plaintiff and Her
                Book</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Under the Contract, the Plaintiff agreed to
                    pay the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant a business consultancy fee of
                    US$10,000, a Wealth Dynamics Boardroom Fee of US$4,800 per annum, and a Wealth
                    Dynamics Masterclass Fee of US$2,400 per annum. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was to coach the Plaintiff on ways
                    to market herself, set up multiple sources of income and learn to give good
                    seminars, talk-shows and workshops to promote herself as a yoga authority and
                    teacher as well as an author. It is not disputed that these sums were paid by
                    the Plaintiff up front.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Plaintiff said that she found the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant forgetful and not focussed during
                    their coaching sessions. Each coaching session would start with the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    talking about their terminally ill son and she empathised with their terrible
                    plight. She even gave them the contact of an Ayurvedic Professor to see if
                    alternative medicine could help. Because of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s lack of focus and forgetfulness as to what had been covered in
                    the session before, she started making minutes of what was covered by each
                    coaching session to help the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    recapitulate what had been covered and to move forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Plaintiff contended that the amount paid
                    was not earned by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as it and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant provided no proper business
                    consultancy services and conducted no Wealth Dynamics Boardroom sessions or
                    Wealth Dynamics Masterclasses. The Plaintiff did not dispute that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant provided 6 coaching sessions to the
                    Plaintiff from 14 December 2007 to 6 February 2008. However, contrary
                    to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s representation that the
                    coaching sessions were based on a marketing strategy to promote the
                    Plaintiff’s book, as noted above, the Plaintiff asserted that every
                    coaching session began with the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants relating their son’s tragedy
                    and the current stage of his plight to her. In addition, the Plaintiff stated
                    that any coaching which was done after that was random, not focussed and not
                    based on any marketing strategy. She had to come forward with a lot of the
                    suggestions. The ‘minutes’ showed that it was the Plaintiff who was
                    putting forward the ideas for marketing herself and her book. It was telling
                    that the Defendants did not dispute any of these ‘minutes’ although
                    copies were sent to them each time they were made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    contended that he did provide coaching sessions for the Plaintiff based on a
                    marketing strategy to increase her profile as a writer and promote her book. It
                    would take time to do that as she was unknown. She was too impatient and
                    prematurely repudiated the Contract. As for the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom
                    sessions and Masterclasses, he asserted that none were provided because classes
                    were only to begin in June/July 2008, and that he had explained this to the
                    Plaintiff at the meeting of 13 December 2007. He argued that the fact that
                    the Plaintiff had not asked about the Wealth Dynamics sessions or Masterclasses
                    in her many e-mails reinforced his assertion that she knew about the change of
                    dates. I did not accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s
                    version. He could not give any satisfactory explanation how or why the 12
                    Masterclasses to be held over the year were to be squeezed into 6 months along
                    with the 4 Boardrooms, also squeezed into the same period. Further, the
                    Plaintiff pointed out that she paid him in advance in December 2007 for those
                    classes in 2008 and she asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant why
                    he was charging her in advance, and why would she agree to it, if these classes
                    and Boardrooms were only going to be held after June or July 2008. Again the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had no convincing answer except to
                    say lamely he had given her a discount for the early payment. I could not accept
                    that as true. I accepted the Plaintiff’s version that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant only told her about postponement of
                    the Masterclasses and Boardrooms in March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Plaintiff strongly disputed that she had
                    been told that the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom sessions and Masterclasses were
                    only to start in June/July 2008, and argued that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had no intention of conducting
                    either the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom session or Masterclasses. As noted above,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant made much of the fact that the
                    Plaintiff had never complained about this in the many emails passing between
                    them. Neither was it stated in her “minutes”. The Plaintiff stated
                    that she did not ask about the sessions nor press them for any other matters due
                    to the plight of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s son and how badly they were
                    affected. She felt for them. She was badly affected by the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant crying in her arms. The Plaintiff
                    said she was not the type of person who would dwell or press on matters of
                    business, knowing that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants’ son was dying and they were
                    having difficulty coping with that. I accepted her evidence. What she said was
                    consistent with the kind of person she was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every session, every coaching session started with you and your wife
                        sharing your plight about your son. It started with your son was
                        degenerating, the voice was unbearable. You showed me weaknesses. Your wife
                        cried in my arms. You were, before a coaching session started, fully
                        emotionally trying to get me in your plight. I come from a state that after
                        that, I did not dare to ask you about this because I was fully aware that
                        you as parents have more than my business strategy at that time. That is the
                        only reason why I kept patient…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With regard to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s coaching sessions, I
                    therefore accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    were not focussed during the sessions. During the trial, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    continually mentioned their grief about their son’s tragedy. They even did
                    so during the interlocutory matters heard by me. They claimed they were unable
                    to concentrate on the matters relating to the trial because to gather these
                    documents and recall the facts only brought back all the pain and memories of
                    their deceased son. The trial dates had to be postponed for nearly two months
                    from 12 April 2010 to 7 June 2010 as the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant was allegedly still too depressed
                    over her son’s death. It was completely conceivable that during the period
                    of the coaching sessions, January to March 2008 and then going on to November
                    2008, when the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant’s were grappling with their son’s plight and fighting to
                    keep him alive, they were unable to concentrate on their coaching obligations
                    and could only think of their son’s tragedy. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said his wife did not sign the
                    Contract because on the day before, his son had become very sick and then had to
                    be hospitalised on 14 December 2007 due to the bleeding of his tumour into
                    his brain. One can well imagine the gradual sinking of their son’s
                    condition in the early months of 2008 until his tragic demise at the end of
                    November 2008. I therefore accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence, including
                    her allegation that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant failed to
                    respond on her idea to insert advertisements in a magazine called Expat Living
                    or to organise interviews. I also accepted her evidence that the Defendants
                    inserted the wrong write-up about the Plaintiff in their advertisement of a
                    workshop to all XL members, (see Exhibit “EME-8” in the
                    Plaintiff’s AEIC). In addition, it was unlikely that the coaching sessions
                    were based on any marketing strategy, as the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant himself claimed that specifics of the strategy had to be kept secret
                    to prevent others from stealing the idea.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     With regard to the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom
                    sessions or Wealth Dynamics Masterclasses, I accepted the Plaintiff’s
                    evidence first of all that these were unilaterally added by the Defendants after
                    their discussion of the terms on 13 December 2007 and secondly that she was
                    not told about the change of dates of the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom sessions and
                    Masterclasses until March 2008. As noted above, given her nature, I accepted and
                    found that she empathised with the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants plight and sorrow and therefore
                    did not have the heart to ask or press about the Wealth Dynamics Boardroom
                    sessions or Masterclasses. I found that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant’s had never arranged any
                    Wealth Dynamics Boardroom sessions or Masterclasses for the Plaintiff as called
                    for under the Contract. This was also consistent with their behaviour in failing
                    to create a Business Strategy or Investment Plans as I shall come to below. The
                    Plaintiff’s letter dated 25 March 2008 suggesting that they mutually
                    terminate their Contract, was entirely consistent with her version of the
                    events:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since the postponement of our meeting March Tuesday
                            18<sup>th</sup> to Wednesday
                            19<sup>th</sup>, to Thursday
                            20<sup>th</sup> and then to Wednesday
                            26<sup>th</sup>, I have given our contract very serious
                        consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First and foremost, let me say that my heart goes out to you and your wife
                        and Danish. I am deeply aware what a stressful time it is for you and your
                        family. When I signed the contract I was not aware that you are out of
                        Singapore on such a regular base. Adding the two together, it does not seem
                        to be the right time for you to take on a one-to-one coaching
                        commitment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am most concerned, for as yet 3 months down the road, there has been
                        made no progress with regards to the terms of the contract, re page 1/1 A-C-
                        … and page 2/2 B.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am feeling disturbed about it and anxious as you have not been able to
                        meet these contractual commitments and, given the circumstances, do not seem
                        to do so in the foreseeable future. Awaiting your strategic business plan I
                        have taken all sorts of action … to this end I propose that we
                        terminate the contract before it seriously affects our relationship as
                        colleagues in XL, as friends and as contract partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The months up to now have clearly demonstrated, understandably so
                        regarding your personal family cares and international business traveling,
                        that the contract and meeting commitments have become impossible for you to
                        make happen. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A new contract needs to replace the old wherein only my investment plan
                        through BMW is to be mentioned, and which need to be done latest by Friday,
                            28<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I therefore found that the amount paid by the
                    Plaintiff under the ‘coaching element’ and promotion of her and her
                    book was not earned by the 1st Defendant as it provided no proper business
                    consultancy services or coaching and failed to conduct any Wealth Dynamics
                    Boardroom sessions or Wealth Dynamics Masterclasses. There was a clear breach of
                    the contract by the Defendants from the beginning. As such, the Plaintiff was
                    entitled to terminate the first part of the Contract and seek a refund of the
                    sums paid for these services, sessions and classes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Investment &amp; Promise to Increase the Plaintiff’s Assets
                to S$1,600,000 Within 3 Years</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As I have found above, it was the Defendants
                    who took the initiative to seek out information on the Plaintiff’s
                    financial position, her retirement plans and then persuaded her to invest with
                    them and made assertions of growing her wealth to S$1,600,000 within 3 years and
                    to achieving at least S$1,000,000 by 2011. I now deal with the far more serious
                    and cruel blow to the Plaintiff. She handed over two thirds of her savings to
                    the Defendants to invest and grow it for her and it is now all gone. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant confirmed that it has been
                    exhausted and they are not in a position to even pay back a portion of that sum.
                    The evidence shows that the whole $500,000 practically disappeared within 5
                    months of her handing over the money to the Defendants in January
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It was not in dispute, because the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant finally conceded it, that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant did not even have any internal
                    written Business Strategy or Investment Plans for this S$500,000. However, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant argued that the Contract did not
                    specifically require the Business Strategy or Investment Plans to be in writing,
                    and then argued that there was no express deadline by which they had to be
                    produced. In my view, this was not acceptable and untrue. Even if all else is
                    put to one side, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant admitted that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would have produced a written
                    Business Strategy and Investment Plans except for the plight of their son. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant said that they just had to
                    prioritise their commitments to family, to business and, no doubt, XL. I have
                    also found it was a term of the Contract that they had to do so by
                        2<sup>nd</sup> January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    then disingenuously claimed that <em>he had in fact</em>
                    devised a Business Strategy and Investment Plan. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant explained that this strategy and
                    plan was based on an online portal called BMW-Admall, which was managed by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. In his AEIC dated 17 March
                    2010, at paragraphs 127 and 128, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    claimed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    This online portal is the
                            “BMW-Admall” (the “Admall”). The Admall is
                            an online advertising forum where patrons could purchase advertisement
                            spaces) (“Ad-spaces”) at a cost of
                        US$400….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128    As regards the Business Plan, BMW’s
                            intention in regard to the said launches of Admall in Bangalore and
                            Dubai was to bundle a copy of [the Plaintiff’s] Book together with
                            each purchase of an Ad-Space. This way, purchasers of Ad-spaces would
                            receive a copy of [the Plaintiff’s] Book along with the AD-spaces
                            purchases and they would come to know about [the Plaintiff] and her
                            Book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    asserted that the plan was to sell 2 million Ad-spaces, and reward the Plaintiff
                    with US$30 for every Ad-space sold (“BMW-Admall Project”). He
                    asserted that the BMW-Admall Project was the Business Strategy as it would
                    achieve worldwide circulation of the book and increase the Plaintiff’s
                    profile as a writer. In addition, the BMW-Admall Project was also the Investment
                    Plan as the Plaintiff’s assets would be increased proportionately with the
                    sale of Ad-spaces. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant claimed that he
                    had explained the above strategy to the Plaintiff when they met on
                    13 December 2007. He argued that the fact that the Plaintiff did not ask
                    about either the Business Strategy or Investment Plans throughout their e-mail
                    correspondence from 14 December 2007 to 25 March 2008, and during any
                    of the coaching sessions, reinforced his assertion that he had explained the
                    plan to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    also claimed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant took steps to
                    organize events in Bangalore and Dubai in furtherance of the Business Plan, by
                    launching the BMW-Admall there. The first event was held on 4 May 2008 in
                    Bangalore and the second event was held on 11 May 2008 in Dubai. He added
                    that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant had engaged the services of
                    Mr Bose, to assist in the planning of the launch. In the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s affidavit dated
                    13 February 2008, he asserted that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant had also engaged Mr Suresh Oberoi, a veteran Bollywood actor, to
                    act as their ‘Brand Ambassador’ at a significant cost of over
                    $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant,
                    in an affidavit filed on 13 February 2009 to resist summary judgement
                    proceedings taken out by the Plaintiff, also exhibited a number of photographs
                    to show that the Plaintiff’s book was being promoted in Dubai. The
                    photographs contained the heading “Creating Awareness of Billionaires
                    Management Worldwide with Brand Ambassador Suresh Oberoi to promote Yoga –
                    A Many Splendorous Path in Dubai and India”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The evidence does not support the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s story about the BMW-Admall
                    Project at all. In fact the evidence shows the untrue statements made on oath in
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s 13 February 2009
                    affidavit. Their version is full of inconsistencies. Apart from there being no
                    written evidence of the Business Strategy or Investment Plans, and not even an
                    oblique reference to it in the Contract, I accepted the Plaintiff’s
                    assertion that the BMW-Admall project was never mentioned to her. Her assertion
                    was given very firmly, very clearly and she was not shaken at all on this. The
                    Plaintiff told the Defendants she wanted to promote her book and herself in the
                    surrounding region like Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and China. There was
                    evidence of her own efforts in Indonesia and China. She never asked the
                    Defendants to promote her or her book in Dubai or India. In the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s AEIC dated 17 March
                    2010, he stated that the BMW-Admall Project had to be kept a secret to ensure
                    that the idea was not stolen. Having heard the ‘idea’, I cannot see
                    why it is so secret or why it has to be kept a secret. Furthermore, when
                    submitting his project accounts, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    included a write-up to say this business plan came from some well known person,
                    so he claims, called Jay Abraham, and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant exhibited a portion of the following book: Money-Making Secrets of
                    Marketing Genius Jay Abraham and Other Marketing Wizards, A No-Nonsense Guide to
                    Great Wealth and a Personal Fortune (© 1993 and 1994, Abraham
                    Publishing Group, Inc., California). It was certainly not novel or revolutionary
                    an idea, not by a long chalk. In addition, when he was cross-examined on why he
                    did not produce a written Business Strategy, he said that the strategy was a
                    matter for internal management, and it was not necessary for the Plaintiff to
                    know the details of the plan. This was consistent with the Plaintiff’s
                    assertion that he had never mentioned the BMW-Admall Project to her and totally
                    inconsistent with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s evidence
                    at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Bose, the lawyer supposedly hired by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to help in the launching of
                    BMW-Admall and the Plaintiff and her book in Dubai, flatly denied the
                    Defendants’ claim of the link between the BMW-Admall and the Plaintiff. As
                    noted above, the Defendants accepted Mr Bose’s AEIC and did not wish
                    to cross-examine him. Mr Bose unequivocally stated in his AEIC that the
                    Plaintiff’s book was never mentioned at the Dubai and India launches of
                    the BMW-Admall:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">..before 25 March 2008 … [there was] no aggressive promotional
                        and marketing drive to sell the book Yoga, A Many Splendorous Path, by Elise
                        Everarda, which engaged the Bollywood actor Mr Suresh Oberoi,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I aver that the author of the book and the book were never mentioned to me
                        and thus no cornerstone in the M+BMW-Admall Investment and (or) in the
                        BMW-Admall promotion drive in Dubai and India.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I aver that Mr Suresh Oberoi was not engaged to promote the mentioned
                        book at a cost of over S$250,000/-. These statements are false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">More devastating to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s version of events, Mr Bose added that he knew nothing
                    about the Plaintiff or her book and that the photograph exhibited by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his 13 February 2009
                    affidavit as “TS-13” was indeed taken in Dubai but the headline
                    was “fabricated”. This exhibit had the photograph of the launch of
                    the BMW-Admall Project in Dubai, but the original headline above the photograph
                    was removed and another was substituted; the false headline read:
                    “Creating Awareness of Billionaires Management Worldwide with Brand
                    Ambassador Suresh Oberoi <em>to promote “Yoga – A
                        Many Splendorous Path in Dubai and India</em>”, (emphasis
                    added). When I asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to explain
                    this and how the same photograph had a false headline substituted in his
                    affidavit, he could only weakly say, totally without conviction, that it was an
                    “internal” photograph had been wrongly inserted into his
                    affidavit. Why the Defendants ever had the same photograph, whether internal or
                    external, with a false heading or headline speaks for itself, let alone its
                    appearance in his affidavit as an exhibit in support of an allegation that was
                    untrue and misleading. Paragraph 28 of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s 13 February 2009 affidavit reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To perform their obligations, the Defendants had utilised the S$500,000 to
                        invest and advance their plans as set out above. In this regard, the
                        Plaintiff’s book as well as the Defendants’ business was already
                        being promoted in Dubai even as far back as in <u>February
                            2008</u>, a copy of the relevant photographs showing the
                        aforesaid is exhibited hereto and marked “<b><u>TIS-3</u></b>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The truth of the matter is, as Mr Bose’s affidavit showed,
                    that the promotion and the securing of Mr Suresh Oberoi was to promote
                    BMW-Admall and not the Plaintiff or her book, but her funds were used for the
                    BMW-Admall project. The print-outs of the BMW-Admall site show that there were
                    many other matters being promoted on that site, the Plaintiff’s book was
                    only one and seemed almost incidental when considering that site as a whole.
                    More telling was an email dated 20 March 2008 from the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    to Mr Bose which refers to a coming meeting in Dubai from the 22 to
                    25 March 2008 where the following would be discussed: marketing Dubai
                    properties in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, launching the Defendants’
                    on line advertising mall in Dubai – www.bmw-admall.com, marketing ladies
                    and children fashion clothings, banana plantation in Indonesia, coconut
                    plantation in Indonesia, labour supply, supply of construction materials, eg
                    cement, mortar, etc, and alternative Eco fuel productions. The Defendants were
                    also thinking of setting up an import and export company or marketing agency or
                    ‘rep’ office in Dubai where they needed Mr Bose’s
                    assistance and advice. All this had nothing to do with the Plaintiff or her
                    book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Faced with this evidence from Mr Bose,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant desperately tried to salvage the
                    position by stating that it was not necessary to tell Mr Bose about the
                    book as it was a matter of internal management. In my view, this was again most
                    unconvincing and was a feeble lie to cover up his fabrication of the photographs
                    in question and the lies set out in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s affidavit of 13 February 2009. These are some of the
                    incredulous answers given by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in his
                    cross-examination:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">It appeared to me that using the BMW-Admall Project as their business
                    plan and strategy for the promotion of the Plaintiff and her book was a clear
                    and disingenuous afterthought to try and justify using the Plaintiff’s
                    funds for their own project. In the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s affidavit of 13 December 2007, he claimed that the
                    Defendants had created an “internet portal to sell the Plaintiff’s
                    book as well as various other products of the Defendants”. However, the
                    BMW-Admall portal was created in August 2007, two months before the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant met the Plaintiff. I accepted the
                    Plaintiff’s evidence that the Defendants never told her of the BMW-Admall
                    project and she only came to know of the BMW-Admall project from the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s affidavit of
                    13 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In addition, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant stated that he had sold over 100
                    Ad-spaces in Dubai. If this was so, he should have distributed 100 of the
                    Plaintiff’s books. However, at the material time, he had not obtained any
                    copies of the Plaintiff’s book from her or her distributor. As such, he
                    could not have bundled her book with the Ad-spaces, let alone set aside US$30
                    for the Plaintiff for each sale of an Ad-space.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    claimed that the Plaintiff’s funds, and more, had been spent to create a
                    Business Strategy and Investment Plan for the Plaintiff. But up to a week before
                    trial, there was no documentary evidence produced to back this claim. At the
                    last minute, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant produced a bundle of
                    documents entitled “Project Investment Accounts/Costings”. This
                    bundle was most unhelpful as it was not well arranged, did not explain much, had
                    portions missing and was incomplete to back up the Defendants’ claim. What
                    it did show however was this:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     There were bank statements of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s account with Overseas
                        Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC). The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant confirmed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant only
                        had that one OCBC Singapore Dollar Account. However, they did not come with
                        any supporting documents explaining what the payments in and out of the
                        account were for. The Plaintiff’s two tranches of S$250,000 that were
                        paid to the Defendants were clearly reflected as payments into that OCBC
                        account. But I could not tell what the sums of money withdrawn were used
                        for. There were many repetitive sums paid out, some on the same day, and
                        they were inexplicable. In addition, despite my clear instructions for the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to produce the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s ledgers, he did not do
                        so. As a qualified accountant, and former head of an accounting department
                        of some14 people, he of all people should know what was required. Yet he
                        feigned ignorance and then produced that incomplete and largely unexplained
                        and incomprehensible bundle of documents. Accordingly, I found and held that
                        not only were the Defendants unable to show how they spent the
                        Plaintiff’s money on her project or investment, there was no proof
                        that they spent the Plaintiff’s S$500,000 on promoting her or her book
                        at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the
                        contrary, the “Project Investment Accounts/Costings” bundle
                        produced by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant shows that he and
                        his wife spent company’s, (<em>ie</em>, the
                        Plaintiff’s), funds rather extravagantly. The
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s OCBC Account had an
                        opening balance of S$61,141.06 on 2 January 2008. The Plaintiff’s
                        S$500,000 went into this account on 2 and 18, (paid on the 11 but banked in
                        by the Defendants on 18), January 2008. By 30 May 2008, this account
                        was down to S$21,201.30. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant paid themselves an extravagant
                        amount of S$15,000 each per day when they travelled abroad for the projects.
                        The Defendants clearly allocated the overhead costs of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant from January to May 2008 to the
                        Plaintiff. This included contract fees, allowances and casual labour of
                        S$32,728.21, office rent of S$34,030.22, transport costs of S$12,355,
                        telephone and utilities of S$1,735.91, donations of S$16,746 and a general
                        management fee of S$20,000 per month which added up to S$100,000 for those 5
                        months. The total came to S$198,753.35. For the ‘Dubai Project’
                        from 8 to 11 March 2008, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                            3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant paid themselves S$60,000 each
                        for that trip. In the subsequent trips for the ‘Dubai Project’
                        they paid themselves the same amount – this came to S$180,000 each for
                        the three trips, (22 to 25 March 2008, 6 to 9 April 2008 and 19 to
                        22 April 2008). Between them they had paid themselves S$240,000 each
                        for these 4 trips. Their airfare ranged from S$11,000 to S$13,000 per trip.
                        They lived in the lap of luxury, spending S$24,390 for 5 nights in the
                        world’s only 7-star, and notoriously expensive, Burj Al Arab hotel in
                        Dubai.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s claim that he had hired Bollywood actor Suresh Oberoi at a
                    significant cost of S$250,000 to promote the Plaintiff’s book, the Project
                    Accounts showed that Mr Oberoi had only been paid S$18,750. This was
                    confirmed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant during
                    cross-examination. Even if the cost of accommodation for both Mr and Mrs
                    Oberoi was included, the figure was merely S$35,093.82. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant could not give a proper explanation
                    for this false claim by him. I was convinced and found that this was another of
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants lies, and further evidence that
                    the Defendants had used the Plaintiff’s money for their own private
                    purposes. They certainly had not paid Mr Oberoi nor Mr Bose any
                    significant sum of money. The Defendants claim that the entire project collapsed
                    because of the Plaintiff’s premature pulling out after some 3 months into
                    a 36 month project was another gross exaggeration and quite false. When pressed,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then had to admit there were other
                    reasons, <em>viz</em>, the financial crisis in September
                    2008 and problems that arose between Mr Bose and the Defendants. I was
                    sure, and I so found, that their running out of money with their profligate
                    behaviour was also a major factor. The many writs filed against them in the
                    Subordinate Courts, which I refer to below, is ample proof of
                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I found that all the evidence pointed to the
                    fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants had never intended to create a Business Strategy or Investment Plan
                    for the Plaintiff. I had no doubts on this score. They needed funds for their
                    own business and their plans for the BMW-Admall Project. The sad truth for the
                    Plaintiff is that she had been well and truly misled into handing over $500,000
                    of her savings to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    who then started to fund their own business plans and squander her money on an
                    extravagant lifestyle. They needed money and the Plaintiff was, unfortunately
                    for her, there at the wrong time and fell into their clutches. Having parted
                    with $500,000 to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and faced with no
                    strategies or plans, it was understandable that the Plaintiff wanted to
                    terminate the contract. I found and held that on the facts, she had the right to
                    do so when she terminated the contract in light of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s serious breaches of the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was unconscionable for the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    to take the Plaintiff’s savings for her retirement for their own purposes
                    and lifestyle. I may have formed a more charitable view, <em>eg</em> that they intended to give the Plaintiff her share if they
                    succeeded, but their extravagance in spending and the way in which they spent
                    her money militates against their having any such noble intentions. I found that
                    they never told her what they were doing with her money and the reason is very
                    clear – they were surreptitiously using her money for their own ends. The
                    Plaintiff has made a search and pointed to the many actions filed against them
                    over the years in her AEIC. There were some 13 of them stretching from 1999 to
                    2009 in the Subordinate Courts. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    said in response it was unfortunate that they got into so many legal actions but
                    that cannot be taken against them because in life that sometimes happens and
                    even Microsoft has many legal actions taken out against them. That too is a
                    completely wrong comparison or justification. Many of these actions were credit
                    related actions in the Subordinate Courts and being taken out by United Overseas
                    Bank, ABN Amro Bank N.V., Standard Chartered Bank, American Express Bank Ltd and
                    Bank of China. There were also writs filed by the HDB, Singapore Press Holdings
                    Limited and some individuals. It was also clear to me why the Defendants never
                    wanted to take part in any mediation. They had already spent all the
                    Plaintiff’s funds by May 2008 and they would have been unable to offer to
                    return anything. Hence, they dragged out these proceedings as long as they
                    could.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is well established that the corporate veil

                    liable if they had engaged in a “sham transaction” with the
                    Plaintiff. (see <em>Singapore Tourism Board v Children's Media

                    Diplock considered the legal concept involved in describing a transaction as a
                    ‘sham’ at p 802:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the contention of the plaintiff that the transactions between
                        himself, Auto Finance and the defendants were a “sham”, it is,
                        I think, necessary to consider what, if any, legal concept is involved in
                        the use of this popular and pejorative word. I apprehend that, if it has any
                        meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to
                        the “sham” which are intended by them to give to third parties
                        or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights
                        and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if
                        any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing, I think, is clear in
                        legal principle, morality and the authorities (see <em>Yorkshire Railway Wagon Co v Maclure</em> (1882) 21 Ch
                        D 309 and <em>Stoneleigh Finance Limited v
                            Phillips</em> [1965] 2 QB 537), that for acts or
                        documents to be a “sham”, with whatever legal consequences
                        follow from this, all the parties thereto must have a common intention that
                        the acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations
                        which they give the appearance of creating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This case and <em>The Rialto,
                        Yukong Line Ltd of Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corporation</em>
                    (No. 2) [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 322 were accepted and endorsed
                    by Justice Judith Prakash in <em>Win Line (UK) v Masterpart
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 24 at
                    [38]. In the present case, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant is an
                    accountant by training and certainly knows the legal effect of a company and the
                    ‘shelter’ it provides its shareholders. Given how closely the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant
                    worked, I found that this knowledge was also known to the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant who was his wife. I found that he
                    deliberately did not hold any shares in the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant and in B&amp;P and was not, at the material time, a director of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant or B&amp;P. Yet it was clear that
                    he was the one driving the business operations under the guise of a
                    ‘business consultant’. He admitted he and his wife were the
                    ‘senior management’ of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.
                    On his and his wife’s own AEIC evidence, he did all the negotiations and
                    talking with the Plaintiff and his wife, the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant, was the passive bystander, (although I have found that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> did take part in the discussions). It was the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who chose to go into the witness
                    stand, but not the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant. From the evidence,
                    it is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant who was taking the lead role
                    in the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s business affairs. It was
                    clear to me, and I so found, that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were the first to initiate and
                    enquire into the Plaintiff’s means and then cold-bloodedly persuaded her
                    to part with her money. I have found it was the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants’ intention to put that money
                    into their own project and not for the purposes of the Plaintiff or for her
                    benefit. They used the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as their front.
                    The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant entered into his commitments to the
                    Plaintiff through the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant when he was not
                    able to fulfil those obligations. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    charged his services through B&amp;P which the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant said was managing the business of BMW and BMW-Admall.com Pte Ltd. More
                    than that, the Defendants never intended to create any Business strategy or
                    Investment Plans for the Plaintiff. They just needed her money for their own
                    project, their own business and to line their own pockets by drawing large sums
                    of money out of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to pay themselves
                    unjustified and unjustifiable sums. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants were the will and directing minds
                    behind the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. There was more than enough
                    evidence to satisfy the requirements of entering into the Contract as a
                    ‘sham’ or front. Further, as noted above, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant signed the Contract in his own name
                    and his own designation as a Senior Group Business Consultant without any
                    qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the present case, I found and held that the
                    transaction between the Plaintiff and company was a sham, and that this was an
                    appropriate situation to lift the corporate veil, and to make all three
                    Defendants jointly and severally liable for the breaches of contract in
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I think it is important to note that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants
                    appeared to be continuing their activities under this façade of a successful
                    group of companies and continuing to make extravagant claims. In a write-up
                    dated 2 February 2009 to XL members, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant claims:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphases added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant has a shorter but similar
                    write-up claiming she “joined the BNP-BMW Group in 1987, [the year the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was incorporated] as Administrative
                    Executive and was promoted to Administration Manager in 1989. In 1992 she was
                    promoted to Administration Director. [The 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant] was promoted to Group Regional Director in 2000 and has been the
                    Group CEO since 2006. She is currently the Group CEO – Support
                    Services.” This is misleading in that the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant was the only shareholder and only director at the material time and,
                    on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s own admission, there was
                    no “Group” as such. Only some associated companies with common
                    shareholders. Like her husband, the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendant’s write-up also claims “she also has a passion for
                    marketing. To further this passion she is involved in Marketing with specialized
                    training in Real Estate, Insurance, Food Catering and the Fashion Industry. ..
                    She became a self-made millionaire at the age of 27.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conspiracy to defraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Plaintiff asserted that the three
                    Defendants conspired with the predominant purpose of injuring her by
                    fraudulently inducing her to enter into the contract with the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and make payments for investment
                    plans and coaching obligations, which the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant knew were non-existent, and instead
                    used her S$500,000 for their own business, marketing and promotional activities.
                    In this sense, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> defendants conspired with the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to fraudulently enter into a
                    contract with the Plaintiff and then to cynically breach the
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Quah Kay Tee v Ong and
                        Co Pte Ltd</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 637, the Court of
                    Appeal stated at [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means
                        and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is
                        constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with
                        the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried
                        out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need
                        not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the
                        additional requirement of proving a "predominant purpose" by all the
                        conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act is
                        carried out and the purpose achieved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Hai
                        Huat</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80, Prakash J held that as a
                    matter of law that there can be a conspiracy between a company and its
                    controlling director to damage a third party by unlawful means even where the
                    director is the company’s moving spirit. I respectfully agree with this
                    statement of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Here, it was clear that the
                        1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        3<sup>rd</sup> defendants were involved in a conspiracy to
                    fraudulently persuade the Plaintiff to invest her S$500,000 with the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, with beguiling promises to
                    increase this to S$1,600,000 within 3 years, and then to deliberately cause the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to breach its contractual
                    obligations with the Plaintiff. As mentioned above, I was of the view and have
                    found that the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Defendants had no intention whatsoever of creating any business strategy or
                    investment plan for the Plaintiff, or organizing any Wealth Dynamic Boardroom
                    sessions or Masterclasses. From the outset, they had conspired to injure the
                    Plaintiff by using her $500,000 for their own fraudulent purposes. Insofar as
                    such a breach is concerned, <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on
                        Torts</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2006), at p 1623 para 25-128, states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Despite the problems of policy surrounding it, the principle appears to
                        have been accepted that a deliberate breach of contract is unlawful means
                        for the purpose of conspiracy <em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Hence, I found that all three Defendants were
                    liable for conspiracy to defraud the Plaintiff by unlawful means. Whilst it is
                    impossible to lay down a definition completely and comprehensively encompassing
                    fraud, as it is infinite, <em>crescit in orbe dolus</em>,
                    for the present purposes it is sufficient to say that there were false
                    representations and promises made knowingly by the Defendants to the Plaintiff,
                    thereby causing the Plaintiff to pay over her money to the Defendants and it has
                    resulted in pecuniary loss and injury to her. There was intentional
                    misrepresentation and concealment by the Defendants. The Plaintiff would have
                    never parted with her money if she knew the true purpose of the Defendants. If A
                    induces B to enter into a contract with him with the object of committing an
                    unlawful act to the injury of B, that is a fraud on B: see
                    “Fraud”, <em>Jowitt’s Dictionary of English
                        Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed). The
                    unlawful act can include a planned, future deliberate and cynical breach of
                    contract made at the time B was induced to enter into the contract. This is
                    fraud in the first sense set out in <em>Derry v Peek</em>
                    (1888) L.R. 37 Ch. D. 541 and not that of making a representation
                    recklessly, not caring whether it is true or false. The Defendants combined to
                    injure the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff has suffered undoubted damage. The
                    Plaintiff has also satisfied the high burden of proof required to sustain an
                    allegation of fraud as set out in the <em>Derry v
                    Peek</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Points of Practice and Procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Our Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5,
                    2006 Rev Ed)(“RSC”) currently stipulate that a company must
                    be represented by a solicitor in court: see O 5 r 6(2) – Except
                    as expressly provided by or under any written law, a body corporate may not
                    begin or carry on any such proceedings otherwise than by a solicitor, and
                    Ord 12 r.1(2) – Except as is expressly provided in any written law, a
                    defendant to such an action who is a body corporate may not enter an appearance
                    in the action or defend it otherwise than by a solicitor. However English cases
                    like <em>Arbuthnot Leasing International v Havelet
                        Leasing</em> [1992] 1 WLR 455, at 461-463 and <em>Lea Tool &amp; Moulding Industries (In Liquidation) v CGU
                        International Insurance</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 745 suggest
                    that this is not an immutable rule of procedure. The former case states that
                    there can be exceptional cases and the basis of making an exception is the
                    court’s inherent power to regulate its own procedure. In that case, Scott
                    J gave an example for an exception – where a Mareva injunction has been
                    taken out against a company freezing its assets and because the company is not
                    then in a financial position to appoint solicitors, a director may be allowed to
                    join the proceedings to discharge or vary the Mareva injunction. In the latter
                    case, Lai J ruled that a company could comply with an ‘unless order’
                    to file its bundle of documents by its own officer and not its solicitor (who
                    had discharged himself). However <em>Redford v Freeway
                        Classics</em> [1994] BCLC 445, shows that these are indeed
                    exceptions because the English Court of Appeal did not consider the fact that a
                    company might have a good defence or that a director’s reputation might be
                    adversely affected by an adverse default judgement or that the company may not
                    have sufficient funds and the plaintiff’s conduct as exceptional
                    circumstances. In England, this requirement has been set aside by an amendment
                    to their Civil Procedure Rules which now permits corporate self-representation
                    unless there is a particular and sufficient countervailing reason: see
                    para.5/6/1, Singapore Civil Procedure (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007). With effect
                    from 1 July 2007, the Registrar is empowered to issue Practice Directions
                    permitting the circumstances under which a person who is not an advocate and
                    solicitor may begin or carry on proceedings on behalf of a corporation, but no
                    such Practice Direction has been issued to date. Unless this is done, the
                    position must be that a corporation can only carry on proceedings at trial by an
                    advocate and solicitor and any suggestion to the contrary in the aforementioned
                    text cannot, with respect, be right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In any case, this is certainly not such an
                    exceptional case. I would have entered judgement against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant on the first day except that it
                    would have made little difference since the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant, and theoretically the 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant were
                    both present to give evidence as parties before the court and I wanted to hear
                    all the evidence before making my decision on the case as a whole. In my view,
                    it is only in the very exceptional case, as in the example given by Scott J
                    and Lai J that this rule can be put to one side, given the clear language
                    of our RSC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There seems to be little guidance as to what
                    Courts can or cannot do when both litigants are in person. That such cases can
                    be very difficult to try is axiomatic. The Court does not have the assistance of
                    counsel. The very foundation of our procedure for trials is based on the
                    adversarial system. Hence, it has been authoritatively said that a judge cannot
                    descend into the fray and take over with his own line or lines of
                    cross-examination. When there is only one counsel present, then at least one
                    side of the case is properly presented and counsel will not take unfair and
                    undue advantage of the unrepresented side. In a paper by the English Department
                    for Constitutional Affairs entitled: Litigants in Person, Unrepresented
                    litigants in first instance proceedings, (prepared by Professor Richard Moorhead
                    and Mark Sefton of Cardiff University, for the Department of Constitutional
                    Affairs, DCA Research Series 2/05, March 2005, ISBN 1 84099 058 9, “the
                    DCA Paper”), it is suggested that a judge may ask the represented side to
                    take the lead, <em>eg</em>, by asking the lawyer to
                    summarise the situation. Experience in England has shown that counsel normally
                    outlines the case fairly, and that has also been my experience in the limited
                    time I have been on the bench.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The problem arises when both sides are not
                    represented. The judge within an adversarial system is at a peculiar
                    disadvantage because the paperwork will almost inevitably be poor, the
                    presentation of the case will also probably be poor and the judge then has to
                    try and summarise the litigants’ cases so that it is articulated
                        properly<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.
                    One is almost tempted to say that in such a situation the Civil Law
                    inquisitorial system, without the restrictions imposed by the advsersarial
                    system, (<em>eg</em>, not descending into the fray), might
                    better serve the ends of justice. The DCA Paper accepts that the judge must be
                    more proactive when both litigants are in person. The judge acts like a neutral
                    advocate but must always be careful not to go too far as he does not have the
                    advantage, as an advocate and solicitor would, of being able to take full
                    instructions. And as advocates, solicitors and judges well know, things are not
                    always what they seem on the surface.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I should set out my thoughts on my approach as
                    well as mention some of the measures I took with the parties in case this matter
                    goes further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    It goes without saying that it is essential for
                            the judge to have read all the papers thoroughly and in some detail well
                            before the start of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    It would be preferable if the judge hearing the
                            matter is given the papers well before hand so that he or she may
                            convene PTCs to enable the case to go on for trial as scheduled. This
                            means preferably an assignment of a judge to the case at least one if
                            not two months before trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The pleadings may be inadequate or incorrect and
                            the judge may want to suggest to the parties amendments to their
                            pleadings – this is, in my view permissible because the court is
                            empowered under Ord 28 r 8 to act on its own motion for
                            ordering an amendment to the pleadings, (see also <em>Lee
                                Siew Chun v Sourgrapes Packaging Products Trading Pte Ltd</em>
                            [1992] 3 SLR (R) 855) and further, at the end of the day, all
                            issues should be aired and argued before the court. This is probably
                            subject to the limitations in [62] and [63] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    The discovery may be inadequate. The AEICs will
                            probably be inadequate and not address the issues fully. If it can, that
                            is best remedied before the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    The judge should give the parties a List of Issues
                            as it appears on the papers so that it will aid their focus during
                            cross-examination and presentation of their respective
                        cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    The judge will also be able to explain to the
                            parties some legal concepts like hearsay evidence, so that they can
                            correct any infringements of that rule prior to, and help ensure that
                            all relevant evidence is able to be adduced at, the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    These PTCs will be able cover a whole host of
                            matters. The list is not exhaustive, but includes issues like witnesses,
                            documents, bundles for use at trial, etc.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    The judge is able to ascertain from the parties
                            what they say or what their case is and to put that in legal language
                            for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    The judge should see if there is some pro-bono
                                <em>amicus</em> scheme where some willing
                            lawyer can be found to assist the court or the parties. Also the judge
                            could tell the litigant in person to go and discuss a legal or other
                            point with some friendly lawyer rather than say what exactly the judge
                            thought was wrong with his case, or else there may be a perception that
                            the judge has prematurely made up his mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Whilst during trial there will inevitably be
                    some blurring of roles as judge and someone providing assistance to litigants in
                    person in carrying out cross-examination and submissions, and in effect acting
                    as some kind of intermediary in re-formulating questions during
                    cross-examination and submissions, there is nonetheless a line that cannot be
                    crossed. That line exists between assisting a party with his questions or line
                    of questions during cross-examination and conducting a cross-examination for
                    them. That line also exists on the one hand in reminding them about areas of
                    cross-examination that appear on their pleadings or AEICs but have not been
                    covered or of new areas arising during cross-examination of the foregoing that
                    are relevant or asking questions to clarify details or facts which have surfaced
                    and on the other, exploring new areas not covered by their pleadings or AEICs or
                    contemplated by the parties. It is perfectly legitimate for a judge to say, for
                    example: “Can you just help me, the plaintiff says that there was a
                    defect in the machine, what do you say to that?” In my view, I am
                    proscribed by our system of trial to create causes of action not thought of by a
                    party or create defences, like raising limitation, when a defendant has not done
                    so expressly or by implication on his case. An issue like illegality is on a
                    different footing as it is settled law that, for public policy reasons, a Court
                    can raise illegality on its own motion. Neither should a judge start
                    cross-examining on behalf of a litigant just to see if there is perhaps some
                    cause of action or issue in the wings, <em>eg</em>, to ask
                    whether a party had said something and then to test whether there has been a
                    misrepresentation when neither party has brought it up. But I am not, for
                    example in a building contract case, precluded from pointing out to a party an
                    express term of the contract or from asking if they are saying it is an
                    unexpressed term of their agreement that the work be carried out in a good and
                    workmanlike manner when that party is putting forward a case of bad work. Nor is
                    it wrong when a witness has made a particular assertion and the other litigant
                    has not challenged it or asked any questions about it to point that out. If the
                    witness says “x” and the judge knows that his AEIC says
                    “y” and the cross-examining litigant in person has not realised
                    it, the judge is entitled to intervene and ask the witness: “Look, turn
                    to page 5, paragraph 10 of your AEIC, have a look at what you said then; now
                    what you have just told me today seems to be different, would you like to
                    explain that or add anything to your evidence about that?” The judge is
                    clearing up an ambiguity which needs to be cleared up, (see DCA Report,
                    page 184).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly a judge should be free to re-cast
                    questions for the litigants as their formulation of their questions may be poor
                    whether due to limitations of language or ability or legal
                knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     There will always be difficult borderline
                    cases or issues where crossing the line is not that clear, <em>eg</em>, raising a point of law that arises on the facts and the
                    litigant is not aware of the same. The DCA Paper shows that some judges think it
                    is incumbent upon them to raise it, provided it is to both parties and to make
                    sure both parties understand the same. The DCA Paper shows a whole diversity in
                    dealing with cases where both litigants are in person. In the final analysis, it
                    is incumbent upon the judge not to appear to be discriminatory and to be fair. I
                    agree that that takes some effort because as a case moves along, the judge
                    begins to form some views. So long as a judge keeps an open mind and conducts
                    the proceedings even-handedly until the close of the case, he cannot be faulted,
                    but he certainly must be allowed to take a more pro-active part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In conclusion, I found that the Plaintiff had
                    made out her case against all three Defendants. Accordingly, I entered judgment
                    in her favour against all 3 Defendants, jointly and severally for the following
                    sums:</p>
