</div> as the entire value of his shares in both companies should not have been taken into account in the division of assets. Rather, it should be the difference in value between 31 December 2018 (the date of the valuations) and 8 June 2013 (the date of the marriage) or a date closest to the marriage date as this would more accurately reflect the values of the Husband’s shares in the companies during the marriage; the court agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The relevant law on the division of matrimonial assets is to be found in s 112 of the WC. Section 112(1) of the WC states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power of court to order division of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">112.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">1) </span>The court has power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 112(10) of the WC elaborates on s 112(1) as follows:<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The court had to determine if the Husband’s shares in either company or in both companies came within the definition of “matrimonial asset” under s 112(10) of the WC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The court deals first with Company [A]. As noted at [10] above, this company was incorporated on 22 November 2002, before the marriage of the parties on 8 June 2013. Only the last tranche of 50,000 shares transferred on 18 June 2013 from the Husband’s business partner to the Husband, ten days <span class="font-italic">after</span> the marriage could possibly be considered a matrimonial asset. The Husband’s remaining 100,000 shares were acquired by him <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the marriage and were therefore not assets acquired during the marriage under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the case of Company [B], as noted at [15] above, the company was also incorporated prior to the marriage (on 9 September 2005). Accordingly, the Husband similarly acquired his one share as well as his other shares (indirectly) through Company [A] before the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The court therefore had to determine whether the Wife managed to establish that the Husband’s shares in the two companies were matrimonial assets within the ambit of ss 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WC. In particular, the burden was on the Wife to show that the Husband’s shareholdings in the two companies acquired prior to the marriage came within s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii). The court could not see how the shareholdings could possibly fall within s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) as an item that could have been used or enjoyed during the marriage.  If at all, the Wife’s entitlement would come under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) in that she had substantially improved the business of both companies or either company during the four years and eight months of the marriage (counting from date of marriage on 8 June 2013 until the Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 February 2018).  The parties’ cohabitation since 2008 did not count towards the duration of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 No evidence was presented before the court as to the Wife’s direct contribution towards the business of either or both companies. It was not disputed that the Wife had made no financial contribution to either company. While the Wife was made a director of both companies by the Husband, nothing was said of her contribution as such. All that was presented before the court were bald statements from the Wife (and the Husband) that she was made a director of both companies in 2013. It was not said that she was a working director. The Husband had deposed

</div> that she was uncooperative as a director of Company [A] and he had to rope in his father as another director to enable the company to function. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As a director, did the Wife improve the business of Company [B] by bringing in customers to service their motor vehicles? There was no evidence in that regard. Neither was there evidence that she increased the sales of motor vehicles for Company [A]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 What was in evidence was that she was on the payroll of both companies and was paid $2,800 by each company until she was removed therefrom by an order of court on 1 October 2018 (see [21] above).  Whether she “earned” her keep (as the Wife insisted) or she did “nothing” or minimal work (as the Husband contended), the fact remains that the Wife received a salary and a substantial one at that, in the period before she left the Husband, for the better part of her employment by the two companies. Her tenure as an <span class="font-italic">employee </span>cannot therefore be taken into account under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the WC. Otherwise, it would amount to double recovery as she had already received payment/recognition for her services in both companies.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Consequently, the court did not consider that the Husband’s shares in either Company [A] or Company [B] were matrimonial assets to which the Wife was entitled to any share, ruled accordingly and allowed the (Husband’s) Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Teong Liang and Tan Hui Qing (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Sunil Singh Panoo and Jasjeet Singh s/o Harjindar Singh (Dhillon &amp; Panoo LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
