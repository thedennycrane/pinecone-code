The figure ought therefore be excluded from evidence, being hearsay as (a) the Architect was not called to give evidence at the hearing before the VRB; (b) the figure was a bare assertion by the Architect and not backed by documentary evidence; and (c) IRAS had been informed by the Architect to treat the 25 October 2010 email as void.

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Bearing in mind that the burden is on the appellant to show that the Chief Assessor was wrong, and the broad ambit given by the statutory regime to the Chief Assessor to determine the AV of a property, I find that the appropriate standard to be adopted by an appellate court is one of reasonableness and fairness in his ascribing of value. This is apparent from the case law, although the point does not appear to have been specifically argued before in respect of the PTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The question of whether the assessed AV was reasonable and fair was the standard adopted in <span class="font-italic">HSBC (HC) </span>(upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd (trustee of Capitaland Mall Trust) v Chief Assessor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 621), in respect of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>AV as defined under s 2(1) of the PTA (at [131], [136], [152] and [165]). I note however that in <span class="font-italic">City Developments Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 150 (“<span class="font-italic">City Developments</span>”), where the appellant argued that the Chief Assessor had: (a) acted unfairly in exercising his discretion under s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PTA; and (b) acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>in having regard to wider planning considerations in determining AV, the Court of Appeal stated that “this being, in essence, a case of administrative law, there were effectively only two ways in which [the appellant] could challenge the Chief Assessor’s exercise of discretion under s 2(3) of the Act, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the Chief Assessor had either acted illegally, or he had acted irrationally, in adopting the policy of discouraging land hoarding” (at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Yet, parties in the present case did not approach this appeal on the basis of these administrative law principles. These standards were also not applied in the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">Glengary</span> concerning an appeal in respect of s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PTA, albeit that it was approached by Lai J and the Court of Appeal as a question of interpretation, namely, whether committed sales could be taken into consideration in an assessment under s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Subsequent appeals to the VRB in respect of s 2(3) of the PTA also dealt variously with whether the Chief Assessor’s assessments of various properties under the provision was excessive (<span class="font-italic">The Legends Fort Canning Park Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[2015] SGVRB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">The Legends</span>”) on s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and <span class="font-italic">City Developments Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[2021] SGVRB 3 on s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)); and how the Chief Assessor should arrive at estimating the value of the property, in particular whether the common law principle of <span class="font-italic">rebus sic stan</span><span class="font-italic">tibus </span>should apply (<span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd v Chief Assessor and Comptroller of Property Tax </span>[2018] SGVRB 2 on s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As such, the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">City Developments</span> may be explained on the basis that the appellant had pursued an argument of <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>as a ground of appeal (<span class="font-italic">City Developments Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 397 at [1(a)]; <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">ity Developments </span>at [8(a)]). It has less relevance in the present case, where parties’ submissions focused on whether the Chief Assessor’s assessment was reasonable and fair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I turn to consider <span class="font-italic">AQQ</span>, as submitted by the respondent. There, the Court of Appeal in the context of the ITA held that the Comptroller of Income Tax (“the Comptroller”) had to exercise his powers in a “fair and reasonable manner” (at [124]). In coming to this conclusion, the Court of Appeal reserved any endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness in cases not concerned with administrative law (at [121]). It observed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the statutory provisions for appeals against “assessments” of the Comptroller also applied to the Comptroller’s exercise of discretion under the relevant provision of the ITA. This indicated that there was no need to have recourse to judicial review to challenge the Comptroller’s discretion. Given that reservation, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to apply the judicial review standard of <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury </span>unreasonableness. Judicial review is concerned with the legality of government actions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the lawfulness of acts undertaken by other branches of the government, not with their merits (<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v Attorney-General </span>[2014] 1 SLR 345 at [56]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng v Attorney-General and another matter </span>[2016] 1 SLR 779 at [47]). In contrast, the present appeal is concerned with the merits: s 20A of the PTA provides for “any owner aggrieved by…the [AV] ascribed [to his property]” to lodge an objection with the Chief Assessor, and for further appeal to the VRB if he is dissatisfied with the ensuing decision of the Chief Assessor (with further recourse to the General Division of the High Court under s 35 of the PTA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is also important, on the other side of the coin, to note that in <span class="font-italic">AQQ</span>, the Court of Appeal also did not endorse a full rehearing on the merits, at least as a norm in all cases. This was because regard should be had to the manner in which the Comptroller “did in fact exercise his discretion” (at [122]). It also noted that deference is extended in respect of findings of fact by the ITBR (at [123]). Such deference has similarly been shown in cases under the PTA. In <span class="font-italic">First DCS Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor and another </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 326 (“<span class="font-italic">First DCS</span>”), where the appellant appealed against an assessment of AV using the contractor’s test method and proposed an approach which included having regard to the rental value of a comparable property, Andrew Ang J noted that the VRB had rejected that other property as comparable and observed (at [51]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is a question of fact what are comparable properties.

There is a presumption that an administrative official such as the Chief Assessor has exercised his power in good faith and for public benefit, as observed by the VRB in <span class="font-italic">Poh Hee Construction Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor</span> (1992) 1 MSTC 5100, where it was argued that the Chief Assessor had erred in using the predecessor provision to s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PTA (at 5103). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Statutory basis for taxation of property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The operative provision is s 6 of the PTA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Charge of property tax </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>—(1)  … a property tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or rates specified in this Act for each year upon of all houses, buildings, lands and tenements whatsoever included in the Valuation List and amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The AV is the basis of taxation of property.

If it can be proven that the building cannot reasonably be expected to be let out, no rent would be receivable and AV would be zero.

</div>

</div>
</div> The appellant submits that this is supported by s 2(4), which also refers to the concept of rent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The appellant cites <span class="font-italic">HSBC</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>in support of this proposition. There, Chionh JC considered an appeal against the VRB’s decision to uphold the Chief Assessor’s assessment of the AV for a property that included a cinema complex which had been leased as a bare shell. The tenant had then carried out various works to fit it out as a cinema complex. In that case, the appellant had argued that no value should be ascribed to these fitting works in the assessment of AV as the hypothetical tenant would not reuse the brand-specific fittings. Chionh JC rejected this argument as no evidence was produced by the appellant that “a hypothetical cinema operator would have found all these fittings unusable” (at [117]). In the present case, the appellant notes that a similar argument was rejected by the VRB in <span class="font-italic">FC Retail Trustee Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor and another </span>[2021] SGVRB 2 (“<span class="font-italic">FC Retail</span>”) in relation to fittings in a food court (at [29]–[32]). The appellant argues that the “short cut” of s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA was not used in either case, so as to assess AV to include the value of the fittings with reference to their cost. Rather, it was crucial to inquire into the value a reasonable tenant would ascribe to the fittings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I am not convinced by the appellant’s submission that the valuation of a building depends on whether it can reasonably be let out. In my view, a prohibition against subleasing does not prevent the Chief Assessor from ascribing value to a property under s 2(1), much less s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA, for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Firstly, the inquiry into the AV of a property has been said to be a “primarily economic” one into the real value of the property (<span class="font-italic">Robinson Brothers (Brewers)</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd v Assessment Committee for the No 7 or Houghton and Chester-le-Street Area of the County of Durham </span>[1937] 2 KB 445 at 470–471). The test is whether the occupation under the hypothetical tenancy is such as to be of value (<span class="font-italic">Telereal Trillium v Hewitt (Valuation Officer) </span>[2019] UKSC 23 at [16], citing the decision of the Upper Tribunal in <span class="font-italic">Hewitt</span><span class="font-italic"> (Valuation Officer) v Telereal Trillium </span>[2016] UKUT 258 (LC) (“<span class="font-italic">Telereal (UT)</span>” at [97]). In this regard, it is no impediment that the actual occupier is the only possible tenant. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Erith</span>, the London County Council were the owners and occupiers of a pumping station and works, which they used as part of the Metropolitan sewage system and to enable them to discharge their statutory duties. The House of Lords held that the Council was to be considered as a possible hypothetical tenant in assessing rateable value, even if it was practically the only possible tenant and did not have the statutory power to become tenants of the property. It follows from this that the appellant’s submission that a building which cannot reasonably be expected to let out should receive a nil valuation cannot be supported. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Secondly, the statutory scheme and case law do not support the appellant’s proposition that s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA should be read subject to the definition of AV in s 2(1). While the definition of AV is in the first place linked to annual rent, through the definition section in s 2 of the PTA, this is only a notional relationship. Section 2(3) of the PTA incorporates an alternative determination, based not on rental but 5% of the value of the property. The fact that an alternative definition is provided for in the same section of the PTA points to the fact that rental is only one possible measure. The provision also does not on its face make any reference to rental value, or impose any requirement that the property must be let out or reasonably capable of being let out. Section 2(4) of the PTA only allows an expanded notion of gross rent to cover consideration in any form, and is intended to “assess the person who is enjoying the full rental value paid by the occupier or occupiers of rateable premises” (<span class="font-italic">Report of the Select Committee on the Local Government Bill 1956 </span>(Second Session of the First Legislative Assembly, Part II) (16 May 1957) vol 3, col 114; <span class="font-italic">MCST 1298 </span>at [57]). This would include, for example, where a premium is paid for a tenancy (Leung Yew Kwong and See Wei Hwa, <span class="font-italic">Property Tax in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2015) (“Leung and See, <span class="font-italic">Property Tax</span>”) at p 138).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glengary </span>noted, in relation to s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PTA, that the provision was “not introduced to provide a wholly different measure [to s (2)(1)]” but “intended to provide an alternative method of assessing [AV] to the one based on reasonably obtainable rental which proved inadequate in particular situations” (at [33]–[34]). Section 2(3), as observed by the VRB in <span class="font-italic">Bata</span><span class="font-italic"> Shoe Co Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[1959–86] SPTC 71, in relation to the predecessor provision of s 2(b) of the Property Tax Ordinance 1960 (No 72 of 1960), was “designed…for a property which has no rental or where the landlord has assigned a rental which is palpably low” and so cannot be accepted by the Chief Assessor (at 84; <span class="font-italic">Glengary </span>at [33]). That being said, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Glengary</span> emphasised that whether AV was assessed based on rental value or on capital value, “the assessment must always rest on the current market value” (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Thirdly, it is clear from the language of s 2(3) of the PTA, which refers to “the option of the Chief Assessor”, that he has “the sole discretion” of when the provision is to apply and in which circumstances it is appropriate (<span class="font-italic">National Shipbreakers </span>at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development (Pte) Ltd v Chief Assessor </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 785 at [19], on the predecessor provision of s 2(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Property Tax Act (Cap 254, 1985 Rev Ed)). As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">City Developments</span>, there is “no doubt” that s 2(3) of the PTA expressly confers on the Chief Assessor the discretion to use the provision over other methods of assessment in s 2 (at [3]). It therefore does not assist the appellant to argue that s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA was not employed in <span class="font-italic">HSBC (HC) </span>or <span class="font-italic">FC Retail</span>. Those cases involved an assessment of AV under s 2(1) of the PTA and therefore inquired into the amount that is reasonably expected to be paid by a hypothetical tenant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">New points being raised on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The respondent argues that the appellant is precluded from raising the points mentioned at [9]–[10] which it invoked on appeal, due to the appellant’s breach of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span>.

</div> As for the argument that there was no nexus between the building costs and the estimated value of the buildings, the appellant had clearly taken the position that the building costs should not be included in the Chief Assessor’s methodology.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my determination, the existence of a connection between building costs and the value of property is readily apparent: the addition of a building would be expected generally to add value to the property, and the cost of the erection of that building would generally influence the value of the property as a whole. Even with many years of use of the building, it would be expected that there would be some connection still between the two values. Choosing building costs as a proxy is thus reasonable, especially in the absence of any other measure. Indeed, the building costs of a property was used in estimating the value of the building under s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA in <span class="font-italic">The Legends</span>, where the Chief Assessor referred to an earlier agreement to adopt the costs of refurbishing the building with effect from 1997 in order to estimate the building value for 2003. This was upheld by the VRB as reasonable (at [32]). Such building costs also forms part of an assessment under the contractor’s test method for assessing AV as defined in s 2(1) of the PTA (involving, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>an estimation of the cost of a property which is then decapitalised), although this is different from the application of the statutory formula in s 2(3) (<span class="font-italic">National Shipbreakers </span>at [31]–[33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The fact that the buildings could not be let out in practice or reality is immaterial, as pointed out by the respondent and discussed at [37]–[43] above. The statutory language as considered above is clear that it is only concerned with hypothetical or notional leases. A legal prohibition against subleasing does not affect the exercise: the Chief Assessor may still be able to ascribe some rental value. There are several exceptional circumstances where a nil valuation could be appropriate, for example, where there is something in the property that makes occupation of it “intrinsically valueless”, such as for reasons of vehicular access or the layout of the premises; or where “the responsibilities of a tenancy [<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, maintaining a historical house] are so great as to result in the occupation being burdensome rather than beneficial in the commercial sense” (<span class="font-italic">Telereal </span><span class="font-italic">(UT) </span>at [98]–[99]; citing <span class="font-italic">Lambeth London Borough v English Property Corporation Ltd and Shepherd (Valuation Officer) </span>[1980] RA 279 and <span class="font-italic">Hoare (Valuation Officer) v National Trust </span>[1998] RA 391). Neither was the case here; in fact, there were several economic activities in the buildings on the Property, as noted by the respondent. More importantly, the Chief Assessor in the present case had not relied on hypothetical tenancy but s 2(3) of the PTA, which is based on an exercise of the Chief Assessor’s discretion and focuses instead on capital value. As noted in Ang Sock Tiang, <span class="font-italic">Property Tax in Singapore – A Practical Guide</span> (Bold Ink Magazines, 2020), the estimated value of a property under s 2(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PTA considers both the land and building improvements and “is usually estimated using the cost method of valuation which sums up the market value of the land and the depreciated cost of the building improvements” (at para 11.1). There is therefore no question of assessing the rental value of the property and a consideration of building costs was nothing unusual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the argument that the buildings would become worthless eventually, this does not help the appellant at all. AV is determined with respect to a particular period of time: the AV would be revised from time to time, as is seen in s 20(1) of the PTA (as noted at [8] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was to my mind a valid objection by the respondent in respect of the appellant’s interpretations of the Report not being put to the Chief Assessor’s representative. This is indeed a situation in which the <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> rule would operate, since the Chief Assessor was precluded from putting his response in through his representative. The fact that the appellant acted in person below is not a sufficient excuse justifying a departure from <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span>. The appellant’s position on the Report, namely that it did take into account the value of the buildings, ought to have put before the Chief Assessor’s representative, so evidence could be given for the Chief Assessor’s position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In any event, no other evidence was put forward to substantiate a competing AV based on the value derived from the Report. On the face of it, the Report put forward a value without the buildings, and this was not therefore a useful comparator against what the Chief Assessor did. The Report was not, for this reason, material in showing that the Chief Assessor’s assessment was not reasonable or fair. The burden was on the appellant to bring in evidence to show that the Chief Assessor was wrong in the determination of the AV. Given the problems with the Report, the appellant did not discharge this burden.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I also find that the information from the Architect was obtained by the Chief Assessor and could be relied on in the determination. Firstly, the appellant does not dispute the authenticity or genuineness of the 25 October 2010 email, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it had been sent from the Architect to the respondent. Further, contrary to the appellant’s argument, the hearsay rule was not offended in the premises. The use of the 25 October 2010 email in the proceedings before the VRB was simply to show that this was the information used by the Chief Assessor. It was not hearsay for that purpose (see <span class="font-italic">Saga Foodstuffs Manufacturing v Best Food </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1013 at [11]). It might have been hearsay had the email been adduced before the VRB for it to consider the cost of the buildings, but this was not what happened here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The fact that the information from the Architect was retracted subsequently does not by itself mean that it cannot be used. The reasons for the retraction would of course be relevant, and may discount the information to a degree that little weight ought to be placed on it. But in the absence of any explanation, the Chief Assessor would be entitled to rely on that information. The information was well within his power to obtain under s 16(1) of the PTA, which permits him to serve notice on “any person” in order to obtain information for the purposes of the PTA.

</div> This suggests that the figure of $593,000 was indeed correct. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Use of a lower figure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Finally, as argued by the respondent, the fact the appellant benefitted from a lower AV from the Chief Assessor’s decision to use the building costs only in respect of a portion of the buildings on the Property does indicate that the decision to use the figure of $593,000 was appropriate. The estimated value of these two buildings was also only included in the assessment of AV from 2015 although the buildings on the Property had been constructed in 2001, 2004 and 2009.
