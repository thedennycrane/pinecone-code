In view of the pending completion of the Block 708 flat, the family had to obtain an alternative loan.  Fitri agreed to be the borrower. He applied to and obtained from Hong Leong a smaller loan in the sum of $177,500 (“Fitri’s loan”) but at a higher interest rate than what was offered to the deceased and for a shorter period of 20 years instead of 25 years.

Initially, the workshop had agreed to store the motorcycle without charge. Subsequently, the workshop became concerned about the motorcycle remaining with the workshop for over a year.

S &amp; Co on 16 May 2016 objected to the disposal of the motorcycle on the ground that the vehicle could be crucial evidence in the then ongoing criminal proceedings against the defendant for which there was a possibility of the defendant’s insurance company hiring an accident reconstruction expert. S &amp; Co therefore proposed that the motorcycle be scrapped only after the determination of the criminal proceedings against the defendant.

The defendant acknowledged the possibility that the deceased would have supported his father more upon his father’s retirement. However, when Taib reaches 67 years of age in nine years’ time, the deceased (had he lived) would have been 30 years of age. The defendant submitted that it was likely that the deceased would have been married by 30, based on the fact that the plaintiff married at 28–29 years of age. The deceased would then have decreased rather than increased his monthly allowance to Taib.

He accepted that a multiplicand of $200 per month was correct but submitted there was no evidence to support the additional $100 per month that the deceased allegedly gave to Norianah for groceries. Nevertheless, the defendant was prepared to add half thereof (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $50) to the $200 per month that the deceased gave to Norianah so that her multiplicand was increased to $250 for 5 years but reduced to $200 thereafter.

The defendant’s wrongful conduct is a cause of the claimant’s harm if such harm would not have occurred without it; “but for” it. This is the threshold which claimants must cross if their claim for damages is going to get anywhere. Satisfying the cause in fact test is in the vast multitude of cases a necessary condition of the imposition of liability; it is by no means a sufficient condition because the all important cause in law tests … must be satisfied as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The dependency claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I shall deal first with the larger of the plaintiff’s claims, namely the dependency claim. The dependency claim was made under s 20 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), of which the relevant extracts state: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) If death is caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is such as would (if death has not ensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to section 21(2), every such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the person (referred to in this section and in sections 21 and 22 as the deceased) whose death has been so caused.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Every action brought under this section shall be brought by and in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 “Dependant” is defined under s 20(8) of the Act to include:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any parent, grandparent or great-grandparent of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Section 22 of the Act states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of damages</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) In every action brought under section 20, the court may award such damages as are proportioned to the losses resulting from the death to the dependants respectively except that in assessing the damages there shall not be taken into account —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) any sum paid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of assurance or insurance;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any sum payable as a result of the death under the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36); or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) any pension or gratuity which has been or will or may be paid as a result of the death.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1A) In assessing the damages under subsection (1), the court shall take into account any moneys or other benefits which the deceased would be likely to have given to the dependants by way of maintenance, gift, bequest or devise or which the dependants would likely to have received by way of succession from the deceased had the deceased lived beyond the date of the wrongful death.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Undoubtedly, Taib and Norianah as the deceased’s parents and his dependants under s 20(8) of the Act are entitled to make this claim.

The defendant’s closing submissions (at para 33) argued that there was no “loss” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Act for the reason that Taib and Norianah were able to secure Fitri’s loan from the same financier (Hong Leong) on 6 July 2015, one day before the deceased’s loan was cancelled. Nor does a housing loan fall within the ambit of s 22(1A) of the Act as it is not “any moneys or other benefits which the deceased would be likely to have given to the dependants by way of maintenance, gift, bequest or devise or which the dependants would likely to have received by way of succession from the deceased had the deceased lived beyond the date of the wrongful death”. Further, Taib and Norianah were able to purchase the Block 708 flat as they had planned and are currently occupying it. In actual fact the loan was a debt and not a benefit as it created a legal liability to repay the debt by monthly instalments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Bearing in mind the extract from <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> at [36] above and applying the “but for” test, the dependency claim of $222,000 is not proven. There was no “loss” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Act due to the cancellation of the deceased’s loan by Hong Leong as the same was replaced by Fitri’s loan. I acknowledge that Fitri’s loan was for a shorter period, a lesser amount and on less favourable terms. Even so, there was no “loss” as the fact sheets for both loans

Consequently, based on the principle in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67 HL, the court accepts that the deceased gave $200 to Taib and $300 per month to Norianah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Using a multiplier of 10 instead of 11 years and a multiplicand of $200 (inclusive of the extra $106.69 he has to pay every month to help service Fitri’s loan), Taib is awarded the sum of $24,000 ($200 x 10 years x 12 months).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the case of Norianah, the applicable multiplicand would be $300 per month ($500 less $200 for Taib).

Accordingly, I award her $54,000 ($300 x 15 years x 12 months).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The claims for housing rental and moving fees of $1,600 and $500 respectively are disallowed. The defendant rightly pointed out that there was no justification for either claim. In relation to the housing rental, Taib’s AEIC exhibited a letter dated 11 May 2015 which stated that the HDB had acceded to Taib’s request and granted him a temporary extension of stay of three months from the date of completion of the sale (3 July 2015) of the Block 708 flat.
