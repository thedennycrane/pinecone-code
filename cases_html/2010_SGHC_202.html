<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This originating summons, <em>viz</em>, Originating Summons No 206 of 2010 (“OS
                    206/2010”) was filed pursuant to Order 69A Rule 2(1)(d) of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, 2006 Rev Ed) to set aside a final award dated 24 November 2009
                    (“the Majority Award”) issued by the majority members of the
                    arbitral tribunal (“the Majority Tribunal”) in the International
                    Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) International Court of Arbitration
                    Case No 16122/CYK(“Arbitration Case No 16122”). At the
                    conclusion of the hearing of OS 206/2010, I allowed the application with costs.
                    I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applicant is PT Perusahaan Gas Negara
                    (Persero) TBK (“PGN”), a public listed State owned company
                    established under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia. The respondent is CRW
                    Joint Operation (“CRW”), a tripartite joint operation established
                    under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and involving PT Citra Panji
                    Manunggal, PT Remaja Bangun Kencana Kontraktor and PT Winatek
                Widita.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 28 February 2006, PGN and CRW entered
                    into a contract entitled “Pipeline Construction Contract for Onshore Gas
                    Transmission Pipeline Grissik – Pagardewa
                    No 002500.PK/243/UT/2006” (“the Contract”). Under the
                    Contract, PGN engaged CRW to design, procure, install, test and pre-commission a
                    36-inch diameter pipeline and an optical fibre cable running from Grissik to
                    Pagardewa in Indonesia. The Contract adopted the standard provisions of the
                        <em>Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs
                        Conseils</em> (“FIDIC”) <em>Conditions of
                        Contract for Construction</em> (1<sup>st</sup>
                    Edition, 1999) (“the 1999 Red Book”), with some modifications made
                    thereto by the parties (these standard provisions as modified, will hereinafter
                    be referred to as “the Conditions of Contract”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       A dispute subsequently arose between the parties
                    regarding 13 Variation Order Proposals (“VOPs”) and CRW’s
                    request for payments as stated in these VOPs. Pursuant to sub-cl 20.4 of the
                    Conditions of Contract, the parties referred the dispute to a Dispute
                    Adjudication Board (“the DAB”) appointed by the parties. The DAB
                    heard the dispute and rendered several decisions, all of which were accepted by
                    PGN except for the decision rendered on 25 November 2008 ordering PGN to
                    pay CRW the sum of US$17,298,834.57 (“the DAB Decision”). PGN
                    submitted a Notice of Dissatisfaction (“NOD”) on 26 November
                    2008. The reasons for its dissatisfaction were, <em>inter
                        alia</em>: (a) the DAB Decision was excessive in that it was for an
                    amount greater than that claimed by CRW (PGN alleged that the DAB gave
                    consideration to additional claims and double-counted some of the sums claimed
                    by CRW); and (b) the DAB Decision was not rendered in accordance with Indonesian
                    law, which was the governing law of the Contract. Attempts to settle by PGN were
                    allegedly not reciprocated by CRW. On 13 February 2009, CRW filed a request
                    for arbitration, <em>ie</em>. Arbitration Case
                    No 16122, with the ICC International Court of Arbitration, purportedly in
                    accordance with the Conditions of Contract. By way of explanation, CRW’s
                    position, which was based on cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract, was that,
                    notwithstanding the NOD, PGN remained obliged to perform its obligation to pay
                    CRW the sum of US$17,298,834.57 pursuant to the DAB Decision; PGN’s
                    refusal to pay that sum to CRW, had caused a “second dispute”
                    between the parties (“the Second Dispute”) to arise. Arbitration
                    Case No 16122 was commenced by CRW on 13 February 2009 to resolve this
                    Second Dispute.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The hearing of Arbitration Case No 16122
                    took place on 16 September 2009. The arbitral tribunal comprising Mr Alan
                    J.Thambiayah (Chairman), Mr Neil Kaplan <em>CBE</em>,
                        <em>QC</em>, <em>SBS</em> and
                    Prof. Dr. H. Priyatna Abdurrasyid (“the Arbitral Tribunal”)
                    considered two issues: first, whether CRW was entitled to immediate payment of
                    US$17,298,834.57 and, second, whether PGN was entitled to request the Arbitral
                    Tribunal to open up, review and revise the DAB Decision. At the heart of the
                    arbitration was the proper interpretation of sub-cll 20.4 to 20.7 of the
                    Conditions of Contract, <em>viz</em>, the arbitration
                    provisions in the Conditions of Contract (hereafter referred to as “the
                    Arbitration Agreement” for short).The relevant sub-clauses read as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If either Party is dissatisfied with the DAB’s decision, then either

                        reference, then either Party may, within 28 days after this period has
                        expired, give notice to the other Party of its dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In either event, this notice of dissatisfaction shall state that it is

                        arbitration may be commenced on or after the fifty-sixth day after the day

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Initially, CRW challenged the validity of the
                    NOD. If that objection were correct, the DAB Decision would be considered final
                    and binding, and sub-cl 20.7 of the Conditions of Contract, without a doubt,
                    would have applied. However, at the start of the arbitration hearing, CRW
                    accepted, upon reconsideration, that the NOD was valid, but maintained the view
                    that the validity of the NOD did not affect the “binding” nature
                    of the DAB Decision; hence CRW argued, under sub-cl 20.4, PGN was still required
                    to “promptly give effect” to the DAB Decision. PGN, on the other
                    hand, focused on the validity of the NOD to argue that the DAB Decision was
                        <em>not</em> “final and binding” as the
                    merits of the DAB Decision had not been the subject matter of a review by the
                    arbitral tribunal. In short, a binding but not final decision could not be
                    converted into a final arbitral award without first determining whether the
                    decision was correct (or ought to be revised) on the merits. That, in essence,
                    was PGN’s defence to CRW’s claim in the Second Dispute for the
                    immediate payment of the sum set out in the DAB Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 24 November 2009, the majority members
                    of the Arbitral Tribunal (“Majority Tribunal”) published its
                    decision (<em>viz</em>., the Majority Award). The Majority
                    Tribunal concluded that the DAB Decision was binding on the parties and that PGN
                    had an obligation to make immediate payment to CRW under the Contract. Hence,
                    the Majority Award, <em>inter alia</em>, directed PGN to
                    pay CRW the sum of US$17,298.834.57. As for PGN’s contention that the
                    Arbitral Tribunal should open up and review the DAB Decision, the Majority
                    Tribunal held that this argument failed as a defence to CRW’s claim for
                    immediate payment of US$17,298,834.57. Concomitantly, the Majority Tribunal
                    noted that PGN nonetheless had the right to commence a separate arbitration to
                    open, review and revise the DAB Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       CRW proceeded to register the Majority Award in
                    Singapore as a judgment by way of an order of court dated 7 January 2010 in
                    Originating Summons No 7 of 2010/D (“the Registration
                    Order”). PGN, in addition to filing a separate application to set aside
                    the Registration Order, filed OS 206/2010 on 23 February 2010 to set aside the
                    Majority Award. The application to set aside the Registration Order was
                    adjourned pending the outcome of OS 206/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relief sought by PGN in OS 206/2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In OS 206/2010, PGN sought an order that the
                    Majority Award be set aside pursuant to s 24 of the International
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) and
                    Article 34(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration
                    (“the Model Law”) (set out in the First Schedule to the IAA). It
                    premised its challenge and application on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Majority Tribunal exceeded its
                        mandate or jurisdiction in converting the DAB Decision into a final award
                        without determining the merits of the underlying dispute and/or without
                        determining whether the DAB Decision was made in accordance with the
                        Contract (see Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law);
                    and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the arbitral
                        procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, which
                        required the merits of the underlying dispute and/or the question of whether
                        the DAB Decision was made in accordance with the Contract to be determined
                        prior to making that decision a final award (see Article 34(2)(a)(iv) of the
                        Model Law); and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the refusal and/or failure of the Majority Tribunal to hear the
                        parties on the merits of the underlying dispute and/or the question of
                        whether the DAB Decision was or was not made in accordance with the Contract
                        was a breach of the rules of natural justice, which breach had prejudiced
                        the rights of PGN (see s 24(b) of the IAA); and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     the DAB Decision was not made in
                        accordance with the Contract in that the DAB did not apply Indonesian law,
                        which was the governing law of the Contract, and/or added new claims to
                        those originally submitted by CRW, thereby double-counting several claims
                        which had been previously settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is trite law that the court will not
                    interfere with an arbitral award even if the award was made on a misapplications
                    of the law or contains errors of fact (see <em>Government of the
                        Republic of Philippines v Philippine International Air Terminals Co,
                        Inc</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 278, at [38]). CRW’s
                    contention against the granting of this application essentially revolved around
                    the argument that PGN’s application was, in reality, an appeal on the
                    merits of the Majority Tribunal’s decision, which was, of course, not
                    permitted. PGN’s contention, which CRW asserted, was essentially that the
                    Majority Tribunal was wrong to refuse PGN’s request to open up, review and
                    revise the DAB Decision in the same arbitration (<em>ie</em>. Arbitration Case No 16122). In addition, CRW raised the
                    argument that PGN’s fourth ground of challenge was outside the scope of
                    s 24(b) of the IAA and Article 34(2)(a) of the Model Law. It is convenient
                    at this juncture to state that I agreed with CRW for the reason given;
                    accordingly, PGN’s fourth and last ground of challenge to the Majority
                    Award failed <em>in limine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I did not, however, accept CRW’s main
                    contention that the subject matter of this application was an appeal on the
                    merits of the Majority Tribunal’s decision. The issue here was whether a
                    failure to comply with a binding but not final DAB Decision made under cl 20 of
                    the Conditions of Contract could be enforced by reference to arbitration under
                    sub-cl 20.6. An important question relating to the issue here (just like the
                    query raised in <em>Lesotho Highlands Development Authority v
                        Impregilo SpA</em> [2005] UKHL 43 at [24] under the UK
                    Arbitration Act 1996 (Chapter 23)) was whether the Majority Tribunal purported
                    to exercise a power which it did not have. In other words, did the Majority
                    Tribunal act in excess of its powers in making, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the direction in the Majority Award that PGN was to pay CRW
                    the sum of US$17,298.834.57? This question will be considered later under
                    PGN’s first ground of challenge, which is based on Article 34(2)(iii) of
                    the Model Law (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> to <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Features of cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Before going into the main grounds of my
                    decision, an overview of the features of cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract is
                    beneficial for a proper understanding of the contractual framework for resolving
                    disputes between the parties. The procedure for dispute resolutions by the DAB
                    under cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract comprises various specific steps, and
                    the debate here concerned the last step, namely, the admissibility of a
                    reference to international arbitration of <em>any</em>
                    dispute in respect of which the DAB decision in question was not “final
                    and binding” and which dispute had not been settled amicably (see sub-cl
                    20.6 at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I should first mention sub-cl 20.7 of the
                    Conditions of Contract, which deals with the situation where a party fails to
                    comply with a DAB decision. Sub-cl 20.7 is confined to the enforcement by means
                    of an arbitral award of a DAB decision which has become “final and
                    binding” in that no party has given a notice of dissatisfaction within 28
                    days after receipt of that decision, and a party fails to comply with the DAB
                    decision against it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The narrow scope of sub-cl 20.7 is highlighted
                    in the leading textbook by Baker, Mellors, Chalmers &amp; Lavers, <em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and Practice</em> (Informa, London 2009)
                        (“<em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and
                    Practice</em>”) at paras 9.164-9.165, which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Enforcement of a decision of the DAB</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.164   Although the
                            decision of a DAB is binding on the Parties and they are required to
                            give effect to … it [1999 Red Book, sub-clause 20.4], promptly,
                            one Party may nevertheless refuse to implement it. When the DAB gives a
                            decision, the following outcomes are possible:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Neither Party gives notice of dissatisfaction,
                                so that the decision becomes final and binding. Both Parties accept
                                and implement it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Neither Party gives notice of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.165   In outcome (i), there is obviously no need for
                            either Party to enforce the decision. However, in outcomes (ii) and
                            (iii), such a failure to comply with a decision once it has become
                            binding may be enforced by reference to arbitration. Enforcement of
                            decisions at arbitration is considered further in para. 9.217 <em>et seq</em> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, paras 9.217 – 9.218 are also
                    relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Enforcement of a DAB’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.217   Although a decision of the DAB on a dispute is
                            binding on the Parties, and they are obliged under Sub-Clause
                            20.4… ‘promptly’ to give effect to it, the Party in
                            whose favour the decision is given may wish to seek to enforce the
                            decision if the other Party does not comply with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Final and binding decision</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.218   Under Sub-Clause 20.7…a Party may refer
                            to arbitration the failure of the other Party to comply with a <em>final</em> and binding DAB decision. This Sub-Clause
                            expressly excludes the application of Sub-Clauses 20.4 and 20.5 …
                            to such a reference. Thus, the failure to comply with the decision of
                            the DAB may be referred directly to arbitration as soon as the decision
                            has become final, without any need for the failure itself to be referred
                            back to the DAB or having to wait for 56 days…to attempt to reach
                            an amicable settlement in relation to the failure to comply. Such a
                            reference would be by the Party in whose favour the DAB’s decision
                            had been made, seeking not to change, but to enforce it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As can be seen from the above commentary on
                    sub-cl 20.7, any reference of a DAB decision to international arbitration on the
                    basis of a failure to comply with that decision is admissible where the decision
                    is “final and binding”. In the present case, it is common ground
                    that the DAB Decision had not become “final and binding” because
                    PGN had filed a valid NOD. It is also common ground that by virtue of sub-cl
                    20.4, the DAB Decision was “binding” even if it were not
                    “final” (as evident from the phrase “[t]he decision shall
                    be binding” in sub cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract). What then, in
                    the face of a valid NOD, can the party in whose favour a binding but not final
                    DAB decision was made (a “winning party”) do to enforce that
                    decision when the other party (the “losing party”) fails to give
                    prompt effect to it as required by sub-cl 20.4 of the 1999 Red
                Book?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There appears to be a lacuna or gap in the
                    1999 Red Book in so far as it does not confer an express right on a winning
                    party to refer to arbitration a failure of the losing party to comply with a DAB
                    decision that is “binding” but not “final” in
                    nature. This lacuna or gap in sub-cl 20.7 was highlighted by Prof Nael G Bunni
                    in his article, “The Gap in Sub-Clause 20.7 of the 1999 FIDIC Contracts
                    for Major Work” [2005] ICLR 272. In his article, Prof Bunni
                    notes that cl 20 of the 1999 Red Book does not expressly confer a right on a
                    winning party to refer to arbitration a failure of the losing party to comply
                    with a DAB decision that is binding but not final. This situation arises where
                    the losing party fails to “promptly give effect” to the DAB
                    decision made against it. Prof Bunni rightly notes that “there is no
                    solution offered within cl 20 other than simply treating the non-compliant party
                    as being in breach of contract” (at p 272). Suing in contract for
                    breach may not be the best practical move for the winning party, especially when
                    the decision only relates to payment of money. The winning party may need to
                    prove damages, which may be no more than a claim for interests on the sum owing.
                    Prof Bunni suggests in his article that one solution could be to amend sub-cl
                    20.7 and sub-cl 20.6 so as to allow relief by arbitration regardless of whether
                    or not a NOD has been filed and whether or not the DAB decision in question has
                    become final (at p 281). He suggests removing the phrase “final and
                    binding” such that the provision reads as follows (at p 281):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.7 Failure to Comply with Dispute Adjudication Board’s
                        Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that a Party fails to comply with the Decision of the Dispute
                        Adjudication Board, then the other Party may, without prejudice to any other
                        rights it may have, refer the failure itself to arbitration under Sub-Clause
                        20.6 [Arbitration]. Sub-clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication
                        Board’s Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.5 [Amicable Settlement] shall not
                        apply to this reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this way, Prof Bunni states, with the appropriate amendments, the
                    winning party can treat the non-compliance of the losing party as a
                    “dispute” within the arbitration agreement, and then obtain an
                    arbitral award in the form of a declaration that the losing party is to give
                    effect to the decision by the DAB (at p 282).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The 1999 Red Book can be compared with the
                        <em>FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Design, Build and
                        Operate Projects</em> (1<sup>st</sup> ed, 2008)
                    (“the Gold Book”). <em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and
                        Practice</em> at para 9.219 explains that under sub-cl 20.9 of
                    the Gold Book, the right of a winning party to refer directly to arbitration a
                    failure of the losing party to comply with a decision of the DAB is not
                    dependent on whether the decision has become final. As stated in sub-cl 20.9 of
                    the Gold Book:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that a Party fails to comply with any decision of the DAB,
                        whether binding or final and binding, then the other Party may, without
                        prejudice to any other rights it may have, refer the failure itself to
                        arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.8 [<em>Arbitration</em>] for summary or other expedited relief, as may be
                        appropriate. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for PGN, Mr Philip Jeyaretnam SC, observed this to mean
                    that if the form of the parties’ contract was the standard form set out in
                    the Gold Book, an award would be given “temporary finality”
                    pursuant to a power granted by the arbitration agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In his words, the Gold Book
                    provides for a “contractually mandated award with temporary
                    finality” and, effectively, “the same tribunal [is not precluded]
                    from returning to the same issues that it would, necessarily, have specifically
                    reserved for its own further consideration on the full
                        merits.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In contrast, the
                    1999 Red Book (like in this present case) does not contain such an express right
                    and power as described. Notably, the gap in sub-cl 20.7 as originally identified
                    by Prof Bunni is acknowledged by Jeremy Glover and Simon Hughes as real in their
                    textbook <em>Understanding The New FIDIC Red Book</em>,
                        <em>A Clause By Clause Commentary</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, London 2006) (“<em>The New FIDIC Red
                        Book</em>”) at para 20-053 in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sub-clause 20.7 only deals with the situation where both parties are
                        satisfied with the DAB decision. If not (i.e. if a Notice of Dissatisfaction
                        has been served) then there is no immediate recourse for the aggrieved party
                        to ensure the DAB decision can be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Continuing, the authors of <em>The New FIDIC Red Book</em> (at para 20-054) highlight the
                    differences between sub-cll 20.6 and 20.7 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Note that the arbitral proceedings envisaged by sub-cl. 20.7 are quite
                        distinct from those under sub-cl. 20.6. Whereas sub-cl. 20.6 provides for a
                        fresh procedure to decide the merits of the dispute between the parties, the
                        only purpose of sub-cl 20.7 is to enable the enforcement of a DAB decision,
                        without considering the substantial dispute between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     
          <em>The New FIDIC Red
                        Book</em> also contains excerpts of the FIDIC Multilateral Development
                    Bank Harmonised Edition (“the Harmonised Version”) first published
                    in May 2005 and subsequently amended in March 2006. By way of background, FIDIC
                    had worked with the representatives of the Multilateral Development Bank
                    (“MDB”) to produce this MDB Harmonised Edition, which is a
                    modified form of the 1999 Red Book, for use in MDB projects. Although the
                    Harmonised Version is largely more applicable to multilateral development banks,
                    we can nonetheless take note that the drafters of the Harmonised Version left
                    the gap identified in sub-cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book in the Harmonised
                    Version. Sub-cl 20.7 of the Harmonised Version, the text of which is set out
                    below, continues to make the “final and binding” nature of the
                    dispute board decision concerned a pre-condition to the enforcement of that
                    decision by way of an arbitral award. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event that a Party fails to comply with a <em>final
                            and binding</em> DB [Dispute Board] decision, then the other Party
                        may, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, refer the failure
                        itself to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 [<em>Arbitration</em>]. Sub-clause 20.4 [<em>Obtaining
                            Dispute Board’s Decision</em>] and Sub-Clause 20.5
                            [<em>Amicable Settlement</em>] shall not apply to
                        this reference. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This, in substance, is not different from
                    sub-cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book. In contrast, Prof Bunni’s suggested
                    amendment in his article to sub-cl 20.7 to plug the gap, so to speak, by
                    allowing a binding but not final decision to be referred to arbitration is wider
                    (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     From the plain wording of sub-cl 20.7 of the
                    Harmonised Version, it is clear that its drafters decided to retain the
                    distinction between the arbitral proceedings envisaged by sub-cl 20.7 and those
                    envisaged by sub-cl 20.6 (see para 20-054 of <em>The New
                        FIDIC Red Book</em> which is referred to in <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above) and, in doing so, implicitly rejected Prof
                    Bunni’s suggestion to allow the winning party to refer to arbitration a
                    failure of the losing party to comply with a DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Returning to the 1999 Red Book, Prof Bunni in
                    his article questioned, in the context of the 1999 Red Book (like the present
                    case), what the situation would be if the arbitration were on the <em>narrow issue</em> of whether or not a party ought to have
                    complied with the DAB decision in question and the non-compliant party submitted
                    in its defence a challenge to the reasoning contained in the decision by the DAB
                    (at p 282). This was precisely the situation in OS 206/2010: PGN’s
                    defence to CRW’s claim for immediate payment of the sum owing under the
                    DAB Decision was, <em>inter alia, the non- adherence to the
                        procedure under sub-cl 20.6 to decide the merits of the dispute between the
                        parties</em>. Prof Bunni answered his own question by stating that
                    depending on the applicable law of the contract, the relevant arbitration rules
                    and the parties’ submissions, the arbitral tribunal might issue a
                    provisional award on that issue, pending a final award on the dispute at large
                    (at pp 282 - 283).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In fact, Prof Bunni’s suggestion of a
                    provisional award was considered in ICC Case No 10619, which was decided a
                    few years before the publication of Prof Bunni’s article. The award in
                    that case (“the interim award in ICC Case No 10619”) was made
                    in 2001, but has only recently been published by the ICC (see ICC International
                    Court of Arbitration Bulletin, Volume 19, No 2 – 2008, p 85 to
                    90). ICC Case No 10619 dealt with the enforcement of a decision by the
                    engineer (“the Engineer”) made under cl 67 of the FIDIC Conditions
                    of Contract for Works of Civil Engineering Construction
                        (4<sup>th</sup> edition, 1987), a clause analogous to cl 20
                    of the 1999 Red Book. In that case, a tribunal of three arbitrators held
                    unanimously that notwithstanding a NOD had been given, the decision by the
                    Engineer was binding and would be enforced by an interim award to the effect
                    that the sum owing pursuant to the Engineer’s decision was immediately
                    payable by the losing party pending arbitration on the merits of the underlying
                    dispute. The arbitral tribunal in ICC Case No 10619 reasoned that the legal
                    basis on which it could adjudicate on the dispute and issue an interim award lay
                    in contract law, <em>viz</em>, that the parties had agreed
                    in contract that the Engineer’s decision was to have an immediate binding
                    effect (see the interim award in ICC Case No 10619 at para 22). ICC
                    Case No 10619 appeared to be the first case of its kind (at least among the
                    decisions that were reported) where an ICC arbitral tribunal directly enforced,
                    by means of an interim award, a binding but not final decision of the
                    Engineer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Referring to ICC Case No 10619, <em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and Practice</em> notes in
                    para 9.220:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Binding but not final decision</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.220   The [1999 Red Book] do[es] not contain an
                            express right of a Party to refer to arbitration a failure of the other
                            Party to comply with a decision of the DAB where notice of a
                            dissatisfaction has been given by either Party. It is, however,
                            suggested that a Party may <em>include in an arbitration
                                commenced under Sub-Clause 20.6 a claim for an interim award to
                                enforce the decision of the DAB, pending a final resolution of the
                                dispute by the Arbitral Tribunal</em> [referring to ICC Case
                            No 10619]. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Attention should be given to the phrase “arbitration
                    commenced under Sub-Clause 20.6” (italicised for emphasis above) and the
                    authors’ suggestion to include “in the reference for arbitration a
                    claim for an interim award” to enforce the decision of the DAB pending
                    final resolution of the dispute by the arbitral tribunal. To repeat, both Prof
                    Bunni and para 9.220 of <em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and
                        Practice</em> recognise that cl 20 of the 1999 Red Book does not
                    expressly allow arbitration of a “binding but not final” decision
                    of the DAB <em>per se</em>. Arbitration is allowed only for
                    (a) “final and binding” decisions under sub-cl 20.7 (for
                    enforcement of the decision of the DAB), and (b) decisions that have <em>not</em> become “final and binding” under
                    sub-cl 20.6 (where the purpose of the arbitration is to, <em>inter alia</em>, review and revise the decision of the DAB). It must
                    be remembered that, first, the request for arbitration in ICC Case No 10619
                    covered a mixture of several complaints such as delays and disruptions arising
                    from design and other associated causes, failure of the employer to grant
                    possession of the site to the claimant, as well as breaches of contract. After
                    the employer’s answer was filed, the claimant declared its intention to
                    request the arbitral tribunal to render an interim award to give effect to the
                    Engineer’s decisions pending arbitration and an order that the employer
                    immediately pay the amounts determined by the Engineer as an advance payment.
                    Second, the arbitral tribunal did review the facts relating to the
                    Engineer’s decisions before considering the issue of “whether and
                    on what legal basis the Tribunal might adjudicate the present dispute by an
                    interim award” (see Christopher R Seppala – “Enforcement by
                    an arbitral award of a binding but not final Engineer’s or DAB’s
                    decision under the FIDIC Conditions” - ICLR [2009] 414 at
                    p 420).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     What CRW was seeking by the arbitration in
                    Arbitration Case No 16122 was <em>not</em> an interim
                    or provisional payment of the sum set out in the DAB Decision pending a
                    resolution of the review of the DAB Decision. That was what happened in ICC Case
                    No 10619, but it was not so in the present case. CRW’s complaint in
                    effect was about PGN’s breach of cl 20.4. I will elaborate on this below
                    when discussing the ground for setting aside the Majority Award under Article
                    34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. Suffice it to say for present purposes that
                    Mr Jeyaretnam argued that whilst the immediate binding effect (as between
                    the parties) of a DAB decision was what sub-cl 20.4 of the Conditions of
                    Contract stipulated, the finality of that DAB decision without it being first
                    reviewed on its merits in the light of a valid NOD was not something envisaged
                    by sub-cll 20.6 and 20.7 of the Conditions of Contract. CRW, so PGN’s
                    argument developed, had erroneously conflated the provisions of sub-cll 20.6 and
                    20.7 in its reference to the Arbitral Tribunal. Furthermore, by issuing a
                        <em>final award</em>, the Majority Tribunal had made
                    the DAB Decision “final and binding” and had, therefore, acted
                    outside its powers conferred by the Arbitration Agreement. Put another way,
                    PGN’s contention was that the Majority Tribunal had assumed a power which
                    it did not have under the Arbitration Agreement and had ignored the provisions
                    of the Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                                    beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided

                                    arbitration may be set aside…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Two situations may fall within the
                    ambit of Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. The first contemplates the
                    typical common situation where an award is made by a tribunal that had
                    jurisdiction to deal with the dispute, but exceeded its powers by dealing with
                    matters that had not been submitted to it (see Nigel Blackaby, Constantine
                    Partasides with Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter, <em>Redfern and
                        Hunter on International Arbitration</em> (“<em>Redfern and Hunter</em>”)(Oxford University Press, Fifth Ed,
                    2009 at para 10.39). This first situation, as just described, arose and was
                    considered in, for example, <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia
                        (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597. The
                    second situation is where the dispute referred to the arbitrators is one that
                    was not within the parties’ arbitration agreement or that went beyond the
                    scope of that agreement. In the present proceedings, the parties did not refer
                    me to any case concerning the second situation. However some guidance can be
                    drawn from cases on Article V(1)(c) of the 1958 Convention on the Recognition
                    and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“the New York
                    Convention”), which is analogous to Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model
                    Law. Article V(1)(c) of the New York Convention, which is set out in the Second
                    Schedule of the IAA, reads as follows:</p>

                    was not within the arbitration agreement. In that case, the parties entered into
                    a contract which required the respondent to provide a letter of credit. The said
                    letter of credit was never provided and the claimant sued for non-payment. The
                    arbitrators rendered an award in favour of the claimant. The respondent,
                    however, resisted enforcement, by successfully arguing that the arbitral clause,
                    which stated that “[a]ll disputes as to quality or condition of rubber or
                    other dispute arising under these contract regulations shall be settled by
                    Arbitration”, only covered claims based on the quality, size and/or
                    weight of the goods concerned, and consequently, the clause did not give the
                    arbitrators the power to render an award pertaining to the consequences of the
                    non-opening of the stipulated letter of credit. Likewise, the situation that I
                    was concerned with here was of a dispute that was not within the Arbitration
                    Agreement, or that it went beyond the scope of that agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “dispute” that was referred to
                arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As stated, an arbitration clause defines the
                    scope of the dispute that may be referred to arbitration including the powers of
                    the arbitrators. Whether a dispute falls within an arbitration clause in a
                    contract must depend on first, what the dispute is about and second, the kinds
                    of disputes which the arbitration clause covers (see <em>Heyman v
                        Darwins Ltd</em> [1942] AC 356 at 360 which was accepted by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>S A Shee &amp; Co (Pte) Ltd v Kaki
                        Bukit Industrial Park Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 192
                    at [30]). Notably, the arbitration commenced by CRW in Arbitration Case
                    No 16122 was made under sub-cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract, which
                    bears repeating. Sub-cl 20.6 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless settled amicably, <em>any dispute in respect of
                            which the DAB’s decision</em> (if any) has not become final
                        and binding shall be finally settled by international arbitration. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A particular feature of sub-cl 20.6 is that
                    before a dispute can be subject to arbitration, it must first have been referred
                    to the DAB (see <em>The New FIDIC Red Book</em> at
                    para 20-046). The opening words of the first sentence of sub-cl 20.6
                    (quoted in <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above) makes clear that a
                    “dispute” that may be submitted to arbitration under sub-cl 20.6
                    is one that has been referred to the DAB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the present case, the
                    “dispute” which CRW wanted the Arbitral Tribunal to resolve
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Second Dispute) was whether CRW was
                    entitled to <em>immediate</em> repayment by PGN of the sum
                    set out in the DAB Decision. There was no quarrel that such a dispute regarding
                    the immediate enforceability of the DAB Decision was <em>not</em> a dispute relating to the DAB Decision. To reiterate, the
                    disputes decided by the DAB Decision were the same disputes in respect of which
                    NOD had been given. By its own admission, CRW had characterised PGN’s
                    non-payment of the sum set out in the DAB Decision as a “second”
                    dispute on account of the binding nature of the DAB Decision, and coupled with
                    PGN’s breach in refusing to promptly pay the invoice raised by CRW on
                    3 December 2008 for the sum of US$17,298,834.57 in accordance with the DAB
                        Decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The relevant portion of
                    the text of the invoice states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to put into effect [sub-cl 20.4] of the Contract [CRW] hereby
                        submit (sic) Invoice Number 55/X11/CRW/08 dated
                            3<sup>rd</sup> December 2008 for [PGN’s] prompt
                        payment which is expected to be credit into [CRW’s] account not later
                        than 18<sup>th</sup> December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Second Dispute, as characterised by CRW,
                    was not only a different dispute, but was also one that had not been referred to
                    the DAB yet. As Prof Bunni observed, the losing party is in breach of contract
                    and the remedy for such a breach of contract is damages that might be imposed at
                    some future date. Given the opening words of sub-cl 20.6, the Second Dispute was
                    plainly outside the scope of sub-cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract. It
                    follows that the Majority Tribunal, and hence the Majority Award, exceeded the
                    scope of the Arbitration Agreement; the Majority Award is therefore liable to be
                    set aside under Article 34(2)(a)(iii). This outcome is the result of CRW’s
                    formulation of the Second Dispute and the approach taken by CRW in its reference
                    to arbitration under sub-cl 20.6 (<em>ie</em>, in
                    Arbitration Case No 16122).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Review of the DAB Decision under sub-cl 20.6 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The interim award in ICC Case No 10619
                    held that an arbitral tribunal could enforce by means of an interim or partial
                    award under ICC Rules, a binding but not final DAB decision by ordering the
                    losing party to pay immediately the amount stated in that DAB decision. ICC Case
                    No 10619 presupposes that a reference of this nature is admissible for
                    arbitration, and does not need to be referred to the DAB first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Even if, for the sake of argument, the Second
                    Dispute were referable to arbitration under sub-cl 20.6 without first being
                    referred to the DAB, one must remember that sub-cl 20.6 does not allow an
                    arbitral tribunal to make final a binding DAB decision without first hearing the
                    merits of that DAB decision. As a reminder, I have referred to the commentary in
                        <em>The New FIDIC Red Book</em> pointing out a
                    distinction between arbitration under sub-cl 20.6 (which requires a review of
                    the DAB decision on the merits) and arbitration under sub-cl 20.7 (which enables
                    enforcement of a DAB decision without considering the substantial dispute
                    between the parties) (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above).
                    Mr Mustain Sjadzali, the nominated representative of CRW, deposed at [22]
                    of his affidavit that CRW accepted the DAB Decision as “absolutely
                    correct” and, as such, CRW’s request for arbitration did not raise
                    “any issue as to whether the DAB Decision had been correctly made or
                    whether the arbitral tribunal ought to open, review and/or revise the DAB
                    Decision”. Mr Siraj Omar (counsel for CRW) also mentioned in his
                    submissions that if PGN were dissatisfied with the DAB Decision, it should be
                    the party to commence an arbitration to review the DAB Decision. The rebuttal to
                    this submission is that nothing in sub-cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract
                    presupposes that the party who filed the NOD must be the party to commence
                    arbitration. In reality, it is often the winning party who has the incentive or
                    initiative to commence arbitration to review the DAB decision in question with a
                    view to <em>confirming</em> that decision. In this way,
                    arbitration under sub cl 20.6 can start. Mr Mustain’s argument in the
                    context of sub-cl 20.6 is neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The essence of PGN’s defence to the
                    first issue referred to the Arbitral Tribunal on immediate payment of the sum
                    set out in the DAB Decision was, as I have noted, CRW’s non-adherence to
                    the arbitral procedure mandated in sub-cl 20.6, and PGN contended that there was
                    no express power granted to the Majority Tribunal to direct PGN to make
                    immediate payment of the sum set out in the DAB Decision without first obtaining
                    by way of arbitration, a review on the merits of the disputes covered by the DAB
                    Decision. The powers of the Arbitral Tribunal as spelt out in sub-cl 20.6, are,
                    and I repeat, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The arbitrator(s) shall have full power to open up, review and revise any
                        certificate, determination, instruction, opinion or valuation of the
                        Engineer, and any decision of the DAB, relevant to the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short, the Arbitral Tribunal must be asked by CRW to review the
                    correctness of the DAB Decision before it can make the DAB Decision
                    “final and binding”. In this regard, I make two points. First, it
                    is upon a reference by the winning party to review and confirm (rather than to
                    revise) the correctness of the decision of the DAB, and a claim for an interim
                    or provisional award based on the DAB decision pending resolution of the review
                    of the decision, that an arbitral tribunal may make an interim or provisional
                    award of indisputable amounts, leaving the remaining items to be adjudicated.
                    This point is consistent with the observations made in para 9.220 of
                        <em>FIDIC Contracts: Law and Practice</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The second point concerns the issuance of a
                    “final award” by the Majority Tribunal in the form of the Majority
                    Award, there being no outstanding issues on the merits to be determined (see
                        <em>Redfern and Hunter</em> at para 9.18). In the
                    circumstances of the present case, given CRW’s formulation of the Second
                    Dispute in the form of the first issue put to the Arbitral Tribunal (see
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), it is understandable why the
                    Majority Tribunal issued the Majority Award. An arbitral tribunal is bound by
                    the perimeters of the claims submitted to it and, thus, may not order interim
                    measures without the request of a party. However, that did not make the Majority
                    Award valid. Clause 20 of the Conditions of Contract did not allow for an
                    arbitral tribunal to make final a DAB decision without first hearing the merits
                    of that DAB decision. This was, as stated, the defence of PGN to the first issue
                    on immediate payment of the sum set out in the DAB Decision: PGN was seeking to
                    argue that the powers of the arbitrators expressly stipulated in sub-cl 20.6 did
                    not include the power to direct PGN to make immediate payment of the sum set out
                    in the DAB Decision without a review confirming the correctness of the DAB
                    Decision. In context, the Arbitral Tribunal’s powers under sub-cl 20.6 was
                    expressly to open up, review and revise the DAB Decision, which meant that an
                    adjudication on the Second Dispute without determining the correctness of the
                    DAB Decision would be tantamount to converting that binding but not final
                    decision into a final arbitration award and ignoring the provisions of the
                    Conditions of Contract concerning dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I am here reminded of the provisions of the
                    standard form in the Gold Book which are unlike the provisions in the present
                    case (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). If anything, the
                    tribunal in ICC Case No 10619 made an interim or provisional award by
                    giving effect to the governing law of the contract. The tribunal’s interim
                    award contained the following specific reservation of the parties’ rights
                    (ICC International Court of Arbitration Bulletin, Volume 19, No 2 –
                    2008, p 90 para 27):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rights of the parties as to the merits of their case, including but
                        not limited to the final and binding effect of the Engineer’s decision
                        are reserved until the final Award of this Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Majority Tribunal also made express reference in the Majority
                    Award that PGN is free to commence separate arbitration proceedings to review
                    the merits of the DAB Dispute. The problem here, however, is that the
                    reservation of PGN’s right to commence separate arbitration is unlike (and
                    will probably not have the same effect as) a reservation of rights to argue
                    before the same tribunal which made an interim award that the award is wrong and
                    that the corresponding amounts should be repaid to PGN. Furthermore, as a
                    preliminary observation, I note that there could <em>potentially</em> be issues of <em>res
                        judicata</em>. CRW had obtained an ex-parte order (in the form of the
                    Registration Order) to convert the Majority Award into a judgment (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) and if the judgment of US$17,298,834.57
                    is not set aside, questions of a merger of the cause of action into the judgment
                    and the associated problem of issue estoppel may arise. The long and short of
                    the matter is that the manner of CRW’s reference to arbitration ignored
                    the provisions of sub-cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract concerning dispute
                    resolution. The Majority Tribunal’s reservation of right is cold comfort
                    to PGN where the Majority Award has been converted into a judgment, there being
                    no specific provision in the Conditions of Contract to address the effect of
                    entry of judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Article 34(2)(iii) of Model Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To summarise, the real dispute was clearly
                    whether the DAB Decision was correct and following that, whether CRW was
                    entitled to the payment of the sum which the DAB had decided was due. However,
                    CRW tried to limit the dispute to only whether payment of that sum should be
                    made immediately and, in doing so, wrongly relied on sub-cl 20.6. In fact, there
                    is no express right of a party to refer to arbitration under sub-cl 20.7 a
                    failure of the other party to comply with a binding but not final decision of
                    the DAB. An arbitration commenced under sub-cl 20.6 requires a review of the
                    correctness of the DAB decision. First, CRW’s reference to arbitration
                    involved a “dispute” which was never referred to the DAB. Second,
                    the reference was not on the merits of the DAB Decision (unlike ICC Case
                    No 10619, where the issue regarding the immediate enforceability of the
                    Engineer’s decision was pursued as an interim or partial award under the
                    auspices of the arbitration on the merits of the Engineer’s decision).
                    Accordingly, the Majority Tribunal exceeded its powers by rendering a final
                    award pertaining to: (a) a dispute that was not referred first to the DAB,
                    bearing in mind that before a dispute can be subject to arbitration, it must
                    first have been referred to the DAB and the appropriate NOD must have been
                    served (see <em>The New FIDIC Red Book</em> at
                    para 20-046); and (b) a dispute that was not within the scope of the
                    Arbitration Agreement (similar to the factual scenario in <em>Tiong Huat Rubber</em>). Hence, the Majority Award was liable to be
                    and was indeed set aside under Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model
                Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Before moving to the next challenge, for
                    completeness, I now come to the question posed in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above on what the winning party can do, in the face of a
                    valid NOD, to enforce a binding but not final decision of the DAB when the other
                    party fails to give prompt effect to it as required by sub-cl 20.4 of the 1999
                    Red Book. Either party may submit the dispute covered by the DAB decision in
                    question to arbitration if a NOD has been served. The losing party can ask the
                    arbitral tribunal to review and revise the DAB Decision. Alternatively, the
                    winning party can ask the arbitral tribunal to review and confirm the DAB
                    decision. It can include a claim for an interim award <em>vis-a-vis</em> the DAB decision to be enforced, with the amount owed
                    as set out in the DAB decision to be paid pending accordingly. The amount paid
                    out is liable to be returned to the payer, depending on how the tribunal, after
                    reviewing DAB decision, decides the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2)   Majority Award not made in accordance with the
                agreed arbitral procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     PGN had also sought to set aside the Majority
                    Award on the further ground that it was not made in accordance with the agreed
                    arbitral procedure set out in Article 34(2)(a)(iv) of the Model Law, which
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Article 34. Application for setting aside as exclusive
                            recourse against arbitral award</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  An arbitral award may be set aside by the
                        court specified in Article 6 only if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)  the party making the application furnishes
                            proof that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(iv)  the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal or the
                                arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the
                                parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of
                                this Law from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such
                                agreement, was not in accordance with this Law;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This ground of challenge contemplates
                    situations where there are irregularities in the procedural rules agreed between
                    the parties. These procedural rules will include, for example, rules on the
                    timelines for submission of answers in response to the request for arbitration,
                    the information required to be provided in the submissions, notification to the
                    parties of the names of the members of the arbitral tribunal, <em>etc</em>. What PGN was concerned about was the substantial aspect of
                    the Arbitration Agreement, <em>not</em> the procedure. This
                    was actually another facet of the same complaint under Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of
                    the Model Law, <em>viz</em>, that the Majority Tribunal had
                    acted in excess of its power. I have already taken this argument into account
                    when considering Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3)   Alleged breach of the rules of natural
                justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Section 24(b) of the IAA states that the court
                    may set aside the arbitral award if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the
                        making of the award by which the rights of any party have been
                        prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Article 18 of the Model Law also provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Article 18. Equal treatment of
                        parties</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a
                        full opportunity of presenting his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">PGN argued that the Majority Tribunal’s decision to shut out
                    PGN’s arguments on the underlying merits amounted to a breach of the rules
                    of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The principles regarding the setting aside of
                    an arbitral award on the basis of a breach of the rules of natural justice were
                    extensively considered in <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v
                        Fairmont Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86
                        ("<em>Soh Beng Tee</em>"), and I shall not endeavor to
                    repeat them here. An allegation of a breach of the rules of natural justice is
                    serious and should not be taken lightly. Borrowing Justice Lax’s words in
                    the Canadian case of <em>Corporacion Transnacional de Inversiones
                        S.A. de C.V</em>. v. <em>STET International
                        S.p.A</em>., 1999 Carswell Ont.2988 at [33], to establish a breach of
                    the rules of natural justice under Article 18 of the Model Law, “the
                    conduct of the Tribunal must be sufficiently serious to offend our most basic
                    notions of justice and morality”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     PGN was not very clear in its allegations on
                    exactly which rule of natural justice was contravened. From its submission, PGN
                    seemed to be attacking the Majority Award on the basis that the Majority
                    Tribunal did not give it a proper hearing. However, as just mentioned, it was
                    not clear whether this was indeed PGN’s submission. Such a vague
                    allegation was tantamount to PGN taking a shot in the dark, and must be
                    discouraged. On the facts of this case, to say that the Majority Tribunal had,
                    in PGN’s words, “shut out” PGN was a rather extreme and
                    perhaps, unfair criticism to make of the Majority Tribunal. Although the
                    Majority Tribunal ultimately decided that PGN was not entitled to open up,
                    review and revise the DAB Decision in Arbitration Case No 16122, the
                    Majority Tribunal’s decision, whether right or wrong, was not relevant as
                    to whether there was a breach of the rule of the right to be heard. PGN had
                    indeed been heard for the purposes of determining the issues that were put
                    before this arbitration. PGN was never denied an opportunity to present or argue
                    its case on why it should be entitled to open up, review and revise the DAB
                    Decision. In fact, I noted that there was one occasion where the Arbitral
                    Tribunal invited counsel for PGN to address the point as to the amount of the
                    claim which PGN thought it should be ordered to pay; however PGN’s counsel
                    was not prepared to address that issue then since sub-cl 20.6 was raised as a
                    defence. PGN took the position that it would prefer to leave the final sum to be
                    determined by the Arbitral Tribunal with the help of an auditor. In the
                    circumstances, I did not accept PGN’s contention that the Majority
                    Tribunal had breached the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons stated, the Majority Tribunal
                    had acted in excess of its powers given under the Arbitration Agreement. The
                    application to set aside the Majority Award was therefore allowed with the costs
                    of the proceedings to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
