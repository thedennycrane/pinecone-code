Nevertheless, it is unclear, having regard to the spirit of pleadings, that Shantanu has sufficiently informed REG that he intends to rely on approbation and reprobation and of waiver by election by mere reference to “abuse of process” in his Defence, as it is not necessarily the case that the doctrines are exactly the same. REG’s witnesses have not prepared their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) to respond to Shantanu relying on approbation and reprobation and waiver by election, and Shantanu has also not attested to state that REG has taken inconsistent positions in the Suit and Arbitration.

There is no inconsistency between specific performance or damages for breach of the SPA being sought on one hand, and damages for misrepresentation on the other.

The focus of the averment is thus <span class="font-italic">Educomp’s</span> conduct in relation to JRRES, even assuming that Shantanu is its directing mind. Pertinently, para 33(c) of the SOC pleads <span class="font-italic">Shantanu</span>’s conduct as limited to failing to cause JRRES to obtain requisite approvals pursuant to JRRES’s obligations under the JRRES SPA, which is not what REG is relying on for the JRRES Inducement Claim; rather REG is relying on Shantanu’s conduct as causing JRRES to refuse to refund the Advance Sale Consideration which is not pleaded (see also [280]–[281] below).

Shantanu agreed that during the Mar 2015 Meetings, Ashish and Jyostna would liaise with him on changes to be made to the draft SPA, and Ashish regularly updated Shantanu over the phone on the negotiations at those meetings. This comports with Dennis’ testimony that Ashish attended the Mar 2015 Meetings on Shantanu’s behalf in Shantanu’s capacity as director of E-AP and in whatever role Shantanu had in Edulearn.

Second, he chose not to procure the resignations of the Annex D Persons. Third, he authorised Educomp to make repeated non-genuine requests for extension of the Closing Date. Fourth, he unreasonably caused the Sellers to decline the Proposal. Overarching these acts was Shantanu’s desire to obtain personal gratification from the SPA.

Hence, the Sellers could not be relieved of the burden of funding JRRES indefinitely whilst continuing to retain control of JRRES. Such control was in any event (until the resignations of the Annex D Persons) jointly exercised by Chew as Chairman and Shantanu as President.

E-Solutions had started corporate debt restructuring in July 2013. The evidence on whole shows that Educomp entered into the SPA because it wanted to sell its stake in the JV Entities as it was unable to further contribute funds to the JV. Indeed, as will subsequently be seen: (a) Shantanu was keen to execute the SPA because he intended to enrich himself from the SPA Consideration (if and when Closing occurred); and (b) he formed the intention to frustrate Closing only after the SPA was executed because of events that transpired thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the round, I find REG has not made out its claim for fraudulent misrepresentation against Shantanu.

The BAA party was changed to Edulearn when Dennis replied to Jyotsna on 9 March 2015 (copied to Shantanu and Ashish) with a revised draft (“Party Amendment”). This change was based on Shantanu’s instructions, and Doris also attested that Ashish told her that Shantanu wanted the BAA Consideration to be made to Edulearn instead.

I find that Ashish and Dennis made the BAA Reps in response to the assurances sought by REG. With the Party Amendment, REI would contract with an unfamiliar entity and thus it asked for a COI of Edulearn which was a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) entity. When Ashish told Doris on 10 March 2015 that a COI could only be provided after five working days, she requested for a solicitor’s undertaking confirming that Shantanu was then a director of Edulearn and that the COI would be delivered shortly after the execution of the BAA. Dennis then provided the 12/3/15 Undertaking (see [24] above). After the signing of the SPA, he provided a COI dated 17 March 2015 (“17/3/15 COI”) that reflected Shantanu as a director of Edulearn from 10 February 2015.

Hence the BAA stated that Edulearn would provide its services through its board of directors which “shall” include Shantanu. It is undisputed that REG wanted to retain Shantanu given his knowledge and experience in the Indian education business and his connections in India, as Chew and Ashish attested. In court, John explained that REG was “very concerned” as Shantanu would render the advisory services and yet Shantanu proposed the contracting entity be changed to a company.

</div> It was against this backdrop that Dennis provided the 12/3/15 Undertaking.

Dennis did not dispute this or that the Payee Amendment was an important matter discussed at the Mar 2015 Meetings.

The BAA and SPA were intertwined. REG wanted to continue tapping on Shantanu’s expertise and experience in the Indian education business once Educomp exited the JV, for which expertise it would pay. It was thus important for REG to ensure Closing would take place given its already substantial investment in the JV Entities. As Doris attested, the assurance that Edulearn would refund the BAA Initial Payment if Closing did not materialise due to Educomp’s default was important to REG. Otherwise there was no reason to make payment under the BAA if the SPA did not complete, as Educomp would still be part of the JV and Shantanu (being E-Solutions’ Chairman and MD) would have to continue to act in the JV’s interest without REG having to separately pay for his services.

</div> Indeed, I find Shantanu was the beneficial owner of Soumya’s shares in Edulearn.

Ashish agreed he could not have done so unless Shantanu had an interest in Edulearn. Tellingly, Ashish described Edulearn as “one of the Educomp companies”. His explanation in court, that this was because Shantanu <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> became a director in Edulearn when he was also the MD for E-Solutions, was unconvincing. That Shantanu had a real interest in Edulearn is also supported by Sunil’s email to Ashish on 12 March 2015 referring to Edulearn as “Shantanu’s advisory firm”, which Ashish did not correct.

Again, Shantanu’s claim that this was done on Soumya’s instructions was unbelievable and also unsubstantiated. By this time, Soumya was no longer a shareholder or director of Edulearn.

</div> As for the purported unresolved issues, this was unsubstantiated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Hence, Shantanu knew the BAA Initial Payment had to be refunded to REI but chose to put the moneys beyond its reach. As Dennis stated, the source of the transfer of US$102,019.15 to Lienka was the BAA Initial Payment (see [134(h)] above). Whilst Shantanu’s failure to refund the BAA Initial Payment could be argued to merely evidence an intention to induce Edulearn to breach cl 3.2.5.1 of the BAA only after the BAA had been entered into, the body of evidence – in particular the Payee and Payment Amendments and (as I will explain later) Shantanu’s desire to personally profit from the SPA – points to the stronger inference that Shantanu never intended to refund moneys should Closing fail to materialise, and made the BAA Reps fraudulently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For completeness, there is no inconsistency in Shantanu originally intending for Closing to occur and yet intending to retain the BAA Initial Payment should Closing not materialise. Whilst he stood to personally gain more moneys if Closing took place (see [187] below), he would also benefit from the BAA Initial Payment even if it did not. It must be remembered the BAA came to be as Shantanu <span class="font-italic">wanted to receive some moneys personally</span> in connection with the sale of Educomp’s stake in the JV. This led to the structuring of the BAA which first named Shantanu as a party before the Party Amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As for Dennis, I find he also made the BAA Reps fraudulently. The matters I relied on to show that Shantanu was fraudulent would equally show Dennis had no intention to comply with cl 3.2.5.1 of the BAA. These included the Party and Payee Amendments (which Dennis negotiated on Edulearn’s behalf) and the flow of the BAA Initial Payment from the ANZ Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In particular, Dennis claimed he did not receive the 8/5/17 Demand Letter at the material time (which I disbelieve) as it was sent to the AXA Address (being TKQ Partnership’s address) but he had left TKQ Partnership’s employ on 31 December 2016.

</div> This suggests that Dennis had received a few hundred thousand dollars (in financial year 2013) for simply being, as he claimed, a nominee director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Dennis denied having received such a large remuneration in relation to Wizlearn and claimed that the amounts he received were all recorded in invoices which he had disclosed to the court. I disbelieve him. He merely disclosed some invoices to show that in 2009 and 2012 he had billed Wizlearn $2,800 per month for acting as a nominee director.

</div> However, he did not disclose any invoices for the financial years ending 2013 and 2014. I disbelieve he had either forgotten or did not have copies of other invoices pertaining to Wizlearn, particularly the later invoices (of 2013), when he could disclose invoices for earlier years of 2009 and 2012. I infer that he deliberately chose not to do so as those invoices would not support his claim. This is consistent with Dennis’ conduct, where he admitted to not disclosing the 3/10/14 and 13/3/15 COIs because they would have shown the Directorship Representation to be false.

</div> Dennis attempted to explain away the large sum by claiming that it was the total amount he received from October 2013 to March 2017 and he had also “made a great contribution” to this company. He explanation is not only unconvincing and unsubstantiated, but the evidence also showed otherwise. Edulearn SG was a holding company with no business. Moreover, its financial statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2017 showed the “director’s fee” of $107,000 was paid only for that financial year, with no sum having been paid in the previous financial year. Shantanu also accepted that Dennis was paid $107,000 in that financial year alone.

This rendered the BAA Reps substantially false. The Party and Payee Amendments were introduced rather late in the negotiations and engendered risks that REI would be unable to recover the BAA Initial Payment. I have also found that REG sought assurances from Ashish and Dennis that Edulearn would abide by the BAA terms because of these amendments. Hence, it is also clear that REI acted on the BAA Reps in entering into the BAA. As such, REG has succeeded on its claim of fraudulent misrepresentation on the BAA Reps against the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim against defendants for negligent misrepresentation  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 REG pleaded that alternatively the defendants are liable for negligent misrepresentation for making the SPA and BAA Reps. It is unnecessary for me to consider this issue in relation to the BAA Reps as I have found REG has proven its case in fraudulent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As for the SPA Reps, I find REG failed to prove its claim in negligent misrepresentation. I have found that the SPA Reps attributable to Shantanu were not false at any point before the SPA was entered into and REG has not shown that Dennis made these representations. Furthermore, cl 16.1 of the SPA specifically excludes liability for negligent representation. This clause provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement … set out the entire agreement between the Parties in respect of the sale and purchase of the Sale Shares … None of the Parties has entered into this Agreement in reliance on any representation, warranty or undertaking which is not expressly contained in this Agreement. This clause 16 shall not exclude liability for (or remedy in respect of) fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I am of the view that the defendants can rely on this clause. The plain language of cl 16.1 coupled with the fact that the parties to the SPA are corporate entities whose representations must necessarily be made by individuals representing them, support that the Purchasers and Sellers intended for cl 16 to extend to representations made by their agents or representatives. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim against defendants for inducing breach of contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 I now consider REG’s claim that the defendants induced the Sellers and Edulearn to breach the SPA and BAA respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 To establish the tort of inducing breach of contract, a plaintiff must establish that the alleged tortfeasor knew of the existence of the contract, intended to interfere with the plaintiff’s contractual rights and directly procured or induced a third party to breach the contract. He must also show that the contract was in fact breached and he suffered injury as a result of the breach (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club</span>”) at [311]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I deal first with the defendants’ reliance on the principle in <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt</span> which provides that a director would ordinarily be immune from tortious liability for authorising or procuring his company’s breach of contract if he was acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> within the scope of his authority. The director can rely on the immunity unless his decision (to authorise or procure his company’s breach) is made in breach of his personal legal duties to the company. The principle operates as a requirement of liability. The focus of the inquiry is on the director’s conduct and intention pertaining to his duties to his company, and not towards the third party (<span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala Arthaputra and others v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 1 SLR 818 at [65]–[66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The defendants’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt</span> does not add much to the inquiry. In relation to the SPA, Dennis was never a director of E-Prof and Shantanu had ceased to be a director by 2013. Even if he was E-Prof’s director at the time the SPA was executed, it is unclear if he was one at the time of the acts which REG founds its claim for inducement of breach of contract. Whilst the defendants were directors of E-AP at the material time,

</div> I was not persuaded that Shantanu wished for Educomp to be relieved of its burden of funding JRRES whilst retaining control of it (see [101] above). But if the defendants had induced the Sellers to breach the SPA to put pressure on REG to pay moneys to either of them, they would have clearly acted in breach of their director’s duties to E-AP. They would have attempted to either enrich themselves at E-AP’s expense or deprived E-AP of receiving the SPA Consideration. As such, they would have acted dishonestly, for improper purposes, and contrary to E-AP’s best interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Similarly, if the defendants induced a breach of the BAA to personally benefit from the BAA Initial Payment,

</div> Her claim that she did not know if the document she received was correct (thus implying she would be careful before forwarding it to Intertrust) was inconsistent with her testimony that she would <span class="font-italic">not </span>check the Closing Documents before forwarding them onwards, and showed up her lack of credibility.

In court, she claimed this was because “there were so many versions of documents going around”. Jyotsna’s explanation was unconvincing. She knew the Cl 4.1 Docs should have been submitted by 5 July 2015, and Ashish agreed that even if the Sellers were to deliver the documents personally, this had to be done by the deadlines in the SPA. Tellingly, Jyotsna admitted she was acting under Ashish’s instructions in raising the “safety reasons” for delivering documents personally.

</div> Despite John then providing Jyotsna with the MGT-4 forms, Jyotsna did not complete nor send the forms to Intertrust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Jyotsna’s cavalier attitude towards dealing with Closing matters such as submitting incomplete or wrong documents and claiming not to verify before forwarding the documents to Intertrust was telling. She even claimed that it was in cross-examination that she first realised she had forwarded the wrong cl 4.1.3 documents! This did not sit well with her claim (in court) that she took her task “very seriously”.

</div> Yet at the same time, she insisted on delivering the Cl 4.1 Docs personally for safety reasons. Her strange behaviour showed her to have been acting deliberately to frustrate Closing. There was no reason why the Cl 4.1 Docs could not be procured by the Sellers, who had more than three months to do so. Ashish accepted that the Sellers would have had no difficulties obtaining them as they were “very innocuous” and “very simple” documents and many of these documents were within Educomp’s possession or control.

Ashish then asked John to explain what he meant by “drastic change” and said the Sellers would physically submit the original documents on 11 August for Closing to occur on 13 August 2015.

However, Dennis made the Counter-Proposal instead to extend Closing by four more months without explaining why the Sellers needed so much time and what “practical restraints” or “practical difficulties” they were facing. If the “practical difficulties” were rooted in Shantanu’s purported difficulties in getting Harpreet and Soumya to resign from JRRES, I had earlier found they did not exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I reject Ashish’s claim that he did not instruct Dennis to ask for a four-month extension.

The obligation to obtain the resignations of the Annex D Persons was already a condition precedent to Closing and the 10% of the SPA Consideration was meant to compensate the Purchasers where Closing took place with REG only obtaining a majority as opposed to total control of JRRES.

Chew attested that shortly after the announcement, Shantanu asked him why REC made the announcement which was a breach of the confidentiality clause, to which Chew replied that REC was obliged under the SGX listing rules to make disclosure of the SPA and cl 11 permitted disclosure where it was required “by law or regulation”.

</div> In any event, there is nothing to suggest the Purchasers acquiring control of JRRES was illegal or improper. Jyotsna had satisfied herself, in consultation with external Indian lawyers, that the Term Sheets (leading to the SPA) were proper under Indian law.  Indeed, Shantanu never raised a similar objection when Rohit’s Email (see [64] above) set out the proposal for REG and Educomp (for-profit entities) to jointly obtain control of JRRES or when the parties initially sought to sell their entire stake in JRRES to the Times of India Group (also a for-profit entity).

He then acted to frustrate Closing to pressure REG to accede to the requests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Shantanu’s motivation as described is supported by the disparity between the SPA Consideration and the true value of ERHEL’s shares. Shantanu agreed the shares were, at the time the SPA was signed, valued at about 10 crores (or INR100m).

</div> Although the SPA also encompassed the transfer of control of JRRES, the SPA Consideration (of INR 986.4m) was expressed to be payment for the Sellers’ shares. Thus, on its face, the Purchasers were overpaying for the Sellers’ stake in ERHEL. As Shantanu admitted, it was “clearly overvalued”, this caused him to be in “a bit of a sticky wicket” vis-à-vis Harpreet, and the deal for the Sellers was “too good to be true and people [were] going to question it”.

Dennis’ inaction in the face of John’s two emails was probative of him having intentionally provided the wrong document required under cl 4.1.3 of the SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Next, instead of getting the Sellers to comply with the SPA after receiving the 2/9/15 Purchaser’s Notice, Dennis participated in them issuing the Termination Notice dated 25 September 2015, which was emailed to Doris by Jyotsna (“Jyotsna’s 25/9/15 Email”). I disbelieve Dennis was not involved in drafting the notice and that it was Darshan &amp; Teo LLP (“Darshan LLP”), whom Jyotsna had copied on her email enclosing the notice, who had done so. Ashish claimed the Sellers had engaged Darshan LLP to defend the Purchasers’ request for Emergency Interim Relief made to the SIAC.

Dennis admitted he saw the Termination Notice at the material time. He agreed the confidentiality clause did not prevent REC from making such announcement as required by law and the Sellers’ obligations under cl 4 of the SPA were mandatory.

He thus failed to act in E-AP’s best interests. He had deprived E-AP of receiving about $21m from the SPA, which he accepted was important to E-AP. By failing to close the SPA, E-AP was obliged under cl 3.1.2 of the SPA to equalise the Purchasers’ contribution to JRRES for its operations. Vis-à-vis E-AP, Dennis cannot rely on <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt</span> to deny liability. In this regard, I accept Dennis held his directorship in E-AP as Shantanu’s nominee. Both Dennis and Shantanu had attested as such (see [46] above).

The defendants knew Edulearn had breached cl 3.2.5.1 of the BAA by failing to refund the BAA Initial Payment to REI following receipt of the 8/5/17 Demand Letter.

However, contrary to Shantanu’s claim, I have found that he was a shareholder and a key decision-maker in Edulearn at the material time, and that Soumya was his nominee director (see [121]–[128] above). The 17/3/15 and 7/11/19 COIs showed Shantanu to be a director of Edulearn at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Moreover, Shantanu’s claim that he could not induce Edulearn’s breach of the BAA is contradicted by the evidence. Dennis attested he followed Shantanu’s instructions to transfer the money from the ANZ Account on 2 April 2015 and 12 June 2017, and from his personal account to Lienka on 3 December 2019 which he stated was Edulearn’s money (see [134] above). Shantanu conceded that he instructed Dennis to transfer $139,351.29 from the ANZ Account to Dennis’ account but claimed that it was to hold on trust for Edulearn based on Soumya’s instructions.

These acts (“the Acts”) included: (a) interfering with and disrupting the operation and management of JRRES; (b) causing JRRES to default on its obligations under the JRRES SPA; (c) unilaterally suspending key employees of Noida College without basis; (d) refusing to cooperate in approving payments to vendors and staff of Noida College; (e) deliberately withholding the approval of corporate compliance processes in India in relation to ERHEL and MIDL; and (f) improperly taking possession of documents belonging to the JV Entities. REG claims the defendants did so to pressure the Purchasers to withdraw the Arbitration, leave the JV or to accede to Shantanu’s request to be paid the SPA Consideration directly.

On the assumption that the Acts occurred (and which I make no finding at this point), there is insufficient evidence to link Dennis to them. REG acknowledged that Dennis “does not appear to have been directly involved in the various wrongful acts vis-à-vis the JV [E]ntities”. They, however, attempt to tie Dennis to the JV Conspiracy by suggesting the Acts were only made possible because of his role in preventing Closing (and particularly because he refused to submit the Closing Documents or allowed E-AP to vigorously contest the Arbitration).

REG has not substantiated its claim that Dennis had caused or permitted E-AP to vigorously contest the Arbitration. I reiterate that REG did not challenge Shantanu’s evidence that Dennis was not involved in the Arbitration. But even if Dennis had been involved in the Arbitration and, as I have found, induced the Sellers’ breach of the SPA by submitting the 5/7/13 E-AP Resolution instead of the Cl 4.1.3 Resolution, these do not prove his involvement (whether direct or indirect) in the Acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 On the contrary, the evidence points to Dennis being uninvolved in the Acts, which were events based in India and largely concern Indian entities. Dennis had, however, dealt with matters whilst in Singapore, and dealt with foreign entities only when he had some link to them. Thus, he was responsible for obtaining the 17/3/15 COI because of his role in Edulearn and for procuring the Cl 4.1.3 Resolution as he was E-AP’s director. None of the witnesses testified to Dennis’ involvement in the Acts. Hence, the mere fact that Dennis had induced the Sellers’ breach of the SPA is insufficient to show that he participated in the JV Conspiracy, even if his actions had prevented Closing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 The absence of an agreement between the defendants to perform the Acts would also mean that REG’s claim in lawful means conspiracy pertaining to the JV Conspiracy likewise fails.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim against Shantanu for inducing breach of the JVA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 Next, REG claims Shantanu is liable for inducing E-Solutions to breach the JVA because E-Solutions had breached various implied terms (the “Terms”) given Educomp’s failure to close the SPA and the disruptive acts its representatives undertook vis-à-vis the JV Entities (and Noida College) to seriously harm and destroy these entities. REG pleads and claims the Terms as follows: that REC and E-Solutions would act in ways which respect the spirit and objectives of the JVA (including in the interest of the JV and its entities), act in good faith, and not conduct itself in such a way that increases the other party’s liabilities with respect to the JV and its entities.

REG submits that the JV parties would have readily agreed to the Terms if they had been put to the parties at the time of contract formation.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 I do not find that there is a gap in the JVA such that it is necessary to imply the Terms. I find the JVA has, as far as the JVA parties intended, provided for the duties the parties owe each other. A perusal of the JVA shows the parties had contemplated and provided for specific circumstances in which they had to act in “good faith” or “mutual co-operation”. Clause 17.8 stipulated that the parties were “to do all things as may be reasonably required to give effect to [the JVA] according to its spirit and intent”. Obligations of good faith and/or mutual co-operation were also provided for under cll 10.5 (to endeavour to achieve the listing of the shares of the relevant Special Purpose Vehicles), 12.2, 12.4.1, 12.12 (where the JVA is terminated by mutual agreement) and 15.1 (to resolve disputes relating to the JVA). Hence, this was not a case in which the JVA parties never thought about good faith obligations or the need to conduct themselves in respect of the spirit or objectives of the JVA. That the parties had contemplated and provided for obligations similar to the Terms in specific circumstances would lead to the inference that they did not intend to provide for other obligations in the form of the Terms. In this regard, I also do not accept that the JVA should include the Term that a party is not to conduct itself in such a way as to increase the other party’s liabilities with respect to the JV entities. To me, it is unclear what the ambit of this term (as proposed by REG) is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 It must be remembered that the parties to the JVA are highly sophisticated commercial entities (and represented by lawyers) and the JVA is a comprehensive document. Ultimately, the threshold for implying a term is a high one and a term will only be implied if necessary. The court will not rewrite the contract for the parties based on its own sense of what is fair and just (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> at [88] and [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 In any event, I find REG has failed to show, on balance, that Shantanu had induced E-Solutions to breach the JVA by breaching any such Terms. Even if Shantanu had induced <span class="font-italic">E-AP and E-Prof</span> to breach the <span class="font-italic">SPA</span> by frustrating or preventing Closing, this does not equate to Shantanu having induced <span class="font-italic">E-Solutions</span> to breach the <span class="font-italic">JVA</span>. As for the disruptive acts pertaining to the JV Entities and Noida College after E-AP and E-Prof’s failure to close the SPA, it is unclear how Shantanu had induced E-Solutions to breach the JVA by reason of such acts (assuming they occurred and were unlawful). Noida College was established and managed by JRRES, a society. Any acts that Shantanu caused pertaining to Noida College would have been done by reason of his capacity and position in JRRES and it is unclear how such acts could be attributed to E-Solutions. The same reasoning applies in relation to ERHEL and MIDL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 As such, REG’s claim against Shantanu for inducing E-Solutions to breach the JVA is not made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim against Shantanu for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Finally, I consider REG’s claim that in Educomp committing various acts vis-à-vis the JV Entities and Noida College, Shantanu is liable to REG for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means (“Unlawful Means Tort”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Elements of the tort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 To establish the Unlawful Means Tort, the claimant must show: (a) the defendant committed an unlawful act affecting a third party; (b) the defendant acted with an intention to injure the claimant; and (c) the defendant’s conduct in fact resulted in damage to the claimant (<span class="font-italic">Paragon Shipping Pte Ltd v Freight Connect (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 574 (“<span class="font-italic">Paragon Shipping</span>”) at [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 What amounts to “unlawful means” has not been settled in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">OBG Ltd v Allan</span> [2008] 1 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">OBG</span>”), Lord Hoffmann (for the majority) held that in a three-party setting – namely, where a third party is the victim of the defendant’s unlawful act – acts against the third party count as unlawful means only if they are actionable by that third party, or if the only reason why they are not actionable is because the third party has suffered no loss. Unlawful means, however, do not include acts which may be unlawful against a third party but do not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant, or criminal acts not actionable in private law (at [49], [51], [57], [59]). Lord Nicholls preferred a wider approach in that “unlawful means” embraced “all acts a defendant is not permitted to do, whether by the civil law or the criminal law”, subject to the qualification that liability should be found only where the claimant is harmed through the “instrumentality” of a third party (at [159], [162]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 In Singapore, the court’s analysis on this tort has hitherto been resolved on the basis of inadequate pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">Wolero</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lim Arvin Sylvester </span>[2017] 4 SLR 747 at [65]) or the plaintiffs’ failure to prove any form of impropriety in the acts complained of or to prove the defendants committed the relevant acts with the intent of injuring the plaintiffs (see <span class="font-italic">Paragon Shipping</span> at [84]; <span class="font-italic">Leiman, Ricardo and another v Noble Resources Ltd and another</span> [2018] SGHC 166 at [270]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 That said, the divergence in views in <span class="font-italic">OBG</span> is not material to the present case, as will be seen later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the SPA automatically terminated on 2 September 2015</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 I deal first with Shantanu’s claim that he believed that by around 2 September 2015 the SPA had automatically terminated under cl 5.9 (as Closing failed to materialise) such that management of JRRES and Noida College revested jointly in REG and Educomp.

</div> Moreover, in February 2016, a Selection Committee whose members included an AKTU nominee resolved that Sharma possessed the necessary qualifications to be appointed Director of Noida College and ratified his appointment from 21 September 2015. Shantanu disputed the legitimacy of the Selection Committee, claiming that it was inquorate because it did not include the Chairman of the Governing Body and neither he nor Chew sat on the committee. But Chew (Chairman of the Governing Body) was on the committee, and Shantanu could not proffer a satisfactory answer when this was pointed out to him in court.

Finally, there was no good reason for Shantanu to withhold approval of payment of Sharma’s salary. It is not disputed that JRRES did not pay Sharma’s salary from the time of his appointment.

In fact, E-Solutions’ own Annual Report 2012/2013 had reflected JRRES as part of E-Solutions’ higher education initiative at the material time.

First, affidavits by the President and Secretary of JRRES (Shantanu and Harpreet respectively) verifying Noida College’s readiness to enrol students.

Yet he did not register his purported objections to the 5/9/15 Meeting with Manoj by replying to Manoj’s 13/10/15 Email or Manoj’s email of the next day stating that he (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Manoj) would be processing certain compliance matters for ERHEL and MIDL. Nor did Ashish raise this issue with Doris until 27 October 2015.

I infer that Ashish instructed Yogesh to obtain the 5/9/15 Meeting minutes from Manoj. Manoj wrote in his email to Yogesh that these minutes were “[a]s desired”, Yogesh held no role in ERHEL, and it was Ashish who connected Manoj with Yogesh.

</div> First, this claim was unsubstantiated. Second, on 28 December 2015, Shantanu had simply directed Manoj to convene a board meeting of ERHEL for the purposes of appointing directors, adopting accounts and reviewing the internal audit report, which was substantially similar to what Doris had earlier proposed,

</div> The general rule is that damages should be assessed as at the date of breach (<span class="font-italic">Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</span> [1976] 1 AC 443 at 468). Whilst the courts retain a residual discretion to assess damages at such other date as may be appropriate, I see no reason to depart from the general rule. Although REI has now obtained ERHEL’s shares held by E-AP, this was only because E-AP was wound up by the court (pursuant to an application filed by the Purchasers). Further, there remains E-Prof’s shares in ERHEL (even if comprising only 0.65% of all ERHEL’s shares) of which there is no evidence that they have been transferred to REI/RDI. Pertinently, the ceding of control of JRRES to REI/RDI <span class="font-italic">via</span> the resignations of the Annex D Persons aligned with Shantanu was a crucial part of the SPA, and this remains unperformed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 Mr Padman’s submission that REG is not entitled to recover the Arbitration Damages from Dennis because it “has not shown how the fact that the [Arbitration Damages] remain[s] unpaid is itself loss and damage occasioned by Dennis” misses the point.
