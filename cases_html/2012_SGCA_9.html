        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       A High Court Judge ("the Judge") approved the
                    Respondent’s scheme of arrangement (“the Scheme”) pursuant
                    to s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”) notwithstanding vigorous objections made by a number of creditors,
                    including the two appellants (see <em>Re TT International
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 177 (“the Judgment”)
                        at [2]). After considering the
                    submissions made to us, we allowed the appeals and ordered that new
                    creditors’ meetings (“the Further Meetings”) be called
                    within four weeks for the Scheme to be put to a re-vote, subject to certain
                    directions. These directions are stated in Annexure I. We should also
                    explain that the issuance of these detailed grounds for our decision has been
                    deferred until the resolution of a number of consequential issues arising from
                    our directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Schemes of arrangement are a useful democratic
                    process following which the claims of creditors asserting their ordinary legal
                    rights against a company in financial straits may be compromised or varied. They
                    sanction a process that restrains a minority from frustrating the will of a
                    majority of creditors to implement a beneficial scheme for a distressed company.
                    The objective of such schemes is to empower creditors to devise a composition
                    with the company that will, on the whole, be more beneficial than the likely
                    default alternative: liquidation. While the law allows the rights of a majority
                    in number representing 75% in value of the creditors at a scheme
                    creditors’ meeting (or meetings, if there is more than one class of
                    creditors) to prevail over the objections of dissentients, it is also equally
                    important that the rights of the minority are not illegitimately trampled over.
                    The convening of a separate meeting for each disparate class of creditors, in
                    particular, is a means of protecting a minority with different rights from the
                    possibly oppressive conduct of the majority. Schemes of arrangement now appear
                    to be the locally preferred mode of resuscitating salvageable businesses in
                    parlous financial circumstances. For this reason, it is crucial that there be
                    clarity in how such schemes are to be properly implemented and monitored in a
                    practical way in the common interest of the creditors and the company. These
                    grounds of decision emphasise the importance of scrupulous adherence to the
                    integrity of the processes by all involved in the oversight of such
                    schemes.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In Civil Appeal No 44 of 2010
                    (“CA 44”), the fourth appellant (the remaining appellants
                    withdrew before the hearing), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
                    (“OCBC”) took issue with the propriety of several aspects of the
                    Scheme. OCBC was one of the respondent’s creditors and had an admitted
                    claim of $21.66m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It had

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In Civil Appeal No 47 of 2010
                    (“CA 47”), the appellant was Ho Lee Construction Pte Ltd
                    (“Ho Lee”). Ho Lee was the respondent’s main contractor for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondent in both appeals was
                    TT International Limited (“the Respondent”). The Respondent
                    was incorporated locally in October 1984 as a private limited
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It was listed on the Main Board of
                    the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited under its present name,
                    TT International Limited, in June 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent is primarily in the business of trading and distributing consumer
                    electronic products under the brand name of AKIRA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    Accordingly, the main value of its business is in its trade receivables,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent is the main distributor and

                    presence through its subsidiaries (collectively referred together with the
                    Respondent as “the Group”) in Australia, South Africa, Poland,
                    France, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria, among other countries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the proposal of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Group’s main business activities
                    required high liquidity and it was heavily reliant on credit
                        facilities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Unsurprisingly, the global
                    credit crunch which followed the American subprime mortgage crisis in 2008
                    significantly affected the Group’s business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> As
                    of 31 October 2008, $66m out of $332m of the Respondent’s bank
                    facilities and $17m out of $117m of the Respondent’s subsidiaries’
                    bank facilities had been cancelled, withdrawn, reduced and/or frozen by their
                    lender banks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> This severely impacted the
                    Group’s existing working-capital, seriously disrupted its businesses and
                    operations and had an immediate knock on effect on the Respondent’s
                        operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Unable to obtain new credit facilities, the
                    Respondent faced severe cash flow problems which in turn made it difficult for
                    it to service its borrowings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> As
                    a result, some bank creditors declared default events in respect of their
                    facility agreements with the Respondent, recalled their facilities and demanded
                    prompt repayment of the sums due.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The
                    financial pressure on the Respondent was further compounded when some of its
                    trade and other creditors threatened to or commenced legal proceedings against
                    the Respondent to recover the moneys owed to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 31 October 2008, the Respondent moved to
                    improve its financial situation. It announced the appointment of nTan Corporate
                    Advisory Pte Ltd (“nTan”) as an independent financial advisor to
                    the Group and the appointment of WongPartnership LLP
                    (“WongP”) as its legal advisor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    Subsequent to an informal creditors’ meeting held that same day, the
                    Respondent announced that pending some consensual restructuring of its
                    operational activities and financial arrangements, it would implement an
                    immediate standstill of repayment of amounts owing to the bank creditors and all
                    other unsecured creditors, except for operationally essential trade
                        creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 4 December 2008,
                    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) was appointed by the Respondent
                    as the independent Special Accountant to the Group’s bank creditors, to
                    advise them on the restructuring of the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 29 January 2009, the Respondent
                    applied for and received approval from the court pursuant to s 210(1) of
                    the Act to summon a meeting of its creditors to propose a scheme of
                        arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> That meeting was to be held by

                    applied for and was granted an extension of time to call the meeting by
                    21 October 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Further, the Respondent also obtained a court
                    order restraining the commencement or continuation of proceedings against the
                    Respondent pending the approval by the court of the proposed scheme of
                        arrangement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Consequently, a winding up application which Ho

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Meanwhile, the key terms of the proposed
                    scheme were the subject of a number of discussions and meetings between the
                    Respondent, nTan, PwC and the Respondent’s bank creditors between November
                    2008 and September 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Despite the discussions, no consensus could be
                        reached.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Finally, in September 2009, the Respondent
                    decided to propose the Scheme for voting by creditors despite not having secured
                    the support of all its major creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Salient features of the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The proposed Scheme had three main features.
                    First, the Respondent was empowered to employ the Reverse Dutch Auction
                    (“RDA”) process to settle its debts with creditors who wanted
                    early compromises. Creditors coming under the Scheme (“Scheme
                    Creditors”) who were willing to accept a minimum discount of 80% on the
                    repayment of their debts would have their debts retired on a priority basis
                    under the RDA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The Respondent was to set
                    aside $30m for the RDA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Scheme

                    informed that the voting results would be announced only after 5.00pm on that

                    after 5.00pm, there was an unexpected change in the procedure as initially
                    notified to them. The Scheme Creditors were abruptly informed that the final
                    outcome of the voting could only be determined and announced after the proposed

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 26 October 2009, the Respondent

                    in favour of the Scheme before the court could sanction the Scheme. Apparently,
                    the Scheme only barely met the statutory threshold. It had been approved by just
                    a majority of Scheme Creditors representing 75.06% in value, exceeding the
                    statutory threshold by a razor thin margin. The Scheme would not have passed
                    muster if the supporting Scheme Creditors’ claims were reduced by $1.3m or
                    if an additional $0.4m of the opposing Scheme Creditors’ claims had been

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The PwC report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In January 2010, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP
                    (“R&amp;T”), representing a group of creditors including OCBC
                    (“the Opposing Bank Creditors”), wrote to the Respondent seeking
                    copies of the proofs of debt (accompanied by supporting documents) lodged by
                    certain Scheme Creditors and other information regarding the other Scheme
                    Creditors’ claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The Respondent provided some information
                    on a “goodwill basis”, insisting at the same time that the
                    Opposing Bank Creditors were not entitled to conduct an audit of the proposed
                    Scheme Manager’s assessment of the proofs of debt filed by other Scheme

                    in announcing the voting results, the sympathetic treatment by the Scheme
                    Manager of certain proofs that were out of time and the announcement of this
                    barest satisfaction of voting requirements, the Opposing Bank Creditors were
                    dissatisfied with the result of the voting. We should add that the Respondent
                    has not clarified whether this special indulgence was granted to all creditors
                    who were tardy, or only to supporting creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> What is, however, clear to us is
                    that no prior court sanction was sought to extend the original deadline and that
                    all creditors were not officially notified of this extension of time prior to
                    its expiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The proposed Scheme Manager was, however,
                    adamant that access to the relevant proofs could and would not be given to the
                    Opposing Bank Creditors. Nevertheless, to assuage their concerns, the Respondent
                    appointed PwC on 4 February 2010 to independently review the assessment of
                    the proofs of debt undertaken by the proposed Scheme Manager.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Here, it should be

                    lodged by the Scheme Creditors related to the Respondent before the said proofs

<p class="Judg-1">Except for certain negligible

                        (at [27] of the Judgment) that
                    the two issues before her were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Scheme had been approved
                        by the requisite majority in number and value of the Scheme Creditors voting
                        in person or by proxy at the Meeting; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether there had been such lack of transparency
                        on the Respondent’s part that the Scheme should not be considered fair
                        and reasonable to the Scheme Creditors as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Judge answered the first question
                    affirmatively. First, she held that the contingent creditors could vote in the
                    same class as the other unsecured Scheme Creditors (see the Judgment
                        at [42]). The Scheme provided
                    that contingent creditors only had entitlements under the Scheme if their
                    contingent claims crystallised within five years of the effective date.
                    Notwithstanding that, the Judge found that the rights of contingent creditors
                    were not so dissimilar (from those of the other Scheme Creditors) as to make it
                    impossible for them to consult with the other Scheme Creditors (see the Judgment
                        at [41]). She stated that given
                    the financial difficulties of the Respondent, there was a real possibility that
                    the Respondent would not be able to meet its liabilities to the contingent
                    creditors, and that the contingent creditors had an interest in common with the
                    other Scheme Creditors to assess the advantages and risks of the Scheme (see the
                    Judgment at [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, the Judge held that the related
                    creditors (subsidiaries or substantial shareholders of the Respondent) had
                    rights against the Respondent which were similar to those of the other unsecured
                    Scheme Creditors and were entitled to vote in the same class as them (see the
                    Judgment at [48]). Although she
                    noted that she was entitled to attach less weight to their votes on account of
                    their special interest in the Respondent and the Scheme (see the Judgment
                        at [47]), she did not do so,
                    finding that there was no good reason to question their <em>bona
                        fides</em> (see the Judgment at [122]). She also found that the ROFRs (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) granted to Mr Sng and
                    Ms Tong did not disqualify them from voting in the same class as the other
                    unsecured Scheme Creditors. In her view, although the ROFRs might cause them to
                    have an additional private interest to support the vote, that interest was not
                    derived from their legal rights as shareholders claiming unpaid dividends from
                    the Respondent (see the Judgment at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Third, the Judge held that substantial
                    shareholders who had claims which pertained to unpaid dividends and were thus
                    subordinated in liquidation pursuant to s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Act (“the subordinated claims”) could
                    vote in the same class as the other unsecured Scheme Creditors (see the Judgment
                        at [54]). She reasoned that
                        s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Act was irrelevant as
                    it applied only when the company concerned was being wound up (see the Judgment
                        at [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Fourth, the Judge dismissed objections that
                    the Opposing Bank Creditors raised against the proposed Scheme Manager’s
                    admission or rejection of specific proofs of debt, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The questionable basis of a claim by
                        Akira Corporation Pte Ltd (“Akira Pte Ltd”), a wholly owned
                        subsidiary of the Respondent and a supporting Scheme Creditor, which saw an
                        “astronomical increase” from $5.155m as at 31 March
                        2009 to $86.97m as at the Ascertainment Date. $75.73m of Akira Pte
                        Ltd’s $86.97m claim was based on license and distribution agreements
                        with the Respondent which did not tally with the Respondent’s audited
                        and unaudited financial statements before and after the Ascertainment
                        Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        inconsistent treatment of the proofs of debt lodged by Bank of East Asia
                        (“BEA”) and St George Bank Limited
                        (“St George Bank”), in that while the security that BEA
                        (an opposing Scheme Creditor) held was deducted from its claim, the security
                        that St George Bank (a supporting Scheme Creditor) held was not
                        deducted from its claim. Also, St George Bank’s claim for $28m,
                        which was based on a guarantee granted by the Respondent for banking
                        facilities granted to its subsidiary TEAC Australia Pty Ltd (“TEAC
                        Australia”), was admitted in full. However, the Opposing Bank
                        Creditors submitted that it was unreasonable for St George Bank’s
                        claim to be admitted in full since the Respondent would be liable on the
                        corporate guarantee only if TEAC Australia failed to pay St George
                        Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        admission in full of a $53.8m claim by Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust
                        (“Ascendas”) arising from the Respondent’s corporate
                        guarantee on a lease of 10 Toh Guan Road to TT International Tradepark
                        Pte Ltd (“Tradepark”), a subsidiary of the Respondent. The
                        Opposing Bank Creditors also objected to the double counting of the $53.8m
                        claim by Ascendas and a $6.86m claim by First Capital Insurance Limited
                        (“First Capital”), which arose from the Respondent’s
                        indemnification of an insurance guarantee First Capital granted in favour of
                        Ascendas as a security deposit under the 10 Toh Guan Road lease. Both
                        Ascendas and First Capital were supporting Scheme
                Creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With respect to Akira Pte Ltd’s claim,
                    the Judge was satisfied that the claim arose properly out of, <em>inter alia</em>, the license and distribution agreements. She did not
                    have sight of the distribution agreement and was content to rely on the PwC
                    Report which described it (see the Judgment at [71]–[72]).
                    Although she noted that the Respondent’s balance sheets as
                    at 31 March 2009 did not fully reflect the Respondent’s
                    indebtedness to Akira Pte Ltd resulting from the licensing agreements, she noted
                    that the unaudited balance sheets disclaimed reliability (see the Judgment
                        at [74]). She expressed her
                    concurrence with PwC’s view that it was reasonable for the proposed Scheme
                    Manager to admit Akira Pte Ltd’s claim in full (see the Judgment
                        at [75]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Regarding BEA’s and St George
                    Bank’s claims, she noted that while BEA had already enforced its security
                    over real property, it would not make commercial sense for St George Bank
                    to enforce its security in the form of fixed or floating charges over the
                    Respondent’s assets (which excluded real property) as that would interfere
                    with the Respondent’s business operations (see the Judgment
                        at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>). Also, she noted that
                    under the Scheme, any creditor with contingent claims against the Respondent was
                    required to prove its debt in respect of its whole claim against the Respondent,
                        <em>including the amounts of any contingent claims</em>
                    (see the Judgment at [79]). On that
                    basis, she accepted that St George Bank’s $28m claim was correctly
                    admitted in full (see the Judgment at [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Next, the Judge rejected the Opposing Bank
                    Creditors’ suggestion that the admission in full of Ascendas’ $53.8m
                    claim was questionable (see the Judgment at [86]) as the claim had been verified in the PwC Report (see the
                    Judgment at [85]). As for the
                    double counting of Ascendas’ and First Capital’s claims, the Judge
                    found that the 12 November 2008 announcement and the 18 January 2010
                    press release by Ascendas which referred to Ascendas’ potential use of a
                    security deposit from an unnamed “previous anchor tenant” as
                    “bridging income” to be insufficient evidence to suggest that
                    First Capital’s security deposit had not been used to offset
                    Ascendas’ claim (see the Judgment at [89]). She also did not think that Ascendas’ claim against
                    the Respondent included the $6.86m claimed by First Capital (see the Judgment
                        at [90]). She thus concluded
                    that First Capital’s claim was reasonably admitted (see the Judgment
                        at [91]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Judge also dismissed Ho Lee’s
                    objections to the proposed Scheme Manager’s rejection of $61.79m of its
                    $84.56m claim. In particular, two heads of Ho Lee’s claims were rejected
                    wholly: (a) the damages payable to sub-contractors and suppliers due to the
                    termination of Ho Lee’s contract (“the damages claim”); and
                    (b) the loss of profits suffered due to the termination of Ho Lee’s
                    contract. Ho Lee opposed the Scheme (“the loss of profits
                    claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The PwC report concluded that these amounts
                    were reasonably rejected as they were supported by insufficient documentary
                    evidence. The Judge relied on it to find that the proposed Scheme Manager had
                    acted in a <em>bona fide</em> manner in rejecting the
                    claims (see the Judgment at [95]).
                    The Judge also stated that the proposed Scheme Manager’s “duty to
                    assess the claims presented in the proofs of debt objectively should only extend
                    to examining the claims on the basis of the supporting documentation provided by
                    the Scheme Creditors” and she found that he had fairly and reasonably
                    carried out that duty (see the Judgment at [97]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     While Ho Lee disputed the rejection of its
                    claim, the Judge adopted what was in her view the practical step forward (see
                    the Judgment at [99]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... to accept the [proposed] Scheme Manager’s rejection of [Ho
                        Lee’s] claim for the purpose of ascertaining the requisite majority,
                        leaving it open to [Ho Lee] to resort to the adjudication process to
                        determine its final entitlement under the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As regards the second issue which the Judge
                    identified (see above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), the
                    Judge found the “crucial question” to be “whether the
                    further information requested by the Opposing Bank Creditors would have caused
                    any Scheme Creditor voting in favour to change its view or any abstaining Scheme
                    Creditor to vote against the Scheme” (see the Judgment at <a href="#p1_110">[110]</a>). She thought that since PWC, whose
                    independence and qualification was unquestioned by the Opposing Bank Creditors,
                    had reconciled the claims in each proof to the source documents (which the
                    Opposing Bank Creditors had requested) and had concluded that the challenged
                    claims were reasonably admitted and rejected, then the same documentation if
                    provided to the Scheme Creditors would not have affected the voting outcome (see
                    the Judgment at [112]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Judge also held that the authorities did
                    not lay down the strict rule that the Respondent must provide supporting
                    documentation for each proof of debt so long as the same was requested by any
                    opposing creditor, or risk the Scheme being disapproved by dint of lack of
                    transparency (see the Judgment at [115]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As can be seen from our summary of the
                    Judge’s decision, the Judge relied extensively on the findings of the PwC
                    Report in evaluating the proposed Scheme Manager’s decisions to admit or
                    reject the proofs submitted by various creditors. This is an appropriate
                    juncture for us to add that we have carefully perused the PWC Report and it
                    seems to us that the authors quite rightly did not purport to make any legal
                    assessment about the correctness of the subject proofs. Our view, with respect
                    to the Judge, is that it would therefore be a mistake to place too much weight
                    on the conclusions reached in the PWC Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OCBC’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On appeal, OCBC made, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the arguments set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, scheme creditors have the right to
                    review the proofs of debt of all other scheme creditors, hence the Respondent
                    had a duty to grant OCBC access to the proofs of debt (accompanied by supporting
                    documents) filed by the other Scheme Creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Second, the court must satisfy itself that the
                    supermajority approval required under s 210(3) has been achieved. Hence,
                    where the company’s admission or rejection of a proof of debt raises
                    serious queries or doubts, the court should insist that the company provide an
                    explanation and the evidence for its decisions. In a case like the present,
                    where a slight difference in the quanta of debts admitted or rejected can swing
                    the outcome of the vote, the court must undertake a stringent inquiry. The court
                    cannot delegate this function to an independent accounting firm. Thus, the court
                    should have refused to sanction the Scheme on the basis that there was
                    insufficient evidence that the Scheme has received supermajority
                        approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Third, where a disputed debt has the potential
                    to swing the outcome of the vote, the company must exclude the disputed debt
                    from the scheme while the dispute is being resolved. If the disputed debt is
                    eventually established, the company will settle the debt or bring the debt
                    within the main scheme <em>via</em> a supplemental scheme
                    which also has to receive supermajority approval. Thus, the Respondent should
                    not have refused Ho Lee’s vote on the rejected part of its claim and yet
                    insisted that the rejected part of the claim (if ultimately established as
                    valid) be subject to the Scheme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Fourth, contingent creditors whose claims are
                    not crystallised by the Scheme cannot vote in the same class as the other
                    unsecured Scheme Creditors. The Judge’s statement that there was a real
                    possibility that the Respondent would not be able to meet the contingent
                    liabilities when they fell due was speculative. Therefore, the contingent
                    creditors should not have been allowed to vote in the general class of unsecured
                    Scheme Creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Fifth, regarding the subordinated claims, it
                    did not matter that the Respondent was not being wound up. In <em>Re Telewest Communications plc</em> [2004] BCC 342 (“<em>Re Telewest</em>”), the English High Court made clear
                        (at [29]) that “the
                    relevant rights of creditors to be compared against the terms of the scheme are
                    those which arise in an insolvent liquidation.” Therefore, the creditors
                    with subordinated claims should not have been allowed to vote in the general
                    class of unsecured Scheme Creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Sixth, Mr Sng’s and
                    Ms Tong’s ROFRs gave them additional substantive legal rights which
                    the ordinary Scheme Creditors did not enjoy. Thus, they should not have been
                    allowed to vote in the same class as other unsecured Scheme
                        Creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Seventh, the Judge ought to have treated the
                    votes of related parties sceptically and attached significantly less weight to
                    their votes in the exercise of her discretion to sanction the
                        Scheme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Eighth, as regards to its specific objections
                    to the proofs of debt filed by Akira Pte Ltd, St George Bank, Ascendas and
                    First Capital, OCBC largely repeated the arguments it submitted to the
                        Judge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ho Lee’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Apart from its arguments which adopted those
                    of OCBC (see above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>–<a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), Ho Lee
                    submitted that the Judge had erred in finding that the proposed Scheme Manager
                    had acted reasonably in a <em>bona fide</em> manner in
                    assessing Ho Lee’s claim. The crux of Ho Lee’s argument was that the
                    proposed Scheme Manager should either have asked Ho Lee to explain any of the
                    discrepancies which led to the rejection of its claims or sought technical
                    assistance from the SO, Jurong Consultants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Further, Ho Lee pointed out that its contract
                    with the Respondent was governed by cl 31.4 of the Public Sector Standard
                    Conditions of Contract for Construction Works (2006 Edition), which states that
                    the SO shall certify payment to the contractor for work executed prior to the
                    date of termination (including the cost of materials reasonably ordered for the
                    works) and any loss and expense suffered by the contractor in connection with
                    the employer’s termination; yet, the Respondent did not appoint the SO to
                    certify Ho Lee’s claim despite the SO volunteering to do so. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Section 210 of the Act, as its heading
                    states, confers on a company that meets the stipulated criteria the <b>“[p]ower to compromise with creditors and
                    members</b>”. This court has recently considered the purpose of
                    schemes of arrangement under s 210 in <em>The Oriental

                    affirm our agreement (see <em>Oriental Insurance</em>
                        at [38]) with

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>16.2</b>
                Section 210
                            [of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed)] provides for
                            schemes of arrangement to be binding on creditors and members alike
                            after the requisite approval by the specified majority and upon
                            confirmation by the court. <em>This section obviates the
                                need for a messy and complicated series of negotiations with a view
                                to obtaining the unanimous approval of the members or creditors to a
                                novation or assignment or other variation of their
                                rights.</em> A scheme of arrangement may be proposed where it
                            is desired to adjust members' or creditors' rights <em>inter se</em>, or to reorganise the share capital of the
                            company, or in the case of a group, ... [with a view to] reconstruction
                            or merger. In particular, recourse to s 210 is often made when it
                            is desired to compromise creditors' claims against an insolvent company.

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>Re Hawk Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 2 BCLC 480 (“<em>Re Hawk
                        Insurance</em>”), Chadwick LJ instructively outlined the
                    process by which a compromise or arrangement became binding on the company and
                    its creditors <em>via</em> s 425 (“the UK
                    s 425”) of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) (“the 1985 UK
                    Act”) (the UK s 425 is <em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with s 210 of the Act;
                    it has since been replaced by s 895 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46)
                    (UK)). Chadwick LJ pointed out (at [11]–[12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    … First, there must be an application to the
                            court under s 425(1) of [the 1985 UK Act] for an order that a
                            meeting or meetings be summoned. It is at that stage that a decision
                            needs to be taken as to whether or not to summon more than one meeting;
                            and, if so, who should be summoned to which meeting. Second, the scheme
                            proposals are put to the meeting or meetings held in accordance with the
                            order that has been made; and are approved (or not) by the requisite
                            majority in number and value of those present and voting in person or by
                            proxy. Thirdly, if approved at the meeting or meetings, there must be a
                            further application to the court under s 425(2) of [the 1985 UK
                            Act] to obtain the court's sanction to the compromise or
                            arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    It can be seen that each of those stages serves a
                            distinct purpose. At the first stage the court directs how the meeting
                            or meetings are to be summoned. It is concerned, at that stage, to
                            ensure that those who are to be affected by the compromise or
                            arrangement proposed have a proper opportunity of being present (in
                            person or by proxy) at the meeting or meetings at which the proposals
                            are to be considered and voted upon. The second stage ensures that the
                            proposals are acceptable to at least a majority in number, representing
                            three-fourths in value, of those who take the opportunity of being
                            present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting or meetings. At the third
                            stage the court is concerned (i) to ensure that the meeting or
                            meetings have been summoned and held in accordance with its previous
                            order, (ii) to ensure that the proposals have been approved by the
                            requisite majority of those present at the meeting or meetings and
                            (iii) to ensure that the views and interests of those who have not
                            approved the proposals at the meeting or meetings (either because they
                            were not present or, being present, did not vote in favour of the
                            proposals) receive impartial consideration. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     While the passages cited above are helpful in
                    outlining the general procedure by which a scheme of arrangement is finalised,
                    there appears to be a paucity of judicial guidance on the more precise mechanics
                    of implementation. Also, as OCBC took pains to emphasise, there is no statutory
                    guidance on the many procedural issues relating to passing a scheme of
                    arrangement under s 210.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> These issues relate, <em>inter alia</em>, to the conduct of creditors’ meetings
                    as well as the admission and rejection of proofs of debt. Therefore, we think it
                    will be useful to companies and their creditors for us to further particularise
                    the proper procedures that ought to be adopted in the local context <em>vis-à-vis</em> s 210 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">First stage: formal steps towards the scheme creditors’
                meeting(s)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The first formal step towards obtaining
                    approval for a scheme of arrangement is for the subject company to apply
                        <em>ex parte</em> to court for a meeting of all
                    creditors, or meetings of all classes of creditors to approve the scheme
                    (“scheme creditors’ meeting(s)”). The court can grant such
                    an application pursuant to s 210(1), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        Law</em> (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 1994, Issue 37 (July 2011
                    release)) at p L6 states correctly at para 53 that at this stage,
                    “[o]ne of the key tasks and responsibilities of the promoter of a scheme
                    of arrangement is to classify its creditors according to their separate
                    interests.” This is not just a matter of form. If the scheme
                    creditors’ meeting(s) are not properly conducted, the court has no
                    jurisdiction to sanction the proposed scheme (see <em>UDL Argos
                        Engineering &amp; Heavy Industries Co Ltd &amp; Others v Li Oi Lin &amp;
                        Others</em> [2001] 3 HKLRD 634 (“<em>UDL
                        Argos</em>”) at [27(5)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In England, the practice regarding
                    applications to court for meetings is governed by an updated Practice Statement
                    (Companies: Schemes of Arrangement) [2002] 1 WLR 1345 (“the
                    Practice Statement”) that replaced an earlier Practice Note issued in
                    1934 (see Practice Note [1934] WN 142). The Practice Statement states that it is
                    the applicant’s responsibility to determine whether more than one meeting
                    of creditors is required by the scheme and for that purpose, to notify persons
                    affected by the scheme of its purpose and the meetings which the applicant
                    considers will be required. <em>The court, in considering whether
                        or not to order meetings of creditors, “will consider whether more
                        than one meeting of creditors is required and if so what is the appropriate
                        composition of those meetings</em>” [emphasis added] (see the
                    Practice Statement at 1345G). <em>It is also stated that it
                        is the applicant’s responsibility to raise any issues relating to
                        creditors to the court for its directions.</em> Notwithstanding the
                    above, it is further provided that creditors who consider themselves unfairly
                    treated will still be able to raise objections at the sanction hearing, though
                    the court will expect a good explanation for why they were not raised
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Lord Millett NPJ’s view in the
                    Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal case of <em>UDL Argos</em>,
                    which suggests that issues of creditors’ classification should rather be
                    left to the sanction hearing (see below at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>), should also be noted. This particular view was grounded
                    on the belief that processes seeking to address those issues earlier could
                    prematurely attract contentious legal proceedings which might otherwise have
                    been avoidable (see <em>UDL Argos</em> at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It might be thought singularly unhelpful to leave the question whether the
                        meetings were correctly convened to the third stage, by which time a wrong
                        decision by the company at the outset will have led to a considerable waste
                        of time and money. <em>But in my opinion the practice is a
                            sound one. The only alternative would be to require notice of the
                            initial application to be made</em> inter partes <em>and for notice of the application together with a copy of the
                            Scheme to be given to everyone potentially affected by it, with the risk
                            of incurring the costs of a contested hearing and possible appeals
                            before it could be known whether the Scheme was likely to attract
                            sufficient support in any event.</em> The present practice ensures
                        that those advising the company take their responsibility seriously, since
                        an error on their part will be fatal to the Scheme. At the same time it
                        leaves the question, which goes to the jurisdiction of the Court to sanction
                        the Scheme, to be decided at the appropriate time, that is to say when the
                        Court is asked to sanction it. By then the outcome of the meeting or
                        meetings will be known and the question, which will no longer be
                        hypothetical, can be argued between the appropriate parties, that is to say
                        the company on the one hand and those who object to the Scheme on the other.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     While Lord Millett NPJ’s view
                    certainly has some force, it seems to us that it avoids the classic chicken and
                    egg conundrum facing every applicant. Indeed, without a preliminary
                    determination of the correct classification of creditors, how can it be known
                    whether a scheme is likely to attract sufficient support and subsequently pass
                    muster? Further, if it were certain from the outset that certain opposing
                    creditors would be classified separately so that the scheme would never pass,
                    then it would be a futile exercise to even conduct scheme creditors’
                    meetings. The reality of what happens in practice has also to be factored into
                    this dynamic process. Almost invariably, the applicant would have made the
                    effort to ascertain, as best as it could at an early stage, prior to any court
                    application, how particular creditors might be inclined to vote.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Concerns about delays and contentious
                    proceedings at an early stage may be somewhat overstated as the court has
                    complete carriage over timelines and the conduct of the proceedings. In our
                    view, even if there is a need at this stage to hear potentially dissenting
                    creditors, such a hearing could usually be conducted expeditiously and
                    summarily. Having considered the relative advantages of both approaches, we are
                    inclined to prefer the approach in the Practice Statement which commends itself
                    for the greater degree of certainty it injects into the process of passing a
                    scheme. The adoption of this procedure in Singapore requires the company’s
                    solicitors, when applying for an order to summon the scheme creditors’
                    meeting, <em>to unreservedly disclose all material
                        information</em> to the court to assist it in arriving at a properly
                    considered determination on how the scheme creditors’ meeting is to be
                    conducted. Any issues in relation to a possible need for separate meetings for
                    different classes of creditors ought to be unambiguously brought to the
                    attention of the court hearing the application. <em>As time is
                        ordinarily of the essence in such applications, all scheme related matters
                        </em><em>(including appeals therefrom) should be heard
                        on an expedited basis.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Following the court’s consideration of
                    the issues raised by the applicant and the creditors in relation to the
                    creditors’ meetings for the proposed scheme, it may give directions for
                    the calling of scheme creditors’ meeting(s). However, two points should be
                    noted. First, the court should not consider the merits and fairness of the
                    scheme at this stage, as this stage really concerns the court’s
                    jurisdiction to sanction the scheme later if it proceeds. In this regard,
                        <em>Re Telewest</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>) at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> (approved by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Re Telewest Communications plc</em> [2005] BCC 29
                        (“<em>Re </em><em>Telewest
                        Communications plc</em>”) at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In considering the primary position of the opposing bondholders, <em>it is important to keep in mind the function of the court at
                            this stage. This is an application by the companies for leave to convene
                            meetings to consider the schemes. It is emphatically not a hearing to
                            consider the merits and fairness of the schemes.</em> Those
                        aspects are among the principal matters for decision at the later hearing to
                        sanction the schemes, if they are approved by the statutory majorities of
                        creditors. <em>The matters for consideration at this stage
                            concern the jurisdiction of the court to sanction the scheme if it
                            proceeds. There is no point in the court convening meetings to consider
                            the scheme if it can be seen now that it will lack the jurisdiction to
                            sanction it later. This is principally a matter of the composition of
                            classes.</em> ... <em>and the practice now is to
                            deal so far as possible with issues of class composition at the first
                            stage of the application for leave to convene meetings.</em> There
                        might exceptionally be other issues which would go to jurisdiction and could
                        be properly raised at this stage: see <em>Re Savoy Hotel
                            Ltd</em> [1981] Ch 351. <em>What the
                            court should not do is to consider the fairness of the scheme with a
                            view to deciding whether at the later hearing it will or will not
                            sanction it.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Second, it should be borne in mind that where
                    there is no realistic prospect of a scheme receiving the requisite approval, the
                    court should not act in vain in granting the application for meetings to be
                    convened: see <em>Re Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2005] SGHC 112 at [9].
                    This is something that the applicant’s solicitors and the proposed scheme
                    manager should take into account prior to making an application for leave to
                    convene a scheme creditors’ meeting. A failure to make a conscientious
                    assessment of the likely prospects of scheme approval may result in adverse
                    costs orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the event that the court issues directions
                    for the calling of scheme creditors’ meeting(s), notices summoning the
                    meeting(s) must be sent to the creditors. Section 211 of the Act requires
                    that such notices be accompanied by a statement that clearly explains the intent
                    and purport of the compromise or arrangement and, in particular, discloses any
                    material interests of the directors and the effect of the scheme thereon.
                    Further, it is essential that the explanatory circular must be “<em>perfectly fair and, as far as possible, give all the information
                        reasonably necessary to enable the recipients to determine how to
                        vote</em>”: <em>In re Dorman, Long and Company
                        Limited</em> [1934] Ch 635 at 657. Although s 211
                    does not expressly require it, a copy of the scheme of arrangement document and
                    a proxy form for the creditor’s use at the scheme creditors’ meeting
                    should usually be enclosed to ensure that the creditors have adequate
                    information about the proposed scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     After this, the prospective scheme creditors
                    will submit their proofs of debt together with any supporting documents to the
                    chairman of the meeting(s) for his adjudication. We pause to note that since the
                    chairman of the meeting is almost invariably the proposed scheme manager (or his
                    nominee), our references to chairmen (in the context of the s 210 scheme
                    creditors’ meetings) below may be taken generally as references to
                    proposed scheme managers as well. Generally, submissions have to be made before
                    a “cut-off point” stated in the scheme document and highlighted in
                    the s 211 explanatory statement. If the chairman wishes to extend the time
                    for submission of proofs, not only should prior court sanction for this be
                    sought, all creditors should also be informed to ensure that the extension of
                    time benefits all, and not merely a particular group of sympathetic
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The chairman then has to perform the
                    quasi-judicial task of adjudicating upon disputes as to the voting rights of
                    anyone claiming to be a creditor. The chairman cannot act capriciously or
                    arbitrarily and must determine issues objectively. His role is akin to that of a
                    judicial manager in deciding whether to admit or reject proofs of debt lodged
                    with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Second stage: the conduct of the scheme creditors’
                meeting(s)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As in the lead up to creditors’ meetings
                    in the judicial management context (see <em>ERPIMA SA v Chee Yoh
                        </em><em>Chuang and another</em> [1997]
                    1 SLR(R) 923 at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>), the
                    entire process of proof, admission or rejection is ordinarily completed before
                    the scheme creditors’ meeting(s) is held. Although s 210 does not
                    expressly spell this out, it has also become the usual practice for the chairman
                    to post a list of the creditors and the corresponding amounts of their admitted
                    claims (for the purpose of voting) at the meeting venue prior to the meeting.
                    Disclosure of material information about the scheme or the company’s
                    affairs ought not to be deliberately withheld until the meeting so as to
                    influence its outcome. This would unfairly prejudice those which may have
                    decided not to attend after considering the information sent to them earlier and
                    will likely be seen as an attempt to improperly influence the voting
                    outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     After the creditors cast their votes, the
                    chairman will immediately thereafter tabulate the results and announce them by
                    the end of the meeting. Section 210(3) of the Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    
              <em>If a majority in number
                                representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class
                                of creditors or members or class of members present and voting
                                either in person or by proxy at the meeting</em> or the
                            adjourned meeting <em>agrees to any compromise or
                                arrangement</em>, the compromise or arrangement shall, if
                            approved by order of the Court, be binding on all the creditors or
                            class of creditors or on the members or class of members, as the
                            case may be, and also on the company or, in the case of a
                            company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator and
                            contributories of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, if the proposed scheme is accepted (within each designated
                    class, if any), by a majority in number of the creditors (present and voting)
                    who hold at least 75% of the total debts owed by the company (to the respective
                    designated classes, if any), the proposed scheme can proceed to the third
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Third stage: seeking the court’s approval</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The third stage of the process is an
                    application to the court for its approval of the scheme. This requirement is
                    underscored by s 210(3) which states that the scheme will become binding
                    only “if approved by order of the Court”. As explained earlier
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>–<a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>), s 210 allows a majority of creditors
                    to “cram down” on the rights of a minority of objecting creditors
                    and implement a scheme notwithstanding the latter’s objections. The
                    requirement of the court’s approval serves as an additional crucial check
                    to ensure the integrity of voting outcome(s) at the scheme creditors’
                    meeting(s) and the objective fairness of the proposed scheme. In <em>Oriental Insurance</em> (at [43]), we reaffirmed that the court must be satisfied of three
                    matters before it sanctions a scheme, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    The court must be satisfied that the statutory
                            provisions have been complied with. For example, the court must be
                            satisfied that the resolution is passed by the requisite statutory
                            majority at a meeting of the company's creditors or members (as the case

                            convening the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The court must be satisfied that those who
                            attended the meeting were fairly representative of the class of
                            creditors or the class of members (where applicable), and that the
                            statutory majority did not coerce the minority in order to promote
                            interests adverse to those of the class whom the statutory majority
                            purported to represent.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    The court must be satisfied that the scheme is one

                            reasonably approve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If the court is so satisfied, it will issue an order of court
                    approving the scheme. When that order is lodged with the Registrar of Companies

                    creditors) pursuant to s 210(5) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Transparency and objectivity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Plainly, the integrity of voting outcome(s) of
                    the scheme creditors’ meeting(s) is dependent upon the fairness of the
                    proof of debt adjudication process. The objectivity of the chairman is a
                    critical aspect of the entire process. Regarding the objectivity of the
                    chairman, we find the following passage from Edward Bailey and Huge Groves,
                        <em>Corporate Insolvency: Law and Practice</em>,
                    (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2007) (“<em>Bailey &amp;
                        Groves</em>”) at p 260, para 9.45 referring to the
                    chairman of a creditors’ meeting leading to a Company Voluntary
                    Arrangement (“CVA”) (a corporate rescue mechanism broadly similar
                    to that of a s 210 scheme of arrangement) under the United Kingdom’s
                    Insolvency Act 1986, equally apposite in defining the role of the chairman of a
                    scheme creditors’ meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The chairman should bear well in mind that, whatever concerns he may have
                        as to the approval of an arrangement with which he has been involved and
                        where he may become the supervisor, <em>it is important that
                            he approach the task of valuing debts in an independent manner without
                            regard to the likely way in which the creditor holding the debt may
                            vote.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The proposed scheme manager’s
                    responsibility to be independent in managing differences between the company and
                    creditors is in a broad sense not different from the legal obligation imposed on
                    other insolvency practitioners, <em>eg</em>, a liquidator.
                    In this regard, our observations in <em>Fustar Chemicals Ltd
                        (Hong Kong) v Liquidator of Fustar Chemicals Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 458 (“<em>Fustar</em>”)
                        at [18] are pertinent in so far
                    as the chairman’s duty of adjudicating proofs is concerned:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle that can also be gleaned from this brief overview is that
                        the duty of the liquidator in assessing a proof of debt is to ensure that
                        while genuine debts are admitted and false claims are rejected, he must act
                            <em>fairly</em> in discharging his duties. He must,
                        at all times, be independent and hold an even hand in dealing with the often
                        competing interests of creditors, contributories and his appointers.
                            <em>A liquidator must never favour the interests of his
                            appointers over that of the other legitimate claimants to the company's
                            assets</em>.[ emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Notwithstanding that s 210 is silent on
                    the issues of transparency and objectivity, we cannot overstate the importance
                    of respecting and safeguarding the integrity of the voting outcomes of the
                    scheme creditors’ meeting(s). The minority creditor will be involuntarily
                    bound by a scheme which it voted against. Its property rights might be very
                    severely affected or compromised in a scheme. Often this could involve deep
                    “haircuts”, <em>ie</em>, accepting the
                    repayment of an amount which is significantly less than the outstanding debt in
                    full settlement of the debt. Its opposing vote suggests that it would prefer for
                    the company to go into liquidation than to be bound by the scheme. <em>If the minority creditor is to be “crammed down” upon
                        by the majority, then it has every right to insist that the majority is
                        constituted strictly in compliance with </em><em>the
                        requirements of </em><em>s 210 and that the
                        chairman of the meeting scrupulously discharges his responsibilities
                        fairly.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evolving nature of the proposed scheme manager’s
                duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Before moving onto other aspects of this
                    matter, it is apt that we make some observations on the proposed scheme
                    manager’s duties. The proposed scheme manager is engaged by a company that
                    is usually in a parlous financial position. He formulates a scheme of
                    arrangement to save the company and pitches it to the creditors to secure
                    approval of his plan. At that stage of the process, he owes no direct duties to
                    the creditors, save of course that he must act in good faith and must not
                    mislead creditors or suppress material information from them. It is trite law
                    that the court will not sanction a scheme if the company and/or its majority
                    creditors are not acting <em>bona fide</em> (see <em>Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd v CEL Tractors Pte Ltd</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 791 at [36]). It
                    follows that before the scheme is sanctioned, the proposed scheme manager has a
                    good faith obligation to the company and the body of creditors as a whole as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As stated above at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>, the proposed scheme manager’s duties
                    are then amplified when he assumes the quasi-judicial role of adjudicating on
                    the admission and rejection of the proofs of debts. We mentioned <em>Fustar</em> earlier (see above at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>) for the proposition that “[a]
                    liquidator must never favour the interests of his appointers over that of the
                    other legitimate claimants to the company's assets” [original emphasis
                    omitted]. The same is true for a proposed scheme manager in the discharge of his
                    responsibility of adjudicating proofs. In his quasi-judicial role, he owes
                    duties to be objective, independent, fair and impartial (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>–<a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As for his duties upon appointment as scheme
                    manager, we again think it fitting to refer to the office of the liquidator as a
                    comparator. It is well-established that liquidators are fiduciaries, owing
                    duties to, <em>inter alia</em>, the company and its
                    creditors. In this regard, see Andrew R Keay, <em>McPherson’s </em><em>Law of Company
                        Liquidation</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2009) ("<em>McPherson</em>") at para 8.018:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>1. Fiduciary duties</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the practical point of view it does not seem to matter much whether
                        the liquidator is treated as a trustee in the strict sense or simply as an
                        agent, <em>for in either capacity a fiduciary position in
                            relation to the company, its creditors and contributories is
                            occupied.</em> ... In addition, two further duties of major
                        importance follow from the fiduciary relationship: (a) that the
                        liquidator must not allow private interests to come into conflict with
                        duties, <em>and (b) that in discharging the duties he or
                            she must at all times act with complete impartiality as between the
                            various persons interested in the property and liabilities of the
                            company.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Earlier versions of the same passage (without material differences)
                    were approved by the Federal Court of Australia in <em>Pace and
                        another v Antlers Pty Ltd (in liq)</em> [1998] 26 ACSR 490
                    at 501 and Olney J in <em>Re G K Pty Ltd (in liq); Ex
                        parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation</em> (1983) 7 ACLR 633
                    at 639 respectively. In our view, the proposed scheme manager’s
                    duties to administer the approved scheme take on a fiduciary nature upon his
                    appointment as the scheme manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conflict of interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     To an extent, the proposed scheme manager is
                    inherently in a position of conflict because if he successfully resuscitates the
                    company, he is remunerated, <em>inter alia</em>, for
                    managing the scheme and reviving the company. Therefore, there are undeniable
                    incentives for the proposed scheme manager to prefer the interests of his
                    appointers (not infrequently, the company itself as is the case here) over those
                    of their creditors from the outset. He must, nevertheless, seek to strike the
                        <em>right balance</em> and manage the competing
                    interests of successfully securing the approval of his proposed scheme and
                    uncompromisingly respecting the procedural rights of all involved in the scheme
                    process. It must also be appreciated that an informed voting process can only
                    take place if all material information a creditor might need to determine how to
                    vote is made available (see <em>Wah Yuen Electrical Engineering
                        Pte Ltd v Singapore Cables Manufacturers Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 629 (“<em>Wah Yuen</em>”)
                        at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     A proposed scheme manager goes too far when he
                    begins to align his interests with those of the company beyond what we have
                    described above. The temptation to do so is especially acute when his initial
                    appointers are not the creditors, but the company’s management. In this
                    case, the proposed Scheme Manager was also surprisingly the nominee for the IVAs
                    filed by Mr Sng and Ms Tong. The success of those IVAs in turn
                    depended heavily on the success of the Scheme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> In our view, this additional
                    relationship with Mr Sng and Ms Tong, key personnel of the Respondent,
                    was inappropriate because it put the proposed Scheme Manager in an unacceptable
                    position of unavoidable conflict of interest. Therefore, we ordered the proposed
                    Scheme Manager to elect either to continue as such only or as nominee for
                    Mr Sng and Ms Tong in their proposed IVAs only (see Annexure I
                        at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>). He eventually chose to
                    act for the Respondent alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether scheme creditors are entitled to examine the proofs of debt
                submitted by other creditors in respect of a proposed scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In considering the submission that creditors
                    have the right to review the proofs of debt submitted by all other creditors in
                    respect of a proposed scheme, the Judge held (the Judgment at [115]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not read the authorities as laying down the strict rule that so long
                        as any opposing creditor asks for the supporting documentation for each
                        proof of debt, the Company must of necessity provide the requested
                        information in that form or else risk denial of the court’s approval
                        of the scheme of arrangement by dint of lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Judge also reasoned that
                        (at [110]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the] crucial question [relating to whether the Respondent had provided
                        sufficient information] was whether the further information requested by the
                        Opposing Bank Creditors would have caused any Scheme Creditor voting in
                        favour to change its view or any abstaining Scheme Creditor to vote against
                        the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     She also eventually came to the view
                        (at [119]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there was no lack of transparency on the part of the [Respondent]. It had
                        provided sufficient accurate information with regard to its assets and
                        liabilities and those of its subsidiaries to enable the Scheme Creditors to
                        make an informed choice between the Scheme and taking their chances at
                        liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In her determination, the Judge relied on the
                    case of <em>Wah Yuen</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>) which was decided by this court; as well as
                    the subsequent High Court cases of <em>Re Econ Corp
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 273 (“<em>Re
                        Econ</em>”) and <em>Re Horizon Knowledge
                        Solutions Pte Ltd</em> [2004] SGHC 270 (“<em>Re Horizon</em>”), both of which relied on <em>Wah Yuen</em>. In <em>Wah Yuen</em>,
                    this court found that the company presenting its scheme of arrangement for
                    approval “had not been sufficiently transparent about the circumstances
                    in which the related parties’ debts were incurred” (see holding (5)
                    of the headnote). As a result, this court withheld its approval for the proposed
                    scheme of arrangement because it found “that the creditors were not in a
                    position to assess the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme.” (See
                        <em>Wah Yuen</em> at [37]) This court explained (also at [37]) that this was because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he creditors could not determine whether the returns under the proposed
                        scheme of arrangement were <em>in fact</em> greater than what they could
                        expect in a liquidation. It may well be that a proper verification of the
                        related party debts would reveal that the related party debts did not in
                        fact exist to the extent currently represented. In such a scenario, the
                        returns to the creditors in a liquidation would be larger than that
                        currently estimated. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In this appeal, OCBC’s complaint was not
                    so much that the creditors had insufficient accurate information to make an
                    informed choice between the Scheme and liquidation or that given more
                    information, they might have voted differently. Rather, its complaint was that
                    it had inadequate information “to assess whether the [proposed] Scheme
                    Manager’s decisions in admitting and rejecting the proofs of debts were
                        proper”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> OCBC was not seeking more information to
                    evaluate the Scheme against a liquidation scenario. Rather, it was seeking more
                    information to assess whether the proposed Scheme Manager’s decision to
                    admit the claims of certain creditors was proper. OCBC rightly submitted that
                    the Judge did not adequately appreciate that the two complaints are
                        different.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The question in <em>Wah
                        Yuen</em> was whether the scheme there should have been sanctioned
                    given that the lack of transparency regarding the related party debts prevented
                    the creditors from assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme. The
                    issue raised by OCBC, however, was rather different: whether scheme creditors
                    are entitled to examine the proofs of debt submitted by other scheme creditors
                    to ensure the integrity of the voting process regardless of whether they are
                    related parties or not. (We use the general term “scheme creditor”
                    generously in this context, describing also creditors who have submitted proofs
                    in respect of a proposed scheme that has yet to be passed.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The issue of access to proofs of debt requires
                    an assessment of the rights and interests of individual creditors in relation to
                    the collective interests of the other creditors and the company. We have
                    highlighted earlier (see above at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>)
                    why it is imperative for the process through which proofs of debt are
                    adjudicated upon and admitted to be transparent. However, we also recognise the
                    force of the Respondent’s contention that the easier it is for individual
                    creditors to challenge the chairman’s decisions on the adjudication and
                    admission of proofs of debt, the more difficult it might be to get the scheme
                    off the ground and this may unnecessarily frustrate the creditors supporting the
                    scheme (possibly forming the requisite statutory majority) while the company
                    convulses and shrivels into terminal decline in the meantime. Certainly, the
                    quicker the scheme gets sanctioned, the earlier the company can be
                    rescued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Indeed, in <em>Wah
                        Yuen</em>, this court remarked at [18] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]f it were a condition precedent that a company had to satisfy each
                        creditor of the genesis and extent of all of its debts before the scheme
                        could be put to the vote, the entire process would be cumbersome and
                        administratively inconvenient, especially when the scheme might itself
                        already provide for a procedure for the adjudication of claims for voting
                        purposes (as it did in this case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     However, OCBC submitted that there should be
                    symmetry on this issue with the related regimes of bankruptcy and insolvency as
                    a scheme is usually proposed in lieu of liquidation. Rule 179 of the
                    Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the

                    the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 50, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Companies (Winding Up) Rules”) or the Companies Regulations
                    (Cap 50, Rg 1, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the Companies
                    Regulations”), these rules and regulations do also contemplate
                    creditors’ challenges of liquidators’ and judicial managers’
                    decisions in respect of proofs of debt (see rr 93 and 95 of the Companies
                    (Winding Up) Rules; and regs 80 and 82 of the Companies Regulations). The
                    Bankruptcy Rules also have similar provisions (at rr 198 and 201) which
                    provide for creditors’ challenges of decisions of the Official Assignee or
                    trustees, as the case might be. OCBC submitted that these provisions imply that
                    creditors generally have the right to inspect the proofs of debt filed by other
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As an example, we set out r 93 of the

                            the time, no application to reverse or vary the decision of the
                            liquidator in a winding up by the Court rejecting a proof sent to him by
                            a creditor, or person claiming to be a creditor, shall be entertained,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     We noted that r 93 might be read as
                    merely allowing a creditor to apply to court to reverse or vary the
                    liquidator’s decision as to its own proof (and not the proofs of other
                    creditors). However, on reflection, it seems to us that if that were the case,
                    r 93 would refer to the creditor’s own proof of debt as “its
                    proof” rather than “a proof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     We noted further that in England and Wales,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     We did not disagree with OCBC’s
                    submission that all the local insolvency and bankruptcy regimes allow creditors
                    to inspect the proofs of debt submitted by other creditors and challenge the
                    admission of the other creditors’ claims, but the competing interests in a
                    proposed scheme of arrangement are not the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In a proposed scheme of arrangement, the
                    interest of a creditor is different from that of a creditor in a liquidation or
                    a judicial management. In a proposed scheme of arrangement he has an autonomous
                    voting right which may be critical to the jurisdiction of the court to sanction
                    the scheme. Hence, claims to be given access to proofs of debt filed by other
                    creditors can only be justified if the information is relevant to his voting
                    rights. The creditor has a positive “right” to be given his voting
                    rights according to the value of his lawful claims against the company, and he
                    also has a negative “right” to protect his voting rights from
                    being whittled down by excessive voting rights given to another creditor. Of
                    course, he has an interest in the eventual payout if the scheme is proved, but
                    may prefer not to have that payout, and instead may vote against the proposed
                    scheme so that he could recover his claim in a liquidation. In principle,
                    therefore, a creditor has no legal right to have access to the proofs of debt of
                    other creditors, except where his voting rights have been or are likely to be
                    affected. In other words, he is entitled to access only if he produces <em>prima facie</em> evidence of impropriety in the admission or
                    rejection of such proofs of debt. At the hearing, we queried why OCBC did not
                    apply earlier to the court for an order that the Respondent disclose the proofs
                    of debt and supporting documentation which it requested. Counsel for OCBC
                    responded that such an application was then unprecedented. In our view, if the
                    proposed chairman of a scheme creditors’ meeting rejects a scheme
                    creditor’s request for the disclosure of other scheme creditors’
                    proofs of debt (together with supporting documentation), there is no bar against
                    the requesting scheme creditor applying to court for an order that the proofs
                    and supporting documentation be disclosed to it. The court will determine this
                    issue after weighing the rights of the applicant creditors against the
                    collective interests of the other creditors and the company, taking into account
                    any allegations about the <em>prima facie</em> dubiousness
                    of the challenged debts. To this, we also add that should the proofs in question
                    contain confidential information pertaining to the other creditors or the
                    company, the court should ensure that there are proper safeguards to address any
                    issues of confidentiality that have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When a scheme creditor should be notified of the chairman’s
                decisions to admit or reject its own and other creditors’ proofs of
                debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>, it is common practice for the chairman to
                    post a list of the scheme creditors and the corresponding amounts of their
                    admitted claims (for the purpose of voting) at the meeting venue before the
                    creditors’ meeting. In describing the conduct of the analogous meeting for
                    a CVA (see above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a>), Bailey &amp;
                    Groves states at para 9.47 that “[t]he first task of the chairman
                    will usually be to determine who is entitled to vote and in what
                    amounts.” This ought to be done before the votes are cast at the
                    creditors’ meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     This practice is sound as it safeguards the
                    integrity of the voting outcome. The creditors commence voting knowing how much
                    their votes will count with or against those of their fellow creditors. In
                    addition, the information allows some measure of informed consultation between
                    the creditors regarding the exercise of their votes. This is likely to lead to a
                    more considered and informed vote by the body of creditors as a
                whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In the present case, the proposed Scheme
                    Manager, in conducting the Scheme Meeting, did not adopt the practice referred
                    to above at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>–<a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>. Prior to the meeting, the Scheme Creditors
                    were not provided by the proposed Scheme Manager with a list of Scheme Creditors
                    and the corresponding quanta of their claims that had been admitted for the
                    purpose of voting. This was notwithstanding that counsel for OCBC had earlier
                    written to the proposed Scheme Manager to request for a full list of the claims
                    lodged by the Scheme Creditors for the purpose of voting and the amount of those
                        claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Further, as explained above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, although the Scheme Creditors were first
                    informed that the voting results would be released after the trading day
                    at 5.00pm, they were then unexpectedly informed after 5.00pm that the
                    proposed Scheme Manager had in fact not completed his adjudication of the proofs
                    of debt submitted to him. The proposed Scheme Manager eventually reported the
                    results of the Scheme Meeting slightly over two months later in the
                    Chairman’s Report on 17 December 2009 (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>). As a consequence of the proposed Scheme
                    Manager’s unexplained conduct of the Scheme Meeting, doubts were
                    understandably sown in the minds of some opposing creditors about the integrity
                    of the voting process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     During the subsequent two-month period between
                    the Scheme Meeting and the Chairman’s Report, the proposed Scheme Manager
                    knew precisely which way each creditor had voted but had not determined how much
                    of each creditor’s claim was to be admitted. In the apt words of
                    Mr Thio, lead counsel for Ho Lee, this gave the proposed Scheme Manager
                    “perfect foresight” when it came to adjudicating the claims
                    submitted for the purpose of voting. Mr Thio did not go so far as to allege
                    dishonesty on the part of the proposed Scheme Manager; however, he did suggest
                    that the proposed Scheme Manager might have suffered from a confirmation bias -
                    which created a predisposition towards the hypercritical examination of evidence
                    contrary to his own desired position (<em>ie</em>,
                    documents supporting Ho Lee’s proof of debt). While we need not determine
                    this issue, we are constrained to observe that we find it unsatisfactory that
                    the proposed Scheme Manager had placed himself in a situation that invited such
                    criticism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As we have explained earlier (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>), the transparency of
                    proofs of debt adjudication process and the objectivity of the chairman in
                    evaluating the proofs are key aspects of every s 210 scheme. As the scheme
                    created binds and often severely prejudices dissenting creditors, it is only
                    fair that the integrity of the s 210 procedure be scrupulously observed.
                    Therefore, in our view, before the Scheme Meeting took place, the proposed
                    Scheme Manager should have:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     completed adjudicating all proofs of
                        debt; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     provided all the Scheme Creditors present with the full list of Scheme
                        Creditors entitled to vote and the corresponding quanta of their claims that
                        were admitted for the purpose of voting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A proposed
                    scheme manager who cannot comply with the above prior to the scheme
                    creditors’ meeting should act prudently and seek from the court leave to
                    defer the meeting until after the adjudication is completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a scheme creditor may appeal the chairman’s decisions
                to admit or reject its own and other creditors’ proofs of debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As stated above at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>, there is no subsidiary legislation governing
                    the admission and rejection of proofs of debt in relation to creditors’
                    meetings summoned to consider a proposed scheme of arrangement under s 210.
                    However, comparably in the context of judicial management (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>), the Companies Regulations
                    provide for admission and rejection of proofs in, <em>inter

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The provisions relating to the admission and
                    rejection of proofs of debt in the Companies Regulations and the Companies
                    (Winding Up) Rules are not, however, free from difficulties. For example, if a
                    creditor is entitled to vote under reg 72 of the Companies Regulations
                    having duly lodged his proof of debt with the judicial manager, it is not clear
                    how the chairman may reject his proof for the purpose of voting under
                    reg 75 (see further the discussion of the Australian statutory
                    “cousins” of the said provisions (regs 5.6.23 and 5.6.26 of
                    the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth)) in <em>Selim v
                        McGrath</em> [2003] NSWSC 927 (<em>Selim v
                        McGrath</em>) at [88]–[106],
                    endorsed by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <em>Bacnet Pty Ltd and Others v Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd (in liq)
                        and Others</em> [2010] FCAFC 36 (“<em>Bacnet</em>”) at [76]). Nevertheless, in considering the admission and rejection
                    of proofs of debt by the chairman of a s 210 creditors’ meeting, it
                    is worth bearing in mind the commonsensical procedure in these provisions. For
                    convenience, all references made below to provisions in the Companies
                    Regulations should be concurrently taken as references to their corresponding
                    provisions in the Companies (Winding Up) Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Thus, the chairman of a s 210
                    creditors’ meeting has three options when assessing a contentious claim
                    for the purpose of voting. First, he might admit the claim wholly. Second, he
                    might reject a claim wholly or partially, in which case he should provide to the
                    creditor written grounds of his rejection. We elaborate on this by stating our
                    view that the chairman’s decisions should not be peremptory. His duty to
                    give reasons puts the onus on him to look at each proof more carefully in the
                    proper exercise of his quasi-judicial function. This requirement also improves
                    the transparency of the voting process (see above at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>). Third, if the chairman has doubts whether a
                    proof should be admitted or rejected, he should mark it as objected to and allow
                    the creditor to vote subject to the vote being declared invalid in the event of
                    the objection being sustained. We should add that in coming to his decision, the
                    chairman may often require further evidence in support of a proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    A judicial manager’s (or his nominee
                    chairman’s) or a liquidator’s (or his nominee chairman’s)
                    decisions in respect of the admission or rejection of proofs of debt are subject
                    to appeal to the court. We see no reason why the position should be different
                    for the chairman of a s 210 creditors’ meeting when he admits or
                    rejects proofs for the purpose of voting. In particular, as we have suggested
                    above at <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>, in so far as the scheme
                    creditor is aggrieved by the potential diminution of its voting rights, it
                    plainly has good reason (at least as good as that of creditors voting on a
                    judicial manager’s proposals) to be allowed to appeal the chairman’s
                    decisions in respect of the admission or rejection of proofs of
                debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Further, for the same reason, we took the
                    view that a creditor who has submitted a proof to the chairman of a s 210
                    creditors’ meeting has the standing to challenge the chairman’s
                    decisions on the proofs of debt submitted by other creditors. This is
                    commonsensical as the chairman would otherwise have complete <em>carte blanche</em> to treat sympathetically proofs by supporting
                    creditors, without any possibility of any further audit of his decision.
                    However, such appeals to court should only be taken after the votes have been
                    counted and it can be seen whether the vote in question would affect the result
                    (see <em>Selim v McGrath</em> at [140]), preferably concurrently during the
                    sanction stage (see above at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    We turned next to the court’s approach
                    in hearing an appeal against a chairman’s admission or rejection of a
                    claim for the purpose of voting in a s 210 creditors’ meeting. We
                    ought to make clear from the outset that the court should be slow in overriding
                    the professional judgment of the chairman in admitting or rejecting proofs of
                    debt for the purpose of voting. Indeed, we accepted as correct the following
                    principles as stated in <em>Bacnet</em>, <em>viz</em>, that the court will not ordinarily interfere with the
                    chairman’s decisions based on his professional judgment unless it was
                    affected by bad faith, a mistake as to the facts, an erroneous approach to the
                    law or an error of principle (<em>Bacnet</em>
                        at [72]); and that the
                    court’s role is not to engage in its own valuation of a claim (<em>Bacnet</em> at [73]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Nonetheless, we were of the view that the
                    court has to be satisfied that the proposed scheme manager has acted on the
                    correct principles in his quasi-judicial role as chairman of a s 210
                    creditors’ meeting. If a proof of debt is not capable of substantiation
                    without the need for serious investigation or exertion, then the chairman should
                    at least make the necessary enquiries regarding the proof. This is especially so
                    if the proof of debt in question seeks to prove a substantial claim, as Ho
                    Lee’s proof does in the instant case (see <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a>–<a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Further, when deciding which proportion of a
                    creditor’s claim to admit (or to allow a creditor to vote, when his proof
                    is marked as objected to), the chairman need only make a “reasonable
                    estimate” (see Ian Fletcher, John Higham QC and William
                    Trower QC, <em>Corporate Administrations and Rescue
                        Procedures</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2004) at para 13.20)
                    or, put another way, a “just estimate” of the claim in question by
                    doing his best with the factual material the claimant furnishes, without
                    undertaking any detailed inquiry (see reg 5.6.23(2) of the Corporations
                    Regulations 2001 (Cth) and <em>Selim v McGrath</em>
                        at [103], endorsed in
                        <em>Bacnet</em> at [77]; note also that in the local context of a liquidation, a
                    “just estimate” must be made, so far as possible, of unascertained
                    claims: see s 327(1) of the Act). If it is impossible to ascribe any
                    sensible value to a claim, the chairman should attribute a nil value to it and
                    the claim should be rejected (see <em>Re UDL Holdings
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 1 HKLRD 156 (“<em>Re UDL
                        Holdings Ltd</em>”) at p 165J–166C, cited with
                    approval in <em>Bacnet</em> at [88]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    We should emphasise that up to now, we have
                    only been discussing the position regarding the chairman’s admission or
                    rejection of claims <em>for the purpose of voting</em> in a
                    s 210 creditors’ meeting. It must be made clear that even though the
                    court may order (on appeal by a creditor) that his claim be admitted or rejected
                    for the purpose of voting, this is in the nature of a “rough and
                    ready” determination keeping in mind that a vote on the proposed scheme
                    should not be delayed unnecessarily. Such an order does not bar the creditor
                    from going back to the court subsequently to seek determinative final
                    adjudication of the same claim on its merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    If the court determines that a
                    creditor’s claim was wrongly admitted or rejected for the purpose of
                    voting and the scheme would not have been approved but for that wrongful
                    admission or rejection, then the scheme must fail as the statutory supermajority
                    of three-fourths in value of the creditors has not been satisfied. Unpalatable
                    as this outcome may be to what could be the preponderance of creditors, the
                    court has no alternative but to give effect to the statutory
                conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Before such a final determination, however,
                    contrary to OCBC’s submission (see above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>), a disputed debt should be treated as being subject to the
                    scheme. If OCBC’s submission were correct, it might often require
                    supplemental schemes for the approval of main schemes and could significantly
                    increase the time taken, costs and complexities of securing approval for schemes
                    of arrangement. We did not accept OCBC’s submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the chairman’s decisions to admit or reject certain
                proofs of debt for the purpose of voting, in this case, were correct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Having determined that the decisions of the
                    proposed Scheme Manager (as chairman of the s 210 creditors’ meeting)
                    to admit or reject proofs are subject to appeal to this court, we then
                    considered certain of his decisions that were impugned by Ho Lee and
                    OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ho Lee’s contest over the partial rejection of its
                claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In CA 47, Ho Lee contested the proposed
                    Scheme Manager’s rejection of $61.79m of its $84.56m claim. The proposed
                    Scheme Manager had rejected these amounts on the basis that they were supported
                    by insufficient documentary evidence and the PwC report confirmed that such
                    rejection was reasonable. Ho Lee submitted that had the proposed Scheme Manager
                    consulted it or the SO, Jurong Consultants, he would have been provided with
                    explanations and evidence that would have justified the admissibility of Ho
                    Lee’s claims. Further, Ho Lee submitted that like the liquidator in
                        <em>Fustar</em>, the proposed Scheme Manager had
                    apparently gone out of his way to reject its claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The bulk of the $61.79m in claims that were

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a>(a)     the damages claim of $26,860,439;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a>(b)     the loss
                        of profits claim of $33,556,433.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In respect of the
                    damages claim, we noted that no claims of damages by suppliers or subcontractors
                    had been made against Ho Lee even until the date of the hearing of this
                        appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> Therefore, like the courts in <em>Re UDL Holdings Ltd</em> and <em>Bacnet</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>), we found that it was impossible to sensibly ascribe to
                    the proof the value claimed by Ho Lee. However, we agreed with Ho Lee that its
                    claim for loss of profits should have been admitted for a reasonable amount and
                    that the proposed Scheme Manager should have made basic enquiries before
                    rejecting its claim outright. For want of a more precise method of valuing that
                    claim, we ordered that Ho Lee’s claim for loss of profits be valued by
                    reference to the following objective criteria:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Take the average of Ho Lee’s profits (on a
                            percentage basis) in three of its largest contracts over the last two
                            years preceding the date of its Proof; and then</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Apply that average percentage profit to the value
                            of Ho Lee’s contract with the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(This claim should then be certified by Ho Lee’s auditors and
                        submitted to the Scheme Manager within 14 days from [27 August

                    Australia had only drawn down AUD$17.4m of the loan facility by the
                    Ascertainment Date, then it seemed that the Respondent could only have
                    guaranteed up to that amount by the Ascertainment Date. However, St George
                    Bank’s claim plainly exceeded what was drawn down by TEAC Australia by the
                    Ascertainment Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The portion of St George Bank’s
                    claim which exceeded the amount drawn down was dressed up as a contingent claim
                    and recognised as such by the Judge, together with the portion of the claim
                    which matched the amount drawn down by TEAC Australia by the Ascertainment Date.
                    The Judge admitted the whole of St George Bank’s claim on the basis
                    that clause 6.3 of the Scheme allowed creditors to lodge proofs of debt
                    which included the amounts of any contingent claims, and it was for the proposed
                    Scheme Manager to decide whether to admit such claims wholly or partially (see
                    the Judgment at [79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The Judge, however, did not address the
                    submission made to her by the Opposing Bank Creditors regarding how
                    St George Bank’s claim appeared to have far exceeded what had been
                    drawn down by TEAC Australia by the Ascertainment Date. In our view, the Judge
                    erred in not doing so, as, in our view, the definition of a “contingent
                    claim” under clause 6.3 of the Scheme did not include the sums of
                    money that had not been drawn down in respect of the loan facilities extended to
                    TEAC Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Although we did not have sight of the loan
                    and guarantee documents in respect of the loan facility which St George
                    Bank provided to TEAC Australia, it could not have been the case (especially
                    given the Group’s financial difficulties) that St George Bank was
                    bound to allow TEAC Australia to draw down on the remaining undrawn portions of
                    the loan facility after the Ascertainment Date. As at the Ascertainment Date,
                    St George Bank surely still had control over whether to maintain its credit
                    line to TEAC Australia. Counsel for the Respondent did not make a contrary
                    submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In our view, it would not have been right to
                    allow St George Bank to vote based on contingent claims (founded on the
                    undrawn credit facilities) which St George Bank could later unilaterally
                    ensure would never crystallise (by withdrawing those credit facilities).
                    Therefore, we ordered that only the amounts of the St George Bank credit
                    facilities which TEAC Australia had drawn down as of the Ascertainment Date be
                    admitted by the proposed Scheme Manager as claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ascendas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Our analysis pertaining to the claim by
                    St George Bank applied equally to the claim by Ascendas. Ascendas filed a
                    claim based on the Respondent’s corporate guarantee over a lease of 10 Toh
                    Guan Road to the Respondent’s subsidiary, Tradepark.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> The bulk of the claim of $53.8m
                    arose from future rents and was admitted in full. The breakdown of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Again, it was within Ascendas’ control
                    to terminate the lease once Tradepark defaulted on any payments. We doubted that
                    Ascendas was bound to lease 10 Toh Guan Road to Tradepark up till
                    4 March 2014, regardless of its receipt of dues under the lease. It seemed
                    to us that if Ascendas intended for the future rents to be admitted as claims
                    under the Scheme, Ascendas had to be bound to lease 10 Toh Guan Road to
                    Tradepark up to 4 March 2014, accepting as sufficient payment whatever
                    monies were accorded to it under the Scheme. It would have been commercially
                    unthinkable for Ascendas to have been content with that and, in fairness to
                    counsel for the Respondent, we ought to state that there was no suggestion that
                    this was the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In our view, it would also not have been
                    fair to allow Ascendas to vote based on contingent claims (founded on the future
                    lease payments) which it could later unilaterally ensure would never crystallise
                    (by terminating the lease). Therefore, we ordered that only the amounts of the
                    lease payments which Tradepark owed Ascendas (as of the Ascertainment Date)
                    should be admitted by the proposed Scheme Manager as claims. However, we also
                    ordered that that amount be reduced by the amount of the security deposit
                    provided by First Capital which had been utilised (as of the Ascertainment
                    Date). We explain why below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">First Capital</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    First Capital provided Ascendas a security
                    deposit of $6.86m in respect of the lease of 10 Toh Guan Road to Tradepark.
                    In return, the Respondent entered into an indemnity agreement with First
                    Capital. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> First
                    Capital’s claim of $6.86m was fully admitted by the
                        Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> OCBC and Ho Lee
                    submitted that that would have been double counting if Ascendas’ $53.8m
                    claim had not already factored in the $6.86m deposit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In other words, OCBC and Ho Lee submitted
                    that if the security deposit of $6.86m had been applied to Ascendas’
                    $53.8m claim so that First Capital’s claim could have been rightly
                    admitted as a contingent claim, then Ascendas’ claim should have been
                    reduced by $6.86m to give $46.94m. On the other hand, if First Capital’s
                    $6.86m deposit had not been utilised, then it did not have a valid contingent
                    claim of $6.86m against the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    On this issue, we ought to refer to the
                    English Divisional Court decision of <em>In re Sass</em>
                    [1896] 2 QB 12 (“<em>In re
                    Sass</em>”), where Vaughan Williams J (“Williams
                    J”) held (at 14–15) that a surety for part of a debt must
                    ordinarily pay that <em>entire</em> part before he can
                    stand in the shoes of the principal creditor and prove against the principal
                    debtor for that part of the debt. On that view, if only $3m of First
                    Capital’s $6.86m deposit had been utilised, First Capital would not have
                    been able to prove a $3m contingent claim against the Respondent (and Ascendas
                    would not have had to reduce its proof by the same amount). First Capital would
                    only have been able to prove any claim at all against the Respondent if the
                    entire $6.86m deposit had been utilised. The rule propounded by Williams J
                    above might seem odd but its rationale is explained in <em>Goode
                        on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</em> (Louise
                    Gullifer ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2008) ("<em>Goode</em>") as follows (at para 8-18):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At first sight it seems surprising that, if the surety pays part of the
                        debt the creditor should not have to give credit at least for sums received
                        from the surety prior to the bankruptcy. But the rule has a sound policy
                        base. <em>It is a well settled principle of equity that until
                            the creditor has received payment of the guaranteed debt in full the
                            surety cannot prove in the insolvent debtor’s estate for a sum
                            paid by him to the creditor, the reason being that he has, expressly or
                            by implication, undertaken to be responsible for the full sum
                            guaranteed, including whatever remains due to the creditor after receipt
                            of dividends by him out of the bankrupt’s estate, and thus has no
                            equity to prove for his right of reimbursement in competition with the
                            creditor. If the creditor were required to give credit for a
                            pre-bankruptcy part payment by the surety, neither of them could prove
                            for the amount of such payment and the general body of creditors would
                            thus be unjustly enriched.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    What is crucial to note is that Goode
                    recognises that an exception exists in the context of a landlord and tenant
                    situation: see <em>Milverton Group Ltd v Warner World
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 2 EGLR 28 (“<em>Milverton
                        Group</em>”). In that case, the English Court of Appeal decided
                    that the payment of rent by a surety discharged the lessee’s obligation to
                    pay the same rent. The reason for this was that both the tenant and the
                    guarantor owed “a single set of obligations” to pay the rent and
                    perform the covenants (<em>per</em> Hoffman LJ,
                    at 31). In the same vein, Glidewell LJ stated (at 30B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a lessor is entitled to be paid a sum by way of rent for a particular
                        period, and the original lessee, an assignee and a surety have all
                        covenanted to pay that rent, the lessor may recover it from any one of them
                        (in the case of the surety, if the assignee has defaulted). <em>If the lessor does however recover that sum from any one of the
                            three, the rent has then been paid. The other two persons who were
                            liable cease to be liable to pay that rent though of course they are
                            still liable for any future rent under their respective
                            covenants.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Therefore, since the lessee’s
                    obligation to pay the rent is discharged, the lessor may not prove against the
                    lessee (or its guarantor) and this leaves the surety to prove against the lessee
                    (or its guarantor) (<em>ie</em>, without contravening the
                    rule against double proof, since the surety does not prove in competition with
                    the lessor). To restate that in the context of the present case, since
                    Tradepark’s obligation to pay the rent is discharged, Ascendas may not
                    prove against Tradepark’s guarantor (the Respondent) and this leaves First
                    Capital to prove against the Respondent (presumably, First Capital would have
                    been able to prove against the Respondent as Tradepark’s guarantor of the
                    lease payments, but as it happened, First Capital proved against the Respondent
                    on the indemnity which the Respondent also provided).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Accordingly, in respect of First
                    Capital’s claim, we ordered that only the amount of the security deposit
                    (provided for Ascendas’ claim) which had been utilised as at the
                    Ascertainment Date should be admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Finally, we should add that OCBC and Ho Lee
                    both submitted that the claims of St George Bank, Ascendas and First
                    Capital were contingent and should have been classified differently for that
                    reason. We deal with these submissions below at <a href="#p1_142">[142]</a>–<a href="#p1_144">[144]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When should scheme creditors be classified differently for voting
                purposes in a s 210 scheme of arrangement?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on the classification of creditors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The classification of creditors has always
                    been problematic in this area of the law. In the oft-cited Hong Kong Court of
                    Final Appeal decision of <em>UDL Argos</em> (above,
                        at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>) at [27], Lord Millett NPJ
                    comprehensively distilled from a long line of authorities a set of principles
                    regarding the law on the classification of creditors. The principles most
                    relevant to the present case are reproduced here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    
              <em>Persons whose rights are so
                                dissimilar that they cannot sensibly consult together with a view to
                                their common interest must be given separate meetings.</em>
                            Persons whose rights are sufficiently similar that they can consult
                            together with a view to their common interest should be summoned to a
                            single meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    
              <em>The test is based on similarity
                                or dissimilarity of legal rights against the company, not on
                                similarity or dissimilarity of interests not derived from such legal
                                rights.</em> The fact that individuals may hold divergent
                            views based on their private interests not derived from their legal
                            rights against the company is not a ground for calling separate
                            meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The starting principle is simple enough:
                    those creditors whose rights are so dissimilar to each other’s that they
                    cannot sensibly consult together with a view to their common interest must vote
                    in different classes (“the dissimilarity principle”). However, in
                    considering whether the legal rights of creditors against the company are
                    similar or dissimilar, exactly which legal rights are to be compared and in what
                    situations? The law has been further elaborated upon in three other cases:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    
          <em>Re Telewest</em>
                    concerned two applications under the UK s 425(1) for leave to convene
                    creditors’ meetings. The proposed scheme in <em>Re
                        Telewest</em> provided that sterling claims were to be converted into
                    US dollars in accordance with a formula known as the average exchange rate. A
                    subsequent decline in the value of the US dollar against sterling caused
                    sterling bondholders to be concerned that the “average exchange
                    rate”, as against a spot rate on the date on which scheme claims were
                    valued, produced seriously unfavourable treatment of the sterling bondholders as
                    against the US dollar bondholders. They submitted that if the scheme were
                    permitted to proceed in its present form, the sterling bondholders of Telewest
                    Communications plc (“Telewest”) should vote in a separate class.
                    In coming to his decision, David Richards J
                    (“Richards J”) stated the following principles
                        (at [28]–[30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    ... <b><em>The purpose of most schemes
                                of arrangement with creditors is to produce an arrangement which
                                differs from an insolvent liquidation. If the differences apply
                                equally to all creditors, no question of separate classes
                                arises.</em></b> So, for example, in this case, the cancellation
                            of the bonds for equity in the new holding company is radically
                            different from the result of a liquidation which would involve a
                            realisation and distribution of Telewest's assets, but it applies to all
                            bondholders and raises no class issue. <em>However, it is
                                submitted that if the difference from the template of rights in a
                                liquidation produces a result which differs in its impact on one
                                group of creditors as against another, then subject to questions of
                                materiality they will form separate classes for the purposes of the
                                scheme. …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    There is no dispute that, in the circumstances of a
                            case like the present, <em>the relevant rights of
                                creditors to be compared against the terms of the scheme are those
                                which arise in an insolvent liquidation.
                        …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    The working of this principle is illustrated by two
                            cases. In <em>Re Richards &amp; Co</em>
                            (1879) LR 11 Ch D 676 <em>the court
                                refused to sanction a scheme because it treated a creditor with
                                preferential rights in a liquidation as an ordinary unsecured
                                creditor.</em> ... The same principle underlies the decision
                            of the Court of Appeal in [<em>Re Hawk
                                Insurance</em>]. Policyholders with present, future and
                            contingent claims were combined in one class. <em>Outside
                                a liquidation their rights were different, but in a liquidation they
                                enjoyed the same right to participate</em> pari passu
                                <em>in the distribution of the company's assets, with
                                a just estimate being made of the future and contingent liabilities.
                                Because their rights were to be judged against their position in an
                                insolvent liquidation and because the scheme gave effect to those
                                rights, they were correctly included in a single class.</em>
                            See in particular paragraphs 34 and 40–44 of the judgment of
                            Chadwick LJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Thus, the relevant comparison in <em>Re Telewest</em> was between the relative rights of creditors
                    (among each other) under the scheme and their relative rights (among each other)
                    in the alternative scenario that faced the company, liquidation. To be clear,
                    creditors will not be considered dissimilar just because they are treated
                    differently by the scheme. Indeed, schemes may prefer certain creditors just as
                    liquidation outcomes might. However, if the scheme favours or prejudices a group
                    of creditors (against other creditors) differently from how they would be
                    favoured or prejudiced in a liquidation, such as to give them an additional
                    non-private interest to vote for or against the scheme (which would make it
                    impossible for them to consult the other creditors with a view to their common
                    interest), then that group of creditors should be classed
                separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Applying the aforesaid principles,
                    Richards J held (at [40]) that
                    there was a great deal more which united the bondholders of Telewest than
                    divided them; and that the scheme appeared to be a single arrangement with all
                    bondholders rather than separate but linked arrangements with the sterling and
                    US dollar bondholders. Richards J also noted (at [47]) that the consensus arrived by the
                    bondholders committee (comprising members with diverse holdings of dollar and
                    sterling bonds) suggested “that the dissimilarity in their positions
                    [wa]s not so great as to require separate class meetings.” He accordingly
                    rejected (at [48]) the sterling
                    bondholders’ submission that that the sterling and US dollar bondholders
                    constitute separate classes for the purpose of the Telewest
                scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In <em>Re Telewest
                        Communications plc</em>, the English Court of Appeal refused the
                    sterling bondholders’ application for permission to appeal against
                    Richard J’s decision on the basis that the appeal did not have any
                    real prospect of success (at [15]).
                    It further affirmed Richards J’s decision on the basis that he had
                    applied the correct principles (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am satisfied from the passages which I have quoted from the judgment
                        that there was no misdirection or error of law on the part of David
                        Richards J. <em>He applied the correct principles in
                            deciding whether or not there should be a single meeting of scheme
                            creditors or two separate meetings.</em> It is a decision with
                        which this court should not lightly interfere. <em>It is made
                            by a judge who has very great experience of this kind of application. It
                            is also made on the basis of, in my view, very convincing reasoning as
                            to the law laid down in the</em> Practice Statement <em>and in the authorities (principally [Re Hawk Insurance]), and
                            on the material before him.</em> I would not interfere with a
                        judgment on such an issue unless I was satisfied that there had been an
                        error of principle. <em>There has been no error of
                            principle.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Next, in <em>Re Hawk
                        Insurance</em>, the scheme had a special formula for claims arising
                    from insurance and re-insurance contracts. Payments to the creditors were to be
                    calculated by reference to 100% of the proportion of the claim attributable to
                    unsettled paid claims, 75% of the proportion attributable to outstanding losses
                    and 50% of the proportion attributable to losses incurred but not reported
                    (“IBNR”). The scheme was an alternative to winding up, in which a
                    just estimate would be made in respect of the claims for outstanding losses and
                    IBNR claims which had elements of contingency and futurity and were of uncertain
                    quantum (see <em>Re Hawk Insurance</em> at [47]–[48] and [50]. Notably,
                    the scheme provided for the different percentages mentioned above to make a
                    corresponding “rough and ready” just estimate of those claims see
                        <em>Re Hawk Insurance</em> at [50].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In his analysis, Chadwick LJ explained
                    why the rights of the non-contingent creditors (on the one hand) and the
                    contingent creditors (on the other hand) were the same (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that (but for any special rules applicable to the valuation of
                        claims under insurance policies) <em>the rights of
                            non-insurance creditors, insurance creditors with unsettled paid claims,
                            insurance creditors with outstanding losses and insurance creditors with
                            IBNR losses are the same in this respect: that in the context of a
                            winding up of the company they will all be entitled to submit claims in
                            the winding up and to have those claims admitted or rejected.
                            </em><b><em>The difference between the position of
                            non-insurance creditors and insurance creditors with unsettled paid
                            claims (on the one hand) and insurance creditors with outstanding losses
                            or IBNR losses (on the other hand) is that</em></b>,<b><em>in the case of the latter, their claims are in respect of
                            debts which by reason their ‘being subject to any contingency or
                            for any other reason’ do not bear a certain value and so must be
                            the subject of an estimate. But that does not lead to the conclusion
                            that the rights of, say, non-insurance creditors and insurance creditors
                            with IBNR losses are different. They have the same rights in a winding
                            up.</em></b> It is simply that, in order to give effect to the rights
                        of the creditors with IBNR losses, it is necessary to estimate their value.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In other words, the scheme provided for
                    estimation formulae which sought to mirror the relative rights of the creditors
                    as they stood in a winding up. The scheme did not alter the relative rights of
                    the contingent and non-contingent creditors so that the contingent creditors
                    would be better or worse off than they would be (relative to the non-contingent
                    creditors) if a winding up occurred. If, to the contrary, the relative rights
                    (among creditors) of the contingent creditors were better according to the
                    scheme than in a winding up situation, the contingent creditors would have an
                    additional interest to vote for the scheme. This additional non-private interest
                    derived from their rights under the scheme would make it impossible for them to
                    consult the non-contingent creditors with a view to their common interest. On
                    the other hand, if the relative rights (among creditors) of the contingent
                    creditors were worse according to the scheme than in a winding up situation,
                    their additional non-private interest to vote against the scheme would also make
                    it impossible for them to consult the non-contingent creditors. In both
                    situations, the contingent creditors should therefore be classed
                    separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In <em>Re Hawk
                        Insurance</em>, however, the scheme crystallised the claims of the
                    contingent creditors in a way that sought (<em>via</em>
                    “rough and ready” just estimates) to pay the contingent creditors
                    according to what they would have received in a winding up. Thus, the contingent
                    creditors had no additional non-private interests (over non-contingent
                    creditors) pursuant to the scheme to vote for or against the scheme. Hence, the
                    English Court of Appeal held that no separate classification was
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Therefore, the dissimilarity principle (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_131">[131]</a>) means that if a
                    creditor’s (or a group of creditors’) position will improve or
                    decline to such a different extent <em>vis-à-vis</em> other
                    creditors simply because of the terms of the scheme (and not because of its own
                    unique circumstances, <em>ie</em>, its “private
                    interests”) assessed against the most likely scenario in the absence of
                    scheme approval (“the appropriate comparator”), then it should be
                    placed in a different voting class from the other creditors. We should highlight
                    here that the appropriate comparator depends on the facts of each case and is
                    not necessarily an insolvent liquidation. For example, in <em>Re
                        The British Aviation Insurance Co Ltd</em> [2006] 1 BCLC 665
                        (“<em>British Aviation</em>”), the
                    company proposing the scheme was solvent and therefore the appropriate
                    comparator there was a continuing solvent run-off (see [88] of <em>British
                        Aviation</em>). Another interesting example is found in the case of
                        <em>Re T&amp;N and others (No 3)</em> [2007]
                    1 All ER 851 (“<em>T&amp;N
                        Limited</em>”), where the proposed scheme arose from settlement
                    discussions in the context of disputed asbestos-related claims against
                    employers’ liability insurers (see <em>T&amp;N
                        Limited</em> at [6]–[7]). There,
                    the appropriate comparator was continued litigation regarding the disputed
                    claims and the uncertainty accompanying it (see <em>T&amp;N
                        Limited</em> at [88] and
                        [99]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Ultimately, the classification of creditors
                    for the purposes of voting is protective of minority creditors whose rights
                    might be crammed down upon if they are outvoted. By allowing them to vote
                    separately from creditors whose rights are so different from them such that the
                    latter have additional non-private interests in voting for the scheme, these
                    minority creditors are less likely to be overwhelmed and their votes are given
                    the appropriate significance. The application of the dissimilarity principle to
                    complex transactions and situations where there are different levels of secured
                    and unsecured creditors, as well as intra-creditor relationships, is not without
                    its difficulties. Defining a “legal right” in these contexts can
                    be thorny. <em>The courts have therefore to take a broad,
                        practical and objective approach in analysing creditor relationships and
                        ensure that the application of this principle does not lead to an
                        impractical mushrooming of classes that could potentially result in the
                        creation of unjustified minority vetoes.</em> An overly legalistic
                    approach might inhibit the usage of schemes as a practical alternative to other
                    insolvency measures with more extreme consequences for creditors as a
                    whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contingent claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    As stated above at <a href="#p1_129">[129]</a>, OCBC and Ho Lee submitted that the claims
                    of St George Bank, Ascendas and First Capital were contingent claims and
                    ought to have been classified separately. In the present case, the appropriate
                    comparator was an insolvent liquidation. Without the Scheme, the liquidator
                    would distribute the contingent claimants a portion of the Respondent’s
                    assets (on a <em>pari </em><em>passu</em> basis) based on the “just estimate” (see
                    s 327(1) of the Act) of their contingent claims. Under the Scheme, the
                    contingent claimants would be able to claim under the terms of the Scheme
                        (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>–<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) if their claims crystallised within
                    five years of the Scheme’s effective date. It appeared to us that if
                    St George Bank’s, Ascendas’ and First Capital’s
                    contingent claims on the Respondent’s guarantees or indemnities were to
                    crystallise, there was no reason why they would not crystallise within five
                    years of the Scheme’s effective date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Put another way, the creditors would receive
                    in an insolvent liquidation an amount based on the “just estimate”
                    of a claim that would crystallise later under the Scheme (provided the claim
                    crystallised within five years, which did not appear unlikely). In our view, the
                    contingent creditors’ legal rights as against the Respondent (and relative
                    to the other creditors) were the same under the Scheme as they were in an
                    insolvent liquidation. Therefore, it seemed to us that these contingent
                    creditors would assess the Scheme primarily based on its effectiveness in
                    preserving the Respondent’s economic value (so as to satisfy their
                    claims), as the rest of the creditors in the general class of unsecured
                    creditors would. In that light, we saw no reason to classify those contingent
                    creditors separately. It cannot be overlooked that the separate classification
                    of any group of creditors allows that group a minority veto and courts must be
                    careful not to allow the test for classification to become “an instrument
                    of oppression by a minority” (see <em>Re Hawk
                        Insurance</em> at [33]).
                    Nevertheless, there appeared to be good reason to discount the votes of the
                    contingent creditors in this case, which we elaborate on at <a href="#p1_172">[172]</a>–<a href="#p1_178">[178]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    At this point, we wish to express our doubts
                    regarding one of the cases cited to us by OCBC and Ho Lee, <em>ie</em>, <em>Re Econ Corp Ltd</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 273, where the High Court took the view (at [82]) that the contingent creditors in that
                    case should have been separately classed for voting purposes. The court’s
                    brief reasoning merely stated that the rights of the contingent creditors would
                    not arise until calls were made on the performance bonds issued by them. This
                    seemed to merely restate the contingent nature of the said creditors’
                    claims. In our view, the proper approach would have been to compare the
                    contingent creditors’ rights under the proposed scheme against the
                    appropriate comparator, as discussed above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The subordinated claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    There were a number of admitted claims by
                    substantial shareholders which pertained to unpaid dividends declared by the
                    Respondent on 30 October 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> These amounted to around $0.72m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to
                        s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Act, these claims
                    constituted deferred debts in the order of distribution of assets in the course
                    of liquidation. The Judge held that s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) was not relevant as the company was not being wound up (see
                    the Judgment at [53]). The Judge
                    also distinguished the case of <em>Soden v British &amp;
                        Commonwealth Holdings Plc</em> [1998] AC 298 at 324 on
                    the basis that “[t]he features of the Scheme on the present facts made it
                    clear that the [Respondent’s] assets were not to be distributed on the
                    same basis as if the company was in liquidation.” (See the Judgment
                        at [52]) With respect to the
                    Judge, it was precisely the fact that the Respondent’s assets were to be
                    distributed on a different basis under the scheme in contrast to a liquidation
                    which should have prompted scrutiny to determine whether the different basis
                    would call for the differential classification of certain
                creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In our view, the Judge erred in holding that
                        s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) was not relevant as the
                    company was not being wound up. The rights of the creditors in a winding up (as
                    subordinated under s 250(1)(<em>g</em>)) are certainly
                    relevant notwithstanding that the Respondent is not being wound up now. In
                    particular, they are relevant because as in <em>Re
                        Telewest</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a>–<a href="#p1_135">[135]</a>),
                    insolvent liquidation appears to be the only realistic alternative to the Scheme
                    (see <em>Re The British Aviation Insurance Co Ltd</em>
                    [2006] BCC 14 at [88]). This is
                    evidenced by the comparison of the projected returns to creditors under the
                    Scheme to that in a liquidation scenario in the “Recommendations”
                    section of the Explanatory Statement to the Scheme, which recommended the Scheme
                    as a better alternative.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The cases of <em>Re
                        Telewest</em>, <em>Re Hawk Insurance</em> and
                        <em>Wah Yuen</em> discussed above (at <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a>–<a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>) lend support to our view that the classification of
                    creditors requires the consideration of whether the scheme altered the relative
                    rights of the different creditors so that the creditors in question would be
                    better or worse off (relative to other creditors) under the scheme than they
                    would be (relative to other creditors) in a winding up situation in this matter.
                    Here, although the substantial shareholders’ claims would be subordinated
                    in a liquidation pursuant to s 250(1)(<em>g</em>),
                    their claims would not be subordinated (and thus, more advantageously dealt
                    with) under the Scheme. Their rights were thus so dissimilar from those of the
                    general class of unsecured Scheme Creditors (due to this additional non-private
                    interest to vote for the Scheme) that it was plainly necessary for them to be
                    classified separately for the purposes of voting. We so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Rights of First Refusal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Under the Scheme, Mr Sng and
                    Ms Tong are granted ROFRs to the RCBs and the shares they are converted
                        into.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Explanatory Statement, Mr Sng and Ms Tong play a critical role in the
                    Group’s businesses and operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span>
                    Their continued involvement in the Respondent was said to be significant in
                    ensuring the support of the Group’s key creditors for the Scheme and the
                    Scheme’s success.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>
                    The ROFRs were thus granted to address the concern that if a significant part of
                    the Non-Sustainable Debt were converted to equity under the Scheme, Mr Sng
                    and Ms Tong’s interests in the Respondent would be significantly
                    diluted, in turn causing creditors and investors to lose confidence in the
                        Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The ROFRs mean that before a Scheme Creditor
                    can sell its RCBs or the shares converted from the RCBs, it must first offer
                    them to Mr Sng and Ms Tong. In particular, the shares have to be
                    offered to Mr Sng and Ms Tong at prices arrived at through formulae
                    which prefer their interests. These ROFRs, non-existent in a liquidation
                    scenario but unique to Mr Sng and Ms Tong under the Scheme, improved
                    their position relative to other Scheme Creditors <em>vis-à-vis</em> a liquidation scenario. With respect to the Judge, the
                    ROFRs did not merely give Mr Sng and Ms Tong “an additional
                    private interest in supporting the vote” (see the Judgment
                        at [48]). In our view, the
                    ROFRs were additional legal rights under the Scheme which gave them non-private
                    interests in supporting the vote. We also do not think it mattered that
                    “that interest [wa]s not derived from their legal rights as shareholders
                    claiming unpaid dividends from the Respondent”; neither did it matter
                    that Sng and Tong had voluntarily waived 50% of the dividends due and payable to
                    them (see the Judgment at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Therefore, we held that the ROFRs gave
                    Mr Sng and Ms Tong additional non-private interests to vote for the
                    Scheme. Mr Sng’s and Ms Tong’s rights against the
                    Respondent were thus so dissimilar from those of the other Scheme Creditors that
                    they had to be classified differently for the purposes of voting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    However, we made clear to the parties that
                    Ms Tong was free to vote as a related creditor (see <a href="#p1_170">[170]</a>–<a href="#p1_171">[171]</a> below) if she relinquished her ROFRs, save that any claim
                    of hers which fell within the preceding category of subordinated claims was to
                    be excluded (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>).
                    Mr Sng, on the other hand, had to be excluded from the general class of
                    unsecured Scheme Creditors even if he relinquished his ROFRs because his entire
                    claim fell within the preceding category of subordinated claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When scheme creditors should have their votes discounted</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Related creditors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In <em>UDL Argos</em>
                        at [27] (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> and <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>), Lord Millett NPJ set out a key
                    overriding principle regarding the treatment of votes by related party
                    creditors. It is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    The Court will decline to sanction a Scheme unless
                            it is satisfied, not only that the meetings were properly constituted
                            and that the proposals were approved by the requisite majorities, but
                            that the result of each meeting fairly reflected the views of the
                            creditors concerned. <em>To this end it may discount or
                                disregard altogether the votes of those who, though entitled to vote
                                at a meeting as a member of the class concerned, have such personal
                                or special interests in supporting the proposals that their views
                                cannot be regarded as fairly representative of the class in
                                question.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In <em>Wah Yuen</em>,
                    this court adopted Lord Millett NPJ’s view (at [27(3)] of
                        <em>UDL Argos</em>, see <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a> above) that related party creditors do not have to vote as
                    a separate class simply because they are related creditors. This court held
                        (<em>Wah Yuen</em> at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Counsel for Wah Yuen correctly submitted that related
                            party creditors did not constitute a separate class of creditors for
                            voting purposes simply because they were related parties.</em>
                        This is because “the test is based on similarity or dissimilarity of
                        legal rights against the company, not on similarity or dissimilarity of
                        interests not derived from such legal rights. The fact that individuals may
                        hold divergent views based on their private interests not derived from their
                        legal rights against the company is not a ground for calling separate
                        meetings”: <em>UDL Argos Engineering &amp; Heavy
                            Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    However, this court went on to observe
                        (at [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although related party votes are counted for purposes of determining
                        whether the statutory majority has been reached, <b><em>the
                            courts have consistently attributed less weight to such votes when asked
                            to exercise their discretion in favour of a scheme</em></b><em>. This is because the related party may have been motivated by
                            personal or special interests to disregard the interests of the class as
                            such and vote in a self-centred manner.</em> In the present case,
                        we found no reason to abandon our traditional reserve because Wah Yuen's
                        continued reticence on the related party debts prevented the court from
                        making a competent assessment of the bona fides of the related party votes.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Taken together, the authorities say with one
                    voice that it is the norm for the votes of related party creditors to be
                    discounted in light of their special interests to support a proposed scheme by
                    virtue of their relationship to the company. The Judge in fact noted
                        at [47] of her Judgment that
                    she was “entitled to attach less weight to [the related parties’]
                    views in [her] overall decision whether to approve the Scheme because of their
                    special interest in the [Respondent] and the Scheme”, but she did not do
                    this in making her final decision. In our view, she erred here as there was no
                    reason to depart from the norm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Wholly owned subsidiaries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The ensuing question, then, was the extent
                    to which each related party creditor’s vote should be discounted. This was
                    the list of related party creditors which the Judge had set out
                        at [43] of her Judgment.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    From the Respondent’s annual report
                    for the financial year ending 2009, we noted that most of the related party
                    creditors were in fact wholly owned subsidiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> In fact,
                    on the list in the preceding paragraph, only KBC Bank NV Singapore Branch
                    (“KBC Bank”), Ms Tong and the substantial shareholders
                    (referring to creditors with subordinated claims under s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Act which we dealt with earlier
                        at <a href="#p1_145">[145]</a>–<a href="#p1_147">[147]</a> above) were not wholly owned
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In our view, the votes of wholly owned
                    subsidiaries should be discounted to zero. Wholly owned subsidiaries are
                    entirely controlled by their parent company <em>ie</em>,
                    the Respondent in this case. Indeed, we view the Respondent’s wholly owned
                    subsidiaries as extensions of the Respondent itself. If the Respondent were to
                    wind up any of its wholly owned subsidiary creditors, the debts owing to those
                    wholly owned subsidiary creditors (save for those debts owed by the wholly owned
                    subsidiary creditors to genuine third party creditors) would be extinguished and
                    the assets of the wholly owned subsidiary creditors would be the
                    Respondent’s. Significantly, the votes of the wholly owned subsidiary
                    creditors at creditors’ meetings are undoubtedly entirely controlled by
                    the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Our view in assessing the proofs of wholly
                    owned subsidiary companies is in line with the approach adopted in the Supreme
                    Court of New South Wales decision of <em>Re Landmark Corporation
                        Ltd</em> [1968] 1 NSWR 759.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> In that case, Street J was
                    faced with a petition to approve a scheme of arrangement for a company called
                    Landmark Corporation Ltd (“Landmark”). At the court-convened
                    meeting, votes in favour of the scheme were cast by creditors to whom Landmark
                    owed AUD$2,506,984, but this amount included AUD$1,526,097 which was owed to
                    seven of Landmark’s wholly-owned subsidiaries or
                sub-subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Street J held (at 766) that these
                    creditors were correctly admitted to vote in the class of unsecured creditors
                    and that the statutory majority was obtained so that he had jurisdiction to
                    approve the scheme. However, he had remarked (at 765) that “[t]heir
                    votes accordingly must be regarded as cast with due deference to the wishes of
                    [Landmark].” He went on to elaborate (at 767) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The associated companies whose claims amount to [AUD]$1,526,097 were, as I
                        have already stated, voting in favour of the scheme at a point of time when
                        their affairs were wholly controlled by their parent company, there being no
                        receiver or liquidator or external control in any of these associated
                        companies. <em>It is difficult to attribute to the management
                            of these associated companies any motive which would differ from the
                            motive of [Landmark] itself. </em><b><em>I am of the
                            view that their votes could have little, if any, weight when using the
                            voting at the meeting as having probative force in establishing what is
                            best in the interests of the class of ordinary unsecured creditors.
                            </em></b><em>It would be rare in circumstances such as
                            these for a wholly-owned subsidiary, whilst still entirely within the
                            control of its parent, to be permitted to have any significant weight
                            attached to its vote at a meeting under s. 181.</em> Whilst
                        in law the entities are separate, <b><em>when it comes to
                            exercising discretion under s. 181 the Court is concerned with the
                            reality of the situation, and I cannot regard the votes of the
                            associated companies as indicative of the wishes of members of the class
                            of unsecured creditors in respect of what is best to be done in the
                            interests of that class. </em></b><b><em>These claims
                            totalling [AUD]$1,526,097 will carry little weight.</em></b> [emphasis
                        added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Street J went on to consider that of
                    the external creditors who voted, those who voted against the scheme were owed
                    AUD$456,000 while those who supported the scheme were owed only AUD$93,000
                    (which he arrived at after deducting, for other reasons, certain other sums from
                    the difference between AUD$2,506,984 and AUD$1,526,097). He noted (at 767)
                    that he had to “be slow to differ from so clear a guide as to what the
                    external creditors themselves regard as best in the interests of their
                    class.” In the prevailing circumstances, Street J decided not to
                    approve the scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Street J effectively weighted the votes
                    of Landmark’s wholly owned subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries to zero. We
                    think that this was right. In this matter, we likewise considered it correct to
                    exclude the Respondent’s wholly owned subsidiaries from the general class
                    of unsecured Scheme Creditors and directed that they vote with the Scheme
                    Creditors whose claims would be subordinated in a liquidation pursuant to
                        s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Act (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_147">[147]</a>). We were of the view
                    that this was a clearer and fairer treatment of the wholly owned subsidiaries,
                    notwithstanding that technically, they did not appear to have different legal
                    rights as against the Respondent than those enjoyed by the general class of
                    unsecured Scheme Creditors (<em>cf</em> the test for the
                    classification of creditors at <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>–<a href="#p1_131">[131]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    We are aware that this might not be the
                    approach invariably adopted in England. In that regard, it is worthwhile to
                    begin by considering the case of <em>In re Hellenic &amp; General
                        Trust Ltd</em> [1976] 1 WLR 123 (“<em>re Hellenic</em>”), where a scheme of arrangement was used to
                    effect a take-over. The scheme provided that the intending acquirer
                    (“H”), would pay 48 pence per share to the company’s former
                    shareholders for their shares to be cancelled, and that fully paid shares would
                    be issued to H. A wholly-owned subsidiary of H (“M”), already
                    owned more than 50% of the company’s shares. The Scheme was approved at a
                    single meeting of members by the requisite majority, with the help of M's votes.
                    Templeman J refused to sanction the scheme, holding that the court had no
                    jurisdiction to sanction the scheme because M constituted a different class from
                    the remaining shareholders. Our approach in the present case is much akin to
                    Templeman J’s, notwithstanding that the wholly owned subsidiaries in
                    the present case are those of the Respondent (the company), while M in <em>re Hellenic</em> was a wholly owned subsidiary of an
                    intending acquirer. In both cases, the subsidiaries were wholly owned by the
                    proponent of the respective schemes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Crucially, it must be noted that the legal
                    rights of M and the remaining shareholders were identical as against the
                    company, while the test for the differential classification of creditors is
                    based on different legal rights as against the company (see <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>–<a href="#p1_131">[131]</a> above). In <em>Re BTR Plc</em> [1999]
                    2 BCLC 675 at 682, to reconcile <em>re
                        Hellenic</em>, Jonathan Parker J (“Parker J”)
                    has suggested that the true <em>ratio</em> of that case was
                    that M’s views were effectively discounted since, in substance, the scheme
                    only affected the shares which did not belong to M (see <em>Re
                        BTR Plc</em> [1999] 2 BCLC 675 at 682). We note that in
                    denying leave to appeal against Parker J’s decision, the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>Re BTR Plc</em> [2000]
                    1 BCLC 740 was consistent with Parker J’s
                suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Therefore, it seems that the English courts
                    might be inclined towards keeping to Street J’s method of discounting
                    entirely the votes of wholly owned subsidiaries (if only in order to keep true
                    to the principle that creditors may be classified differently solely on the
                    basis of different legal rights as against the company). However, we are of the
                    view that our approach of simply classifying wholly owned subsidiaries
                    separately is defensible as a worthwhile exception to the general rule as it
                    commends itself as more straightforward. We also note that in <em>UDL Argos</em>, Lord Millett NPJ rationalised <em>re Hellenic</em> on the basis that, in the commercial
                    circumstances which obtained, M’s legal rights were <em>commercially</em> so dissimilar from those of the other shareholders
                    that it was impossible for M to consult with them (at [22]–[23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    The case was relied on by the present appellants
                            as showing that separate meetings should have been held because the
                            shareholders had conflicting interests rather than different rights,
                                <em>and it is true that Templeman J consistently
                                referred to the parties' respective “interests” rather
                                than their “rights”. But it is important not to be
                                distracted by mere terminology.</em> Judges frequently use
                            imprecise language when precision is not material to the question to be
                            decided, and in many contexts the words “interests” and
                            “rights” are interchangeable. <em>The key
                                to the decision is that M was effectively identified with H. It
                                would plainly have been inappropriate to include M in the same class
                                as the other shareholders if it had been buying their shares; it
                                should not make a difference that the purchaser was its parent
                                company.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    But this was not because M and the other
                            shareholders had conflicting interests, nor because they had different
                            rights to start with. <em>M's legal rights at the outset
                                were the same as those of the other shareholders. What put M into a
                                different category from the other shareholders was the different
                                treatment it was to receive under the Scheme.</em> The other
                            shareholders were being bought out. <b><em>In commercial
                                terms M was transferring its shares to its own parent company and
                                obtaining for its parent company the right to acquire the remainder
                                of the shares from the other shareholders. The rights proposed to be
                                conferred by the Scheme on M and the other shareholders were
                                commercially so dissimilar as to make it impossible for M and the
                                other shareholders to consult together with a view to their common
                                interest, for they had none.</em></b></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Finally, we should add that our decision in
                    the present case on this point is limited to the treatment of wholly owned
                    subsidiaries. The treatment of partially owned subsidiaries also raises
                    difficult issues, but we leave them to be addressed in a more appropriate
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Akira Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    There was one wholly owned subsidiary,
                    however, which we did not allow any voting rights at all. This was Akira Pte
                    Ltd. The debt which the Respondent owed to Akira Pte Ltd increased remarkably
                    from $5.155m as at 31 March 2009 to $86.97m as at the Ascertainment

                    weeks before the last day for the Respondent to hold the Further Meetings
                    – see above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>), KPMG reported
                    that according to the senior management of the Respondent, the license and
                    distribution agreements were made between the Respondent and Akira Pte Ltd in
                    conjunction with the Group’s strategy to spin off the AKIRA business into
                    Akira Pte Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Akira Pte Ltd, in turn, was intended to
                    be injected into a listed company by way of a Reverse Take Over
                        (“RTO”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span>
                    The license and distribution agreements were executed in order to ensure that
                    all such transactions between the company and its subsidiaries were conducted at
                    arm’s length.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> The RTO did not
                        materialise<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> but the license and
                    distribution agreements remained in place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    We noted that there were never any billings
                    by Akira Pte Ltd to the Respondent under the license and distribution agreements
                    (and consequently no indication in the Respondent’s financial statements
                    of the existence of these agreements) up till the filing of Akira Pte
                    Ltd’s proof of debt. This caused us to doubt that the Respondent intended
                    for the license and distribution agreements to bind itself, which in turn cast
                    doubt on the admissibility of claims founded on those agreements. It seemed to
                    us that these agreements did not reflect an arm’s length relationship
                    between Akira and the Respondent. On a cynical view, which might not be far from
                    the truth, they appear to have been dug up and dusted off purely to strengthen
                    the Respondent’s hand in the proposed Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Tong and KBC Bank</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Ms Tong was a related party creditor in
                    respect of her shareholder’s loan to the Respondent as she was a
                    shareholder of the Respondent (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> and <a href="#p1_151">[151]</a>). KBC Bank
                    was a related party creditor because the banking facilities which it provided to
                    the Respondent were secured by shares in the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> In our view,
                    the sensible approach was to allow Ms Tong (if she chose to relinquish her
                    ROFRs – see <a href="#p1_151">[151]</a> above) and KBC Bank
                    to vote in the general class of unsecured Scheme Creditors but discount their
                    respective votes by the value of the Respondent’s shares that was owned
                    (in Ms Tong’s case) or that was used to secure the claim (in KBC
                    Bank’s case) as of the Ascertainment Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Therefore, we made the following order (with
                    accompanying footnotes) (see Annexure I at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If Ms Tong chooses to vote as a related creditor, her
                        vote should be discounted by the value (as of 31 July 2009) of the
                        shareholding she has in the Respondent.<sup>17</sup>
                        Similarly, KBC Bank NV’s vote should be discounted by the value (as of
                        31 July 2009) of the Respondent’s shareholding that secures the
                        banking facilities which KBC Bank NV has
                            provided.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<sup>17 </sup>For example, if Ms Tong has an
                            admitted claim of $10 (none of which is a “Subordinated
                            claim” as above) but holds shares in the Respondent worth at the
                            Ascertainment Date $6, then she should only be allowed to vote $4 of her
                            claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<sup>18</sup> For example, if KBC Bank NV has an
                            admitted claim of $10 but its banking facilities provided to the
                            Respondent are secured by the Respondent’s shares worth at the
                            Ascertainment Date $6, then KBC Bank NV should only be allowed to vote
                            $4 of its claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contingent creditors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Although we did not order that the votes of
                    the contingent creditors be discounted for the Further Meeting of the general
                    body of unsecured creditors, on hindsight, we should perhaps have done so. In
                    our view, a contingent creditor should not be allowed to vote the full amount of
                    his contingent claim as if it had actually been proven. Generally speaking, a
                    creditor with a contingent claim of $10m (with a 80% chance of crystallisation
                    within five years of the scheme’s effective date ) should only be allowed
                    to vote with 80% of the voting weight given to a creditor with an actual claim
                    of $10m that had crystallised by the ascertainment date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    We agree with the approach taken in
                        <em>Re Hawk Insurance</em> on this issue. There, the
                    proposed scheme admitted the three different categories of claims in full but
                    paid out only proportions of the fully admitted claims according to just
                    estimates of their values in a winding up (see above at <a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>–<a href="#p1_139">[139]</a>). Notably, Chadwick LJ expressed his view
                        (at [51]) that he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... would have thought it more appropriate for the scheme to provide for
                        the differential weighting of claims <em>at the stage of
                            valuation and admission</em>–rather than in the course of
                        distribution ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While Chadwick LJ did not insist upon that view given that it
                    would have made no practical difference in that case (see <em>Re
                        Hawk Insurance</em> at [51]), we think that it is an important principle to be stated
                    here for application in future cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    We should add our opinion that it makes no
                    difference that the scheme in <em>Re Hawk Insurance</em>
                    was a cut-off scheme which crystallised contingent claims upon its sanction,
                    while the present Scheme allows contingent claims to crystallise within five
                    years. The point is that contingent claimants should generally vote according to
                    the likelihood of their claims crystallising. In this regard, we note also that
                    in Australia, admitted contingent claims are valued before they are counted (see
                        <em>Brash Holdings Ltd (Administrator appointed) and others v
                        Katile Pty Ltd and another</em> [1996] 1 VR 24 at 33, line
                    40). The statutory basis for this is found in Reg 5.6.23(2) of the
                    Australian Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth), made applicable by
                    Reg 5.6.11(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Finally, we state for the record that given
                    that the Respondent was insolvent in this case, we do not think that the votes
                    of the contingent creditors would have been discounted by any large extent that
                    would have affected the outcome of the Further Meeting held for the general body
                    of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Concluding remarks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In concluding, it is appropriate to recall
                    the oft-cited passage of Bowen LJ in <em>Sovereign Life
                        Assurance Company v Dodd</em> [1892] 2 QB 573 at 582 to
                    583, referring to s 2 of the Joint Stock Companies Arrangement Act 1870
                    (c 104) (33 &amp; 34 Vict) (a statutory predecessor of the UK
                    s 425)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is the proper construction of that statute? It makes the majority of
                        the creditors or of a class of creditors bind the minority; it exercises a
                        most formidable compulsion upon dissentient, or would-be dissentient,
                        creditors; and it therefore requires to be construed with care, so as not to
                        place in the hands of some of the creditors the means and opportunity of
                        forcing dissentients to do that which it is unreasonable to require them to
                        do, or of making a mere jest of the interests of the minority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The importance of maintaining the integrity
                    of the process in which proofs of debt are properly admitted or rejected for the
                    purpose of voting for or against a scheme of arrangement cannot be overstated.
                    Indeed, it is the only mechanism which protects minority dissenting creditors
                    from having an unhappy compromise that severely prejudices their rights foisted
                    upon them. Section 210 is silent on this mechanism but it is clear from its
                    subtext that a scheme must be grounded on the principles of transparency and
                    objectivity, implemented by an independent and impartial proposed scheme
                    manager. In the present case, the manner in which the proposed Scheme Manager
                    conducted this process, and the Scheme Meeting in particular, left much to be
                    desired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    In the result, it was clear that the Scheme
                    did not have the approval of the requisite majority of creditors voting at
                    meetings properly constituted. Therefore, the Judge had no jurisdiction to
                    sanction it. We thus allowed the appeals, set aside the sanction of the Scheme
                    and ordered the Further Meetings to be called for the same Scheme to be put to a
                    revote, subject to the directions as explained above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Post-script</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Pursuant to our directions, the Further
                    Meetings were held on 24 September 2010. We heard the parties again on
                    5 October 2010 and gave our decision on 13 October 2010. At the
                    Further Meeting for the general class of unsecured creditors, 51 of the Scheme
                    Creditors voted in favour of the Scheme, seven voted against the Scheme, and
                    three abstained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to our directions regarding
                    its claim for loss of profits (see <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above), Ho Lee submitted a proof that was based on the
                    application of the average <em>expected</em> percentage
                    profit calculated from three contracts for uncompleted projects. In our view, Ho
                    Lee did not comply with our directions. Therefore, its proof in that regard was
                    rightly disregarded by the Scheme Manager, who reported that a majority in
                    number representing 76.34% in value of the Scheme Creditors in the general class
                    of unsecured creditors had voted for the Scheme; <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> and that all of the Scheme Creditors in
                    the other class of creditors (comprising the subordinated and related creditors)
                    had also voted in favour of the Scheme.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Accordingly, we sanctioned the Scheme, but
                    subject to certain alterations made pursuant to our powers under s 210(4)
                    of the Act. These are set out at [8]
                    of the brief grounds of decision we issued on 13 October 2010 (see
                    Annexure II). We highlight the more significant alterations
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    First, several of the alterations pertained
                    to the Monitoring Committee (“MC”), which was provided for under
                    clause 6.42 of the Scheme. That clause stipulated that immediately after
                    the Scheme Meeting approving the Scheme, the Scheme Creditors were to form an MC
                    whose roles and responsibilities were set out in Schedule D.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> At
                    the hearing on 5 October 2010, we were informed by Counsel for the
                    Respondent of the composition of the MC in place. We were alarmed to note that
                    Akira Pte Ltd was on the MC. To ensure an appropriate level of representation of
                    the different creditors, we directed that three of the existing members of the
                    MC (including Akira Pte Ltd) be replaced with three new members (two of whom
                    were OCBC and Ho Lee) (see Annexure II at para 8(a)). We also
                    broadened the MC’s powers of oversight considerably so as to better enable
                    the MC to ensure accountability in the Scheme’s implementation (see
                    Annexure II at para 8(b), (c), (d) and (h)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Second, while clause 8.6 of the Scheme
                    provided that the Scheme Creditors had the power by Ordinary Resolution in a
                    general meeting to vary the terms of the Scheme, we altered the Scheme so that
                    procedural and substantive amendments had to be approved respectively by a
                    majority and 75% in value of the existing Scheme Creditors present and voting at
                    a meeting (see Annexure II at para 8(f)). Third, to address
                    OCBC’s and Ho Lee’s concerns regarding the ROFRs enjoyed by
                    Mr Sng and Ms Tong (relating, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, to restrictions on the price at which the subject assets were
                    to be offered to Mr Sng and Ms Tong, as well as the time which
                    Mr Sng and Ms Tong had to consider the offers and pay for the assets
                    in the event of their acceptance), we stipulated the manner in which the ROFRs
                    should be exercised (see Annexure II at para 8(g)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Finally, while we awarded OCBC all of its
                    costs on its appeal and below; we awarded Ho Lee only 50% of its costs on its
                    appeal and below (see Annexure II at para 9) as a number of its
                    arguments were not ultimately accepted. However, we ordered that both sets of
                    costs be paid by the Respondent as priority debts which were not subject to the
                    Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Annexure I: Orders/Directions of 27 August 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>27 August 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Orders/Directions of the Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_1"></a>1       The sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement by
                    the High Court is set aside. A new meeting (“Further Meeting”) is
                    to be called for the same Scheme to be put to a re-vote, subject to the
                    directions set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2_2"></a>2       Costs of appeal and the hearing below to both
                    appellants. This will be subject to the Scheme if it is sanctioned at the next

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3_3"></a>3       The following directions are given on the
                    basis of certain principles applicable to schemes of arrangement which will be
                    elaborated upon in our Grounds of Decision to be given later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Directions on voting rights of creditors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subordinated claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4_4"></a>4       This class refers to creditors whose claims
                    pertain to unpaid dividends and are therefore subordinated in liquidation
                    pursuant to s 250(1)(<em>g</em>) of the Companies Act
                    2006. This class of creditors is to be excluded from the general class of
                    unsecured creditors. They will vote in a separate class.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rights of first refusal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5_5"></a>5       Mr Sng Sze Hiang
                    (“Mr Sng”) and Ms Julia Tong
                    (“Ms Tong”), who have been accorded rights of first refusal

                    of hers which falls within the preceding category is to be excluded. Mr Sng
                    has to be excluded even if he relinquishes those rights because his entire claim
                    falls within the preceding category.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>13 October 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Statutory Vote </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2_20"></a>2       On 27 August 2010, we directed Ho Lee
                    Construction Pte Ltd (“Ho Lee”) at [10] of our Orders/Directions of Court
                    (“the direction”) to calculate its claim for loss of profits
                    arising from the termination of the subject Building Contract in this
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Take the average of Ho Lee’s profits (on a percentage basis) in
                        three of its largest contracts over the last two years preceding the date of
                        its Proof; and then</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apply that average percentage profit to the value of Ho Lee’s
                        contract with the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(This claim should then be certified by Ho Lee’s auditors
                    and submitted to the Scheme Manager within 14 days from the date
                hereof.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3_21"></a>3       In purported compliance, Ho Lee submitted a
                    proof for $32,950,800 that was based on the application of the average <em>expected</em> percentage profit calculated from three
                    contracts for projects that were as yet uncompleted. The average <em>expected</em> percentage profit was derived substantially
                    from estimates by Ho Lee itself that could not be verified by Ho Lee’s
                    auditors. These estimates included, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the expected duration of and the quantities of materials required for the
                    uncompleted projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4_22"></a>4       In our view, Ho Lee’s approach did not
                    comply with the direction. Plainly, the objective of the direction was to reduce
                    the degree of uncertainty with respect to the quantum of Ho Lee’s claim
                    for loss of profits to be admitted for the limited purpose of voting as an
                    unsecured creditor at the Further Meeting called pursuant to [14] of our Orders/Directions of Court dated
                    27 August 2010. Ho Lee was therefore expected to rely on verifiable audited
                    figures in relation to profits determined from completed contracts for which
                    accounts had been finalised during the stated period. Instead, Ho Lee preferred
                    to rely on profit estimates for contracts that are still in progress even
                    though, as its counsel admitted before us, it did have the requisite contracts
                    which it could have relied on to compute its claim for loss of profits. These
                    profit estimates would necessarily embrace an indeterminate number of
                    imponderables and cannot be relied upon to vote for or against the Scheme
                    without the risk of giving too much weightage to them. Accordingly, we rule that
                    the Scheme Manager acted correctly in disregarding Ho Lee’s proof in the
                    sum of $32,950,800 for the purposes of assessing the value of claims owed to
                    creditors, present and voting, who opposed the Scheme. We also wish to point out
                    that if Ho Lee genuinely entertained any doubts as to what the direction meant,
                    it ought to have sought clarification from this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5_23"></a>5       In the result, we declare that the Scheme has
                    met the requisite statutory threshold for creditors’ approval pursuant to
                    s 210(3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alterations to the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6_24"></a>6       Having considered Oversea-Chinese Banking
                    Corporation Limited (“OCBC”)’s and Ho Lee’s concerns
                    about the unfairness of some features of the Scheme and its implementation, we
                    hold that some alteration to the Scheme is required. In particular, there is a
                    lack of clarity in the milestones to be met in the implementation of the Scheme
                    and the methodology to be employed for assessing its ongoing viability. Also,
                    legitimate concerns have been voiced by the objecting creditors about the
                    quantum of professional fees and expenses incurred by the Respondent up to date
                    in relation to the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7_25"></a>7       In addition, we note that while the Scheme
                    provides for a Monitoring Committee (“MC”) to oversee the
                    implementation of the Scheme, its powers of oversight are unduly limited.
                    Further, Akira Corporation Pte Ltd, being a wholly owned subsidiary of the
                    Respondent, should not be a member of the MC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8_26"></a>8       To address these shortcomings in the Scheme
                    as well as other concerns, we have decided to approve the Scheme, subject to the
                    following alterations which we make pursuant to our powers under s 210(4)
                    of the Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a_27"></a>(a)     The MC should have the following
                    creditors as members:</p>

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p3_v"></a>(v)       OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a_28"></a>(a)     Any change to the composition of the MC
                    shall be subject to the approval of a majority of the other members of the MC;
                    and in the event of a deadlock, to the approval of this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b_29"></a>(b)     The Respondent shall provide, at the
                    request of the MC, any information pertaining to the Respondent’s
                    operations and finances in connection with the implementation of the
                    Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c_30"></a>(c)     The Budget for the Respondent’s
                    operations shall be subject to the MC’s approval. For the avoidance of
                    doubt, this will include all operating expenses and professional
                fees.</p>

                    the said ROFRs shall be exercised in this manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p3_i_32"></a>(i)       The Scheme Creditor will first offer the

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p3_ii_33"></a>(ii)       Mr Sng and Ms Tong will then
                    have two business days to consider whether to exercise their ROFRs to purchase
                    the subject assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p3_iii_34"></a>(iii)       If Mr Sng and Ms Tong decide
                    to exercise their ROFRs, they have 14 days from their acceptance of the offer to

                    an off-market sale at the proposed price or higher. If the offering Scheme
                    Creditor fails to sell the subject assets within 30 days, it can only sell the
                    subject assets by starting this process from step (i) above

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_i"></a>(i)     The claims of creditors related to the
                    Respondent (“the related party creditors”) shall rank after the

                    made on 27 August 2010.) OCBC is entitled to costs here and below. Ho Lee
                    is entitled to 50% of its costs here and below. Both OCBC’s and Ho
                    Lee’s costs shall be paid as priority debts (<em>ie</em>, not subject to the Scheme) by the Respondent. If
                    OCBC’s and Ho Lee’s costs cannot be agreed, they shall be taxed by
                    the High Court. The usual consequential orders are to follow.</p>
