In total, there are six Registrar’s Appeals before me.

Although Hoe Leong is an 80% shareholder in Ebony Ritz, even sole shareholding and control of a company do not warrant piercing the corporate veil without more. The court would only pierce the corporate veil where there had been some form of abuse. Sumatec has not established the requisite level of control by Hoe Leong over Ebony Ritz, nor is it able to show that there has been any element of impropriety or abuse which would justify piercing the corporate veil.

In support of this point, Ebony Ritz points to the wording of cl 3.6, as well as cll 5.5, 6.4 and 9.1(f) of the 2012 SPA and certain correspondences and negotiations between the parties leading up to the 2012 SPA.

Thus, Ebony Ritz contends that there were no “special circumstances” justifying a stay, and the AR should not have granted a stay of the Conditional Leave Order, or refused to approve the Draft Judgment.

The court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another suit </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 177 at [13] recognised that “the alternative application to strike out is really a mirror of the application for summary judgment”, and there is often an overlap between the two applications to the extent that a decision on one will often determine the outcome of the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It follows that the key question is whether Sumatec’s defence, as amended, is so lacking in merit that Ebony Ritz should be entitled to judgment without the matter proceeding to trial. This in turn may be broken down into the following issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether Ebony Ritz is entitled to judgment on the OFRA claim without the matter proceeding to trial; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether Ebony Ritz is entitled to judgment on the Guarantee claim without the matter proceeding to trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Of course, while there is an overlap between Ebony Ritz’s Summary Judgment and Striking Out Applications, distinct legal tests apply to each of these applications. The above issues will thus be discussed through the lens of the applicable legal principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The principles of law applicable to an application for summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the Rules are uncontroversial. The plaintiff seeking summary judgment must first show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for summary judgment. The burden then shifts to the defendant who must establish a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence in order to resist summary judgment (<span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte L</span><span class="font-italic">td v Matsumura Akihiko </span>[2015] 1 SLR 325 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Under O 14 r 3 of the Rules, the defendant may also resist summary judgment by establishing “that there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried” or “that there ought for some other reason to be a trial”. However, since the Defendant has not sought to resist summary judgment on the basis that “there ought for some other reason to be a trial”, I need not consider this point (<span class="font-italic">Ritzland Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management &amp; Consultancy Services Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1342 at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It has been noted that in summary judgment proceedings, it is generally inappropriate for the court to delve into points of construction that may take hours or days. On the other hand, the O 14 procedure is appropriate if the question of construction is short and depends on only a few documents (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span>, Vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">SCP</span>”) at para 14/1/2, citing the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[1990] 1 WLR 153).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In general, where a defendant shows that he has a fair case for a defence, or reasonable grounds for setting up a defence, or even a fair probability that has a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence, he ought to have leave to defend (<span class="font-italic">Habibullah Mohamed Yousuff v Indian Bank </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 880 at [21]). However, O 14 r 4 of the Rules gives the Court the power to impose such conditions as it thinks fit on the defendant’s leave to defend. A condition will be imposed where the defence is found to be shadowy, or where it appears to the court that a defence <span class="font-italic">may</span> succeed but that it is improbable that it would (<span class="font-italic">Wee Cheng Swee Henry v Jo Baby Kartika Polim </span>[2015] 4 SLR 250 at [81]–[82]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Striking out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The principles relating to striking out of pleadings under O 18 r 19 of the Rules are equally well-established. In general, the power to strike out a pleading is only exercised in “plain and obvious” cases (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]). As for the four specific grounds which may be relied on to strike out a pleading in O 18 r 19(1)(a)–O 18 r 19(1)(d) of the Rules, I set out a summary of the principles behind each ground:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under O 18 r 19(1)(a), the court may strike out a pleading on the ground that it discloses no reasonable defence. A reasonable defence is one that has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleadings are considered (<span class="font-italic">The “Tokai Maru” </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 646 at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under O 18 r 19(1)(b), the Court may strike out a pleading on the ground that it is “frivolous or vexatious”. The words “frivolous or vexatious” have been interpreted to refer to cases which are “obviously unsustainable or wrong” (see <span class="font-italic">Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 188 at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">Afro-Asia Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v Haridass Ho &amp; Partners</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  Under O 18 r 19(1)(c), the Court may strike out a pleading on the basis that “it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action”. This may include pleadings which are unnecessary or which include improper or irrelevant details (<span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Tian Yong Johnny </span>[2016] SGHC 206 at [39], citing Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure </span>(Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 9.008).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Under O 18 r 19(1)(d), the Court may strike out a pleading on the basis that “it is otherwise an abuse of process of the Court”. The phrase “abuse of process” signifies that the process of the court must be used <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and properly (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners</span> at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision and reasons</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Ebony Ritz is entitled to judgment on the OFRA claim without the matter proceeding to trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Applying the legal test for summary judgment, I am satisfied that Ebony Ritz has established its claim under the OFRA on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The “compromise agreement” allegedly took the form of the 2012 SPA and/or the CLO Agreement. Sumatec contends that in order to discern whether the 2012 SPA and/or the CLO Agreement were a valid compromise, the court will have to scrutinise the facts to discern whether the parties “intended to dispose of their actual or potential dispute by reaching an amicable resolution through those agreements” (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”) at [42]). On this basis, Sumatec argues that there are triable issues which are unsuitable for summary determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In <span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous</span>, the plaintiff had sold a cargo of coal to Bhatia International Ltd (“Bhatia”). As sub-charterer of the vessel, the Pacific Vigorous, Bhatia issued letters of indemnity to the head time-charterer, Eitzen, to enable delivery of the cargo to be made without the relevant bills of lading issued for the cargo being produced. Eitzen, in turn, issued back-to-back letters of indemnity to the defendant as the owner of the Pacific Vigorous. After a dispute arose between the plaintiff and Bhatia over the contractual quality of the cargo, Bhatia unilaterally deducted a sum for alleged breach of the sale contract from the total sum due to the plaintiff. The plaintiff regarded the sum paid by Bhatia as partial payment for the cargo. The plaintiff, as lawful holders of the relevant bills of lading, then commenced <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>proceedings against the Pacific Vigorous for the loss it had suffered due to the misdelivery of the cargo to Bhatia. Seeking to resist the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment, the defendant argued that there was a triable issue as to whether the plaintiff’s acceptance of part-payment for the cargo amounted to an election which precluded it from recovering damages from the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Belinda Ang J rejected the defendant’s arguments and gave summary judgment for the plaintiff, holding that the doctrines of common law election and equitable election were inapplicable. She observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With regard to the doctrine of common law election, Ang J observed that election at common law occurs where a person has two mutually exclusive and inconsistent rights or courses of action, and the said person by an overt act communicates to the other party that he is relying on one such right, with the effect that he is precluded from later claiming the benefit of the other right (<span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous </span>at [15]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With regard to the doctrine of election in equity, Ang J stated that this doctrine meant that a party could not both accept an instrument or judgment and reject it. Election in equity was in this way referable to the principle that a person cannot approbate and reprobate an instrument or judgment. It followed that where facts exist, which attract the application of the doctrine of equitable election, the person concerned must choose whether he will take under or against the instrument or judgment. He cannot take a benefit under the instrument or judgment without taking the burden (<span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous </span>at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Both these doctrines require an unequivocal representation by the party making the election in relation to the right or remedy allegedly being waived (<span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous </span>at [17] and [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous</span>, Ang J reasoned that the doctrine of common law election was inapplicable because the plaintiff did not have two inconsistent rights as against Bhatia and the defendant. Its claims fell under two contracts (its sale contract with Bhatia and its contract of carriage with the defendant) which gave rise to separate and independent causes of action against two different parties (at [18]). The plaintiff’s remedies as against Bhatia on the one hand and the defendant on the other were cumulative, not alternative remedies, such that the plaintiff was not required to choose between these two remedies (at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Ang J also held that the doctrine of equitable election was inapplicable because the plaintiff’s acceptance of part-payment for the cargo was not an unequivocal act that outwardly signified an election (at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I did not see that as conduct involving an implicit unequivocal representation that the cargo had been delivered to the proper person under the sale contract and that Agritrade would not claim any right that depended upon on [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] an assertion of misdelivery of the cargo. As Lord Goff highlighted in <span class="font-italic">The Kanchenjunga</span>… an election requires an unequivocal representation by one party who in making his election is communicating his choice whether or not to exercise a right which has become available to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In oral submissions, learned counsel for Ebony Ritz, Ms Wendy Lin, argued that the <span class="font-italic">Pacific Vigorous </span>does <span class="font-italic">not </span>assist Sumatec because Ebony Ritz’s right to claim for damages under the OFRA is <span class="font-italic">cumulative</span> and not <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>to its right to pursue the shares in SISB under the 2012 SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my view, there is no merit to Sumatec’s argument that Ebony Ritz has made an election by entering into the 2012 SPA and therefore can no longer bring an action for sums due and owing under the OFRA, or claim damages against Sumatec for breaches of the OFRA. Even on the assumption that the right to claim for damages or sums due and owing under the OFRA is indeed inconsistent with and/or alternative to the right to obtain shares in SISB through the 2012 SPA, the question is whether it could be said that Ebony Ritz had, by entering into the 2012 SPA, made an “unequivocal representation” that it would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be exercising its right to claim (i) payment of sums due and owing under the OFRA; or (ii) damages for breach of the OFRA. That question must be answered in the negative, in light of the <span class="font-italic">terms </span>of the 2012 SPA. As I have mentioned, cl 7 of the 2012 SPA (as amended by Addendum No 1) (hereinafter “Clause 7”) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Save for the compensation for the profit shortfall in the form of of 61,656,000 Sumatec Resources Berhad Special Issue Shares valued at RM10.8 Million which [Ebony Ritz] hereby agrees to transfer its right to the CLO Bondholders as part of the global debt settlement with the CLO Bondholders and subject to clauses 5.5 and 6.4, <span class="font-italic">[Ebony Ritz] hereby agrees that, conditional on both 1st Completion and 2nd Completion taking place (in accordance with this Agreement) and upon both 1</span><span class="font-italic">st Completion and 2nd Completion,</span> it shall release and discharge [Sumatec] from all liabilities, obligations, claims and demands whatsoever and howsoever directly relating to or arising from, and waives all rights which it may have against [Sumatec] in respect of any accrued claims or liabilities under the [OFRA] in relation to [Ebony Ritz’s] exercise of the Purchaser Call Option and the Priority Call Option.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Clause 7 makes clear that Ebony Ritz’s agreement to release and discharge Sumatec from its accrued claims under the OFRA was <span class="font-italic">subject to the </span><span class="font-italic">conditions </span>contained in the 2012 SPA, including, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the condition that the 1st Completion and the 2nd Completion were to take place in accordance with the 2012 SPA. The same point is set out in Paragraph (F) of the Recitals to the 2012 SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In the light of this, it cannot be argued that Ebony Ritz’s entry into the 2012 SPA constituted an “unequivocal representation” that it was abandoning its rights to claim from Sumatec sums due and owing under the OFRA, or to claim damages from Sumatec for breaches of the OFRA. In fact, the wording of terms such as Clause 7 implicitly suggest the very opposite – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that if the conditions spelled out in the 2012 SPA were <span class="font-italic">not </span>complied with, then Ebony Ritz would <span class="font-italic">not </span>release and discharge Sumatec from its liabilities under the OFRA. It follows that the doctrine of election does not apply to bar Ebony Ritz’s claims under the OFRA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In a similar vein, I am of the view that the case of <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>does not assist Sumatec. Sumatec cites <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>for the proposition that where parties demonstrate that they intended to dispose of their actual or potential dispute by reaching an amicable resolution agreeable to both parties, this compromise will be recognised and given effect to by the courts (at [42]). I certainly have no quarrel with that proposition. But to “give effect” to the compromise in this case must mean to give effect to the full terms of the 2012 SPA. That includes giving effect to Clause 7, which provides in no uncertain terms that Sumatec’s release from liability under the OFRA is <span class="font-italic">conditional upon </span>the execution of <span class="font-italic">both </span>the 1st and 2nd Completions in accordance with the terms of the 2012 SPA. Given the (undisputed) fact that the 2nd Completion has not taken place, Ebony Ritz has not released Sumatec from its accrued claims under the OFRA. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>the Court of Appeal noted that if the the documents in that case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Points of Agreement (“POA”) and Waiver Letter) <span class="font-italic">did </span>constitute a valid compromise, “the defendant would have been released from all his legal obligations under the Trust Deed <span class="font-italic">provided that he had complied with the relevant terms of the POA</span>” [emphasis added] (at [11]). The implication was that if the terms of the POA had <span class="font-italic">not </span>been complied with, then the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>was <span class="font-italic">not </span>released from his legal obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Thus, although Ebony Ritz has entered into the 2012 SPA, and even on the assumption that the 2012 SPA is a “valid compromise”, the compromise was clearly contingent and dependant on the conditions being fulfilled. Ebony Ritz, by agreeing to a <span class="font-italic">conditional</span> compromise, has not given up its right to claim against Sumatec for breaches of the OFRA. For similar reasons, I am of the view that Sumatec has not succeeded in raising a “triable issue” through its argument that Ebony Ritz is not entitled to the full sum that it claims for the Financial Shortfall for FY2011 by virtue of the <span class="font-italic">1st Completion</span> having allegedly occurred (see [62(d)] above). By specifying that the release of Sumatec’s liability shall be conditional upon <span class="font-italic">both</span> the 1st and 2nd Completions taking place, Ebony Ritz has preserved its right to pursue its claims under the OFRA <span class="font-italic">if </span>the 1st and 2nd Completions do <span class="font-italic">not </span>take place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I note that the Compromise defence put forward by Sumatec against Ebony Ritz’s claim is based on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the 2012 SPA and the CLO Agreement.

In relation to this, HLCL, Setinggi and the Borrower have entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 2012 (“the SISB Sale and Purchase Agreement”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my view, Recital 4 does not assist Sumatec. The recitals to a contract do not impose legal obligations on the parties (<span class="font-italic">Tiger</span><span class="font-italic"> Airways Pte Ltd v Swissport Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 992 at [34]), much less make a person or entity a party to a contract. At best, Recital 4 suggests or asserts that Ebony Ritz agreed to purchase 2% of the shares in SISB. The point remains that Ebony Ritz is not a party to the CLO. The parties to the CLO are different from the parties to the 2012 SPA. The parties to the 2012 SPA are also different from the parties to the OFRA and 2010 SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I do not see how the reference to Ebony Ritz by way of an assertion supports the submission that Ebony Ritz has compromised its claims. Unlike the 2012 SPA, the CLO Agreement makes no reference to any agreement by Ebony Ritz to discharge Sumatec from its obligations under the 2010 SPA and the OFRA. I therefore fail to see how Ebony Ritz has compromised its claim through the CLO Agreement. Indeed, it appears that after entering into the 2012 SPA, Sumatec likely encountered problems in securing the consent of the CLO bondholders for the 1st and 2nd Tranche sale shares and obtaining written evidence of agreement of the Trustee to release the charge over the 2nd Tranche sale shares. The CLO Agreement which Ebony Ritz was not a party to sets out, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the terms and conditions under which the CLO bondholders would provide consent for the transfer of the shares. These included the obligation that SISB was to pay the 1st and 2nd Tranche Dividends on the dates specified. Unsurprisingly, the CLO bondholders were a party to the CLO Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In the light of the foregoing, I find that Sumatec has not raised a “triable issue” or a reasonable probability that it has a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence in the form of the Compromise defence. The Compromise defence cannot form a basis for Sumatec to resist summary judgment under O 14, and is also “obviously unsustainable”. I therefore strike it out as disclosing no reasonable defence or as being “frivolous or vexatious” under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules, respectively.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The cl 3 OFRA defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I turn now to consider Sumatec’s argument that Ebony Ritz is not entitled to seek compensation for the Financial Shortfall for FY2011 in cash.

</div> I see no basis for this assertion that evidence must be adduced to establish the right. To begin with, the language of cl 3.3 is <span class="font-italic">permissive </span>and not restrictive – it states that the parties agree that Ebony Ritz “<span class="font-italic">has the</span><span class="font-italic"> right to </span>elect…to have any Financial Shortfall be satisfied by way of [the three methods listed in cl 3.3]”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 While cl 3.1 states that “Sumatec agrees and undertakes to pay and make good [the Financial Shortfalls] to [Ebony Ritz] in accordance with this Clause 3”, I disagree with Sumatec’s argument that the words “in accordance with this Clause 3” should be understood to mean that Ebony Ritz was limited to the options stated in cl 3.3. The relevant provisions in OFRA should be construed together and in the light of the OFRA as a whole. This includes the point referred to earlier that the stated objective of the agreement was to set out the terms and conditions governing the adjustments to be made on account of shortfalls in the Financial Representations (see [13] above). Clause 3.1 sets out the method of calculating the Financial Shortfall and subjects Sumatec to the duty to pay and make good the shortfall “in accordance with this Clause 3.” The reference to “this Clause 3” follows immediately after the words which impose the duty “to pay and make good<span class="font-italic">.</span>” I am of the view that “in accordance with this Clause 3” refers to the fact that the shortfall should be calculated according to the formulae specified in cl 3.1. The core obligation imposed on Sumatec under cl 3 was the duty to pay and make good the assessed Financial Shortfall. Clause 3.3 then goes on to provide Ebony Ritz with the right to elect to have any Financial Shortfall to be satisfied by way of (i) the issue of new Sumatec Shares to Ebony Ritz; (ii) the exercise of the Priority Call Options; or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). It bears emphasising again that the language of cl 3.3 is <span class="font-italic">permissive </span>and not restrictive. I therefore do not accept Sumatec’s submission that Ebony Ritz is <span class="font-italic">limited </span>strictly to seeking compensation using the methods specified in cl 3.3</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Further, and more to the point, Ebony Ritz’s entitlement to have the Financial Shortfall for FY2011 satisfied in kind is <span class="font-italic">already</span> evidenced clearly by cl 19 of the OFRA, which specifies that no “single or partial exercise of any right or remedy [shall] preclude…the exercise of any other right or remedy”, and further that the “rights provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.” I fully agree with the AR that this can only mean that the Plaintiff’s rights to seek compensation for breaches of the OFRA are not limited to the three options listed in cl 3.3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97  In reaching this decision, I emphasise that in the course of these appeals Sumatec did not proffer any arguments addressing the import of cl 19, or explaining why, notwithstanding the existence of cl 19, Sumatec maintained its position that the only means by which Ebony Ritz is entitled to seek satisfaction of the shortfall are those set out in cl 3.3. This was despite it <span class="font-italic">acknowledging</span> the fact that cl 19 was the decisive factor in the AR’s decision to disallow the Paragraph 15 Amendments.

</div> This sum appears to have been claimed as <span class="font-italic">an amount due and owing</span> (pursuant to Sumatec’s <span class="font-italic">primary </span>obligation to make good the Financial Shortfall for FY2011 under the OFRA), and not as <span class="font-italic">damages </span>(pursuant to Sumatec’s <span class="font-italic">secondary </span>obligation to compensate Ebony Ritz after Sumatec breached the OFRA by failing to honour the Priority Call Option). But given my decision that the 2012 SPA did not result in a compromise of Ebony Ritz’s rights under OFRA (because the conditions were never met) Ebony Ritz would at the very least have a right to bring a claim for damages for Sumatec’s failure to comply with the Priority Call Option. Sumatec does not dispute that there was a shortfall in the Financial Representations and that it was under a duty to make these good under OFRA. The Priority Call Option was, of course, one method whereby the Financial Shortfall as assessed could be made good, but Sumatec failed to satisfy the Financial Shortfall by that method. The 2012 SPA, too, might have resulted in a compromise of Ebony Ritz’s rights under the OFRA if the conditions had been met by Sumatec. But it did not have that result since Sumatec did not fulfil the conditions. The point I make is that even if Ebony Ritz did not have the right to seek payment in cash for the Financial Shortfall, it would be entitled to damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Estoppel defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I turn now to address the argument that Ebony Ritz is estopped from exercising its rights under the 2012 SPA.

</div> However, at least as far as the 1st Completion is concerned, since the point contended for is that Ebony Ritz is estopped by virtue of Hoe Leong’s conduct, it must be Sumatec’s position that <span class="font-italic">Ebony Ritz was the principal, and </span><span class="font-italic">that Hoe Leong was the agent</span> (since it would not make sense to speak of Ebony Ritz as <span class="font-italic">agent </span>being estopped by the conduct of Hoe Leong as <span class="font-italic">principal</span>). Thus, Sumatec would need to succeed in showing that <span class="font-italic">Hoe Leong </span>is the agent of Ebony Ritz to make out at least one necessary aspect of the Estoppel defence – that Ebony Ritz is estopped from arguing that the 1st Completion has not occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The authorities cited by Sumatec itself suggest that any argument that Hoe Leong is an agent of Ebony Ritz is doomed to fail. In <span class="font-italic">Smith, Stone &amp; Knight</span>, Atkinson J commented at 121 that it is a question of fact in each case whether a subsidiary was carrying on business as the company’s own business or as its own. After reviewing a few cases, Atkinson J formulated six indicia for the purposes of determining the question: who was really carrying on the business (or put differently, whether a company is an agent of another):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Were the profits treated as the profits of the parent company?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Were the persons conducting the business appointed by the parent company?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Was the company the head and the brain of the trading venture?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Did the company govern the adventure, deciding what should be done and what capital should be embarked on the venture?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Did the company make the profits by its skill and direction?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Was the company in effectual and constant control?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In the Singapore context, it has been noted by the Court of Appeal that the above indicia are “helpful guidelines” but not a conclusive or definitive test applicable in all circumstances in determining whether a business is carried on by a subsidiary as the principal or as an agent for its holding company (<span class="font-italic">Miller Freeman Exhibitions Pte Ltd v Singapore Industrial Automation Association and another</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 177 at [22]). <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon </span>at para 2.69 suggests that, in addition to the above factors, an agency arrangement may more readily be inferred where the negotiations leading to a contract are all conducted by the alleged principal, even though the contract is formally entered into by the alleged agent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Applying the above factors, Hoe Leong is evidently not Ebony Ritz’s agent. As Ebony Ritz emphasises, Hoe Leong is a public company listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2005.

</div> Therefore, I find that the argument that Hoe Leong was an agent or <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> of Ebony Ritz is unsustainable. It follows that the argument that Ebony Ritz is estopped by virtue of Hoe Leong’s conduct is also untenable. For similar reasons, I see no merit in the argument that Hoe Leong holds shares in SISB as agent for Ebony Ritz. Thus, insofar as Sumatec’s position that Ebony Ritz is estopped from saying the 2nd Completion has not occurred rests on the contention that Ebony Ritz is the “majority shareholder” of SISB and failed to procure it to pay the 2nd Tranche Dividends to the Trustee, that position is also unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The corporate veil argument</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Apart from the arguments on agency, another means by which Sumatec seeks to identify Hoe Leong with Ebony Ritz is through its pleading that “the corporate veil of Ebony Ritz should be lifted”.

Coomaraswamy J distilled the following principles at [195]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point in Singapore law is that a company has a separate legal personality from its owners and controllers, even if it is one of a number of companies which form a group of companies through common or interlocking ownership or control (<span class="font-italic">Adams</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Cape Industries plc and another </span>[1990] Ch 433);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The doctrine of separate legal personality is not displaced simply because companies are organised as a “single economic unit” (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Lew Syn Pau and another </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 210 at [212]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The doctrine of separate legal personality is not displaced simply because the owners of a company have incorporated it for the purpose of insulating themselves or other group companies from liability. That is the very purpose of the limited liability company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Coomaraswamy J also endorsed the holding of Lord Sumption JSC in the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Prest v Petrodel Resources</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd and others </span>[2013] 2 AC 415 (“<span class="font-italic">Prest</span>”) at [34] that the corporate veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [199]). Coomaraswamy J noted Lord Sumption JSC’s distinction between the “concealment principle” and the “evasion principle”. The concealment principle was at play where, notwithstanding the interposition of a company to conceal the identity of the real actors, a court would look behind the corporate façade to identify the real actors. The evasion principle was where the court would disregard the corporate veil if a company has been used to defeat a right or frustrate the enforcement of a right against the person in control of the company which exists independently of the company involvement (<span class="font-italic">Prest </span>at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [200]). While Lord Sumption JSC and Lord Neuberger PSC had taken the view that it was only in cases of evasion that the corporate veil should be pierced, the other members of the UK Supreme Court had not endorsed such analysis without qualification (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [201]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Based on the arguments before him, Coomaraswamy J declined to make a finding as to whether or not the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil should be limited to cases falling within the evasion principle under Singapore law (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [202]). He proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff’s submissions for lifting the corporate veil were based on the concealment principle, and on the facts, declined to lift the corporate veil as between the various corporate defendants. In coming to that view, Coomaraswamy J made clear that “some measure of connectedness or closeness” between two companies will not justify disregarding their separate legal personalities (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [211]). Thus, the fact that several companies may be family owned and may have common directors or shareholders will not justify lifting the corporate veil (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [205] and [210]), nor will the fact that the owners or controllers of that company have not honoured a strict demarcation between the various corporate entities in e-mail correspondence (<span class="font-italic">Simgood </span>at [206]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Putting aside for now the distinction between the concealment principle and the evasion principle, Coomaraswamy J certainly endorsed the view that the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil was limited to cases where there had been an abuse of corporate form. That view was also approved by Lee Kim Shin JC in <span class="font-italic">Manuchar Steel Hong Kong Ltd v Star Pacific Line Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 832 at [95] (also citing <span class="font-italic">Prest</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Having considered the arguments and the relevant principles, I am of the view that the attempt to lift the corporate veil of Ebony Ritz is devoid of merit. The commonality of “communication details”, that Hoe Leong and Ebony Ritz shared two common directors, and that certain third parties may have referred to Hoe Leong and Ebony Ritz interchangeably are facts insufficient for this court to disregard the separate legal personality of these two entities. As for the argument that the 2012 SPA “confers no benefit on Ebony Ritz” because it would have agreed to release and discharge Sumatec from liability under the OFRA in return for the transfer of SISB shares to <span class="font-italic">Setinggi and Hoe Leong</span>, that simply accords with the uncontroversial principle that parties may contract for a benefit to be conferred on a third party. Further, while Sumatec submits that Hoe Leong was the controlling mind and spirit of Ebony Ritz and has “sole control” over the direction and operations of Ebony Ritz, this overlooks the fact that Ebony Ritz is 20% owned by Auspicious Journey, which has a nominated director, Mr Kuek Kien Joo, sitting on the board of Ebony Ritz.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As regards the element of abuse or impropriety, learned counsel for Sumatec, Ms Thenuga d/o Vijakumar, stated in oral submissions that the impropriety stems from the fact that “Hoe Leong who holds 51% can now say, I did not help you with the 2nd Completion, but be that as it may, Ebony Ritz is holding 49%, and I’m now going to sue you for the 2010 obligations”. However, I see nothing illegitimate or abusive about the way that the parties agreed to (conditionally) compromise their rights and liabilities under the 2012 SPA. Lord Sumption JSC observed that the corporate veil may be lifted “if a company’s separate legal personality is being abused for the purpose of some <span class="font-italic">relevant wrongdoing</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Prest </span>at [27]). Sumatec does not suggest that Hoe Leong has used Ebony Ritz to perpetrate any <span class="font-italic">wrongdoing</span>. It says that it is improper for Hoe Leong or Ebony Ritz to now pursue its claims under the OFRA only in the sense that Hoe Leong and Ebony Ritz are now allegedly “estopped” from so doing. But facts giving rise to an <span class="font-italic">estoppel </span>(if indeed the facts give rise to an estoppel) do not necessarily give rise to a finding of abuse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 There is nothing to suggest that Ebony Ritz has been used as a sham or façade. To the extent Sumatec may complain that the structure of the 2012 SPA makes it such that Hoe Leong is entitled to the benefit of the 1st Tranche Sale Shares without a corresponding burden of procuring SISB to pay the 2nd Tranche Dividends, I find nothing abusive or improper about this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As an aside, Sumatec chose to enter into the 2012 SPA at a time when it was <span class="font-italic">already </span>liable for having breaching its obligations to Ebony Ritz under the 2010 SPA and the OFRA. It is undisputed that there was a shortfall in SISB’s PAT for FY2011; that Sumatec was liable to make this shortfall good under the OFRA; and that Sumatec failed to make good the shortfall after Ebony Ritz exercised the Priority Call Option. That failure was the very reason the 2012 SPA came about. Given this context, I fail to see how Sumatec can argue that<span class="font-italic"> </span>either Hoe Leong or Ebony Ritz<span class="font-italic"> should</span> bear any obligation to assist it in facilitating the 2nd Completion by securing the consent of the CLO Bondholders. Yet, by asserting that there is “impropriety” in Hoe Leong obtaining the 1st Tranche Sale Shares without having to procure SISB’s payment of the 2nd Tranche Dividends, Sumatec implies that “propriety” demands that Hoe Leong or Ebony Ritz should be responsible for facilitating the performance of the conditions stipulated in the 2012 SPA and/or the CLO agreement. I am unable to agree. It follows that Sumatec has failed to make out any kind of abuse or impropriety that would justify lifting of the corporate veil. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For completeness, I note that Sumatec has relied heavily on the case of <span class="font-italic">STX Mumbai</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> I agree entirely with Ebony Ritz that this was a decision concerning anticipatory breach, and lifting of the corporate veil was not in issue. The Court mentioned lifting the corporate veil <span class="font-italic">solely </span>in the course of summarising the Appellant’s arguments (<span class="font-italic">STX Mumbai </span>at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I therefore find that Sumatec’s submissions on agency and lifting of the corporate veil are unsustainable. Insofar as the AR felt that these arguments were not so unsustainable as to warrant their immediate striking out,

</div> I would respectfully differ. As I shall explain below, I also felt that given the deficiencies in the Estoppel defence <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>, Sumatec has not been able to establish a reasonable probability that it was a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The Estoppel defence as a whole</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As I have mentioned, Sumatec’s Estoppel defence is premised upon the identification of Hoe Leong with Ebony Ritz. The difficulties with the arguments on agency and lifting of the corporate veil <span class="font-italic">alone </span>would found a conclusion that this defence is unsustainable. In addition, even if I disregard those difficulties, there are other deficiencies with the Estoppel defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 To begin with, one of the key planks of the defence is the argument that Ebony Ritz prevented Sumatec from carrying out the 2nd Completion by failing to procure SISB to pay the 2nd Tranche Dividends to the Trustee (see [102(b)] above). I saw a degree of irony in this argument since, following the transfer of the 1st Tranche Sale Shares, Ebony Ritz actually held 49% of the shares in SISB, which put it in the <span class="font-italic">exact same position </span>as Sumatec itself, which <span class="font-italic">also</span> held 49% of the shares in SISB at that time (see [34] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 However, even if I assume that Ebony Ritz’s identity could be conflated with Hoe Leong’s, and Ebony Ritz was thus a “majority shareholder” owning not merely 49% but <span class="font-italic">51% </span>of the shares in SISB, and even if I further assume that Ebony Ritz was thereby in a position to procure SISB to pay the 2nd Tranche Dividends to the Trustee, I fail to see how that would further Sumatec’s defence. I agree with Ebony Ritz that Sumatec has not explained how it was “<span class="font-italic">prevented</span> from carrying out its obligations in relation to the 2nd Completion”.

</div>
</div> It seems to me that the substance of Sumatec’s complaint is <span class="font-italic">not</span> that it has been <span class="font-italic">prevented</span> from carrying out its obligations, but rather that Ebony Ritz and/or Hoe Leong have not <span class="font-italic">assisted </span>it to procure the CLO Bondholders’ consent by paying the 2nd Tranche Dividends, despite being in a position to do so. However, I fail to see the basis on which Sumatec argues that it was entitled to expect such assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Even if it were true that Ebony Ritz and/or Hoe Leong had prevented Sumatec from performing its obligations under the 2012 SPA, this would not afford Sumatec a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence. Sumatec contends that it was an implied term of the 2012 SPA that Ebony Ritz would not prevent Sumatec from carrying out the 2nd Completion (see [102(a)] above). Putting aside the point that this “implied term” is not pleaded in the defence, the more fundamental problem is that Sumatec does not go on to plead what the <span class="font-italic">impact </span>of such an implied term is. In this regard, I agree with Ebony Ritz that Sumatec has not pleaded how the alleged “prevention” affords Sumatec a defence to the OFRA claim.

</div>
</div> If indeed such an obligation of non-prevention were implied into the 2012 SPA, taking Sumatec’s case at its highest, the conclusion that would follow would be that Ebony Ritz had breached the 2012 SPA. It would <span class="font-italic">not </span>follow that Sumatec was thereby automatically discharged from its obligations under the OFRA. I also note that notwithstanding the opportunity it was given to amend its defence, Sumatec has not pleaded how the alleged implied term fits into the wider scheme of the Estoppel defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I note that it has been observed that a court presiding over a summary judgment proceeding should “be slow to venture into a contextual assessment of words and/or conduct encompassed in a claim of estoppel” (<span class="font-italic">SCP </span>at para 14/4/5).

Sumatec’s defence to the Guarantee Claim centres on cl 3.6 of the 2012 SPA, which I reproduce here for convenience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On 1st Completion or three (3) months after the date of this Agreement, whichever is later, [Setinggi] and [Hoe Leong] shall use all reasonable endeavours to procure a discharge of all those corporate guarantees issued by [Sumatec] in respect of loan and other facilities granted to the Semua Group by its relevant lenders (“Sumatec Guarantees”).

</div> At least one possible interpretation of this is that Setinggi and Hoe Leong’s obligation to use reasonable endeavours to obtain a discharge of the corporate guarantees takes effect only <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 1st Completion occurs, and correspondingly Setinggi and/or Ebony Ritz’s obligation to indemnify Sumatec only takes effect <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 1st Completion occurs.

The idea that Sumatec undertakes to procure SISB to pay its debts and liabilities (cl 9.1(f)) is not necessarily inconsistent with Ebony Ritz’s undertaking to indemnify and hold Sumatec harmless against claims made pursuant to the Guarantee (cl 3.6).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To the extent that any inconsistency exists between cl 3.6 and cll 5.5, 6.4 and 9.1(f), the question of how to resolve such inconsistency is a triable issue. In this regard, I agree with the AR that one relevant consideration might be whether cl 3.6 is intended to take precedence over the other allegedly inconsistent clauses of the 2012 SPA.

Shortly afterwards, at 5.56pm, Sumatec served the application for stay on Ebony Ritz. Ebony Ritz responded by seeking to enter judgment against Sumatec for the OFRA claim. To that end, Ebony Ritz sent the Draft Judgment to Sumatec’s lawyers after 5pm.

It also served the application on Ebony Ritz after the time for providing the Security had already expired. It is also clear that Ebony Ritz were aware on 8 March 2017 when they sent the Draft Judgment to Sumatec’s lawyers for approval that Sumatec had: (i) filed the appeal; and (ii) proposed parties should consent to a stay. Does this make a difference? I am of the view that, on the facts before me, it does not. Sumatec was equally aware by 7 March 2017 that Ebony Ritz did not consent to a stay. They knew time was fast running out and that Ebony Ritz was entitled to enter judgment after 5pm on 8 March 2017. No attempt was made to apply and obtain an urgent stay from the Court before the expiration of time. Indeed, the application was only made and served 22 minutes before the expiry of time. The date of the hearing was some three weeks later. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Second, it is also clear that when Ebony Ritz submitted the Draft Judgment to the Court for approval on 14 March 2017, Ebony Ritz was aware that the application for stay would be heard in three days’ time. The AR comments that it was not appropriate for Ebony Ritz to seek entry of judgment when they knew a stay application had been made.

Further, at para 42/7/7 it is stated that every order should be drawn up and extracted (with some exceptions) and that an omission to do this does not relieve a party from the obligation to obey the order unless the order is of such a kind as to render obedience contingent on the service of the order. O 42 r 8 sets out provisions on the preparation of the judgment or order and the submission of the draft to the solicitor of the other party. Ebony Ritz relies on O 42 r 8(2) and deemed consent by Sumatec to the terms on the basis that Sumatec did not respond to the Draft Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Having regard to these provisions, I am of the view that the burden is on Sumatec to make a timely application for a stay of execution under the Rules. The fact that they knew Ebony Ritz did not agree to a stay by consent only served to make the matter much more urgent. Ebony Ritz, even though it was appealing for summary judgment, was entitled in any case to the “fruits” of the orders that had been granted. Sumatec must have known that under the order granting conditional leave to defend, Ebony Ritz was entitled to enter judgment from the moment time expired. The order expressly provides that failing provision of the security by 5pm 8 March 2017 “judgment shall be entered against the Defendant for this sum, with interests as well as costs to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, to be taxed or agreed”.

</div> The fact that a party has made an application for stay does not mean that some form of interim stay goes into existence to cover the period between application and the hearing of the stay application. If an interim stay was needed, Sumatec could and should have sought an interim stay pending the hearing of the stay application especially since they had received the Draft Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146  The submissions of Ebony Ritz on its Stay Appeal concentrates on the above points and they assert that they were entitled to enter judgment after 5pm 8 March 2017. On the other hand, Sumatec relies on the AR’s finding that entry of judgment would have rendered the application for stay nugatory. The difficulty however is that Order 42 r 7 is clear that a judgment takes effect from the time when it is pronounced rather than the date when it is drawn up and entered. That said, <span class="font-italic">SCP</span> explains at para 42/7/4 that execution cannot issue till after entry of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Accordingly, I am of the view that the AR erred in not accepting the Draft Judgment. The parties did not, in their submissions before me, go into the substantive question as to whether grant of a stay was in any event appropriate on the facts of the case. I make no further comment since I have in any case found that Ebony Ritz is entitled to summary judgment and that the AR erred in granting conditional leave in the first place on the OFRA claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I shall hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wendy Lin Weiqi and Goh Wei Wei (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Thenuga d/o Vijakumar (Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
