</div> The other two siblings each received separate immovable property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I found that the Inherited Property did not form part of the matrimonial assets. Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter provides that any asset acquired by one party by gift or inheritance at any time would not be a matrimonial asset unless it was used as the matrimonial home or was substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage. As mentioned above at [10], the terms of F’s will provided that the estate was to be distributed only upon F’s widow’s death or upon the date of distribution on 19 August 2004, whichever was earlier, and only to the named beneficiaries “as shall be living at the date of distribution”.  When parties stayed in the Inherited property from 1996 to May 2002, the property was owned by F up to his death on 19 August 1999, and after F’s death, the Husband’s estate title and interest in F’s estate had yet to vest in interest. The Husband’s estate title and interest in F’s estate was vested in interest only on the date of distribution on 19 August 2004. Further, the appropriation of the Inherited property to the Husband was effected via the 2012 Deed of Distribution, long after parties and their children moved out of the Inherited Property. The Inherited Property was not owned by the Husband at the relevant time and cannot be regarded as a matrimonial home or a matrimonial asset. I note that this finding that the Inherited Property is not a matrimonial asset for division is not the subject of appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I turn now to the Matrimonial Home.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Matrimonial Home</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The parties agreed that the Matrimonial Home, their matrimonial home, was the only matrimonial asset for division as they had agreed to exclude all other assets in their sole names.

</div> To decide on this narrow point of what would be a just and equitable division of the Matrimonial Home, I need only turn to the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1043, where the Court of Appeal laid down the following approach (at [17] and [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17     It is now axiomatic that the court’s power to divide matrimonial assets must be exercised in broad strokes, with the court determining what is just and equitable in the circumstances of each case. The philosophy underlying what is known as the “broad-brush approach” is that mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 … Using the structured approach, the court could first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an “uplift” to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, inter alia, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court therefore has to first determine the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions, followed by the ratio of their indirect contributions throughout the marriage. The average of the two ratios will then form the basis of the division of the matrimonial assets. This is in recognition of the idea that marriage is an equal cooperative partnership of efforts and equal acknowledgement must be awarded to spousal contributions whether in the economic or homemaking sphere (see <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 at [20]).

</div> Leaving the Husband’s golfing aside, I found it probable that during the time that the Husband was so employed, he would have had to spend quite some time on the job in KL. This would mean that not only during that period, but during the other times when the Husband was working and continuing to build up his career as a successful insurance executive in Singapore, the child care functions were largely borne by the Wife, especially during the children’s formative years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Second, I took into account both parties’ role as caregiver of the children over the years as the marriage faltered. Specifically, I considered that for a period of time, the Wife had left the matrimonial home in 2010 to 2012 to stay with her parents and thereafter, when the children were older, the Wife moved to Myanmar in February 2014 to work. At the latter time, the son was 17 years old and the daughter was 15 years old. During this period, the children stayed with the Husband at the Matrimonial Home and credit must be given to the Husband for his care of the children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Third, I considered the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party, a factor that was relevant under s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Women’s Charter. In this regard, the Wife alleged that she helped to look after F (who lived next door to them at that time), and in particular, helped to change F’s renal bags every six hours from 1998 onwards.

Therefore, I preferred the Husband’s evidence over that of the Wife’s in relation to the care of F and did not give weight to the Wife’s statements that she had helped to look after F (who died in 1999). It must also be remembered that the children were very young during that time and the Wife’s attention would have been mostly focused on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On the other hand, it was undisputed that the parties had taken in the Wife’s sister’s illegitimate daughter after her birth in August 2000 and the family took care of her until her mother had the financial means to take over caring for her.

These were two factors that I had taken into consideration in relation to the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Fourth, I considered how the parties had contributed to the household and children’s expenses over the years. It must be borne in mind that although the divorce was only filed on 5 November 2012, the parties started living separate lives by early 2007. This meant that the parties lived as a married couple for only about 11 years. It was not in dispute that the parties did not have a joint account. The Husband claimed that he had not given the Wife a monthly allowance because she had always been self-sufficient. He further alleged that he had offered the Wife a supplementary credit card but this was refused by the Wife.

</div>
</div>
</div> Given the history of the marriage and that the parties had started to live apart since 2007, albeit under one roof, I was of the view that the truth likely lay somewhere in between both parties’ accounts, and that the Wife did bear a share of the costs of the expenses for the household and the children. I also noted that the Husband paid for the renovation expenses although there was a dispute as to the amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the light of the above, and considering all the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the parties’ indirect contribution was 60:40 in favour of the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Final ratio for division</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Averaging the ratios of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions, I found that the overall ratio was 67.35:32.65 in favour of the Husband, which I rounded to 67:33. I proceeded to consider whether there was any need for an adjustment to ensure that the overall distribution of the matrimonial assets was just and equitable. First, I noted that the Husband would be paying for the son’s education in the United States of America when he begins his university education at Notre Dame University. According to the Husband, that will cost $400,000 for a four year education. I commend the Husband for willingly agreeing to bear the full cost of the son’s education. I note that he had also agreed to bear the costs of the daughter’s education and her maintenance expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, I also took into account the fact that the Wife had not sought to ask for maintenance and that each party had agreed for each to keep the assets in their own name. There was no need to go into the issue of the parties’ respective incomes or assets because they had agreed that the court was only required to decide on the division of the Matrimonial Home. I noted, however, from the documents produced by the Husband, particularly those in relation to the estate of F, that the value of that estate was fairly substantial as at February 2001.

</div> The Husband was one of the four beneficiaries to that estate and also a beneficiary to his mother’s estate (the mother was a beneficiary of F’s estate). One of the immovable properties appropriated as the Husband’s share of the estate was the Inherited Property, which was valued in 2001 at $1.45m. The Husband had estimated that the value of this property to be $3m in 2015. The Husband was also a shareholder of a family investment holding company. He stated that apart from his earnings from his insurance agency, he had additional sources of income from F’s estate, the family investment holding company and from the Inherited Property.

In light of the facts and circumstances of this case, this ratio represented a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, especially when it is considered that the parties agreed that the Matrimonial Home was the only asset liable for division and that the parties were to keep matrimonial assets in their sole names.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I therefore ordered that the Matrimonial Home be divided in the proportion of 67% for the Husband and 33% for the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I further ordered that the Husband was to notify the Wife or her counsel within six weeks from the date of my order if he wanted to take over the Wife’s interest in the property.
