</div> A significant portion of the Defendant’s written submissions was also directed at persuading the court that the Defendant was wrongly joined as a party to the Application and that costs should be ordered against the Claimant for dragging him into these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Distilling the Application to its essence yielded three issues for determination: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the applicability of s 4 of the CLPA;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the Application should be granted pursuant to the court’s inherent powers; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the Application should be granted on the basis of s 56(1) of the Trustees Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Trustees Act</span>”).</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: The applicability of s 4 of the CLPA  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Section 4 of the CLPA reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1) A <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">v</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">endor or purchaser of land</span>, or their representatives respectively, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> at any time or times, and from time to time, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">apply in a summary way to the court</span> by originating application intituled in the matter of this Act, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the matter of the contract of sale</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, in respect of</span> any requisitions or objections, or any claim for compensation, or <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any other question arising out of or connected with the contract </span>not being a question affecting the existence or validity of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The court shall <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">make such order upon the application as seems just</span>, and shall order how and by whom all or any of the costs of and incident to the application shall be borne and paid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the outset, I harboured doubts as to the relevance of this provision to the Application. The Claimant offered no authority for his assertion that s 4 of the CLPA empowered the court to override the terms of the Will and sanction the completion of the sale, proffering only the bald assertion that a “plain reading” of the provision showed this to be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Defendant, while supporting the Claimant’s position that the court could (and should) sanction the sale, conceded that the court’s power to do so did not flow from s 4 of the CLPA. The Defendant referred to the case of <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Tippett’s and Newbould’s Contract</span> (1887) 37 Ch D 444 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tippett</span>”) (cited in <span class="font-italic">Tan Han Yong v Kwangtung Provincial Bank</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 255 at [18]). In <span class="font-italic">Tippett</span>, the vendor contracted to sell a leasehold interest which, pursuant to a will, had been vested in trustees for her benefit. Following objections by the purchaser, the vendor took out an application under s 9 of the United Kingdom (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">UK</span>”) Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874 (c. 78) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> VPA</span>”), which is identical in all material aspects to s 4 of the CLPA, to clarify whether there was a restraint on anticipation affecting the purchase money. In other words, the issue in that case was simply whether the purchase monies were to be paid to the vendor or to the trustees. The English Court of Appeal ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to invoke that statutory provision to determine this issue, given that the existence of such a restraint did not concern the property’s purchaser. Instead, the court granted the vendor leave to amend her application to an originating summons seeking the court’s construction of the will that had bequeathed the property to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I agreed with the Defendant that s 4 of the CLPA was inapplicable to the present Application. The express wording of s 4(1) of the CLPA centres on the <span class="font-italic">contract </span>of sale, empowering the court to make an order on any question arising out of or connected with that contract (not being a question affecting the contract’s validity or existence). In the English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">In re Hughes and Ashley’s Contract </span>[1900] 2 Ch 595, an application was brought under s 9 of the UK VPA by the vendors of a parcel of land, seeking (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) a declaration that the contract of sale did not confer upon the purchaser a right of way across the adjacent parcel of land owned by one of the vendors. The court ruled against the vendors on this point, finding that the purchaser did obtain such a right under the contact of sale. In finding that the vendors’ application had properly been made under the UK VPA, Collins LJ observed (at 603–604) that the policy of this statute was to provide applicants with: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a cheap and easy method of obtaining a decision on points which may <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">arise in</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">carrying out contracts</span>, instead of the parties being put to the expense of an action for specific performance. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he present question of the right of way is one that depends upon the construction of the contract as it stands; and I think … that the vendors were right in making their application. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In contrast, the focal point of the Application was not on the contract of sale, but on the <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic">ill</span> which conferred title to the item sought to be sold. In that sense, the present case was similar to <span class="font-italic">Tippett</span>, where the court held that the construction of the underlying testamentary instrument was not merely an incidental point arising from the execution of the proposed contract to sell the item bequeathed. Rather, the question of whether the Will allowed the Claimant to sell the Property in the first place was a <span class="font-italic">threshold </span><span class="font-italic">issue</span>, which had to be tackled independently of any proposed contract of sale that might come along. The construction of the Will could thus not be regarded as something “arising out of or connected with” the contract of sale, notwithstanding the downstream impact which that construction would have on whether the contract of sale could even be performed. Relying on s 4 of the CLPA to ask the court to override the Will and thereby facilitate the contract of sale would be for the tail to wag the dog.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Defendant submitted that any decision by the court to sanction the sale would have to be grounded on the court’s inherent jurisdiction instead. It is to this which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Application should be granted pursuant to the court’s inherent powers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy and others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and others</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 434 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy</span>”), the Court of Appeal recognised (at [75]) that the court can exercise its inherent jurisdiction to vary the terms of a trust, mainly in circumstances such as unforeseen emergencies in which the trustees had no power under the trust to carry out an act or transaction, where it would be expedient in the interest of the trust that the trustees be allowed to carry out that act or transaction. More recently, the Court of Appeal took the opportunity to clarify how the words “inherent jurisdiction”, employed by our courts in various decisions, may be more precisely termed “inherent powers” when the subject concerned not so much the court’s jurisdiction or authority to hear a matter but rather its capacity to grant certain orders or reliefs: see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario</span> [2013] 3 SLR 258 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span>”) at [32]–[41]. In that vein, I have referred to the subject of discussion here as “inherent powers” rather than “inherent jurisdiction”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In the present case, the Claimant sought to overcome the obstacle posed by cl 8(i) of the Will by painting a rather pressing picture:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sale price of $4.45m offered by the Defendant was the highest amongst all the transactions in the last three years for the condominium development in which the Property was situated.

As a mortgagee exercising the power of sale, UOB would be subject to a duty to properly advertise the sale and take reasonable care to obtain the true market value of the Property at the time of sale: see <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 at [119]. Further, no reasons were provided as to why the Defendant, if he was truly interested in the Property, could not partake in a sale by UOB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Ultimately, the court’s inherent powers should be exercised to give effect to the intentions of the settlor or testator, as expressed in the trust instrument or will, and not used to arrogate to the court any overriding power to disregard or rewrite the instrument’s clauses. In <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy</span>, the Court of Appeal cited (at [72]) the observations of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">In re Downshire Settled Estates; In re Chapman’s Settlement Trusts; In re Blackwell’s Settlement Trusts</span> [1953] Ch 218 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Downshire Settled Estates</span>”), where Evershed MR and Romer LJ remarked (at 234):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[O]ne thing is, we think, clear: just as the court has always insisted on the due and proper observance by trustees of the terms of their trusts, so also will it in its own orders depart as little as possible from the strict letter of the trust instrument … The general rule, as we have said, is that the court will give effect, as it requires the trustees themselves to do, to the intentions of a settler as expressed in the trust instrument, and has not arrogated to itself any overriding power to disregard or re-write the trusts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I thus took the view that this was not an appropriate case for me to exercise the court’s inherent powers to sanction completion of the sale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the Application should be granted on the basis of s 56(1) of the Trustees Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Apart from the court’s inherent powers, there is yet another source of power which allows the court to supplement the terms of a trust. This is found in s 56(1) of the Trustees Act, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">56.</span>—(1) Where in the management or administration of any property vested in trustees, any sale, lease, mortgage, surrender, release, or other disposition, or any purchase, investment, acquisition, expenditure, or other transaction, is in the opinion of the court expedient, but the same cannot be effected by reason of the absence of any power for that purpose vested in the trustees by the trust instrument (if any) or by law, the court may — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  by order confer upon the trustees, either generally or in any particular instance, the necessary power for the purpose, on any terms, and subject to any provisions and conditions that the court thinks fit; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  direct in what manner any money authorised to be expended and the costs of any transaction are to be paid or borne as between capital and income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Unlike the inherent powers of the court, which tend to be exercised to vary trusts in instances of unforeseen emergencies, this provision appears to be somewhat broader in scope, allowing the court to supplement gaps in the trustee’s powers, even outside of pressing exigencies. In <span class="font-italic">Downshire Settled Estates</span>, the English Court of Appeal set out the basic elements for the application of s 57 of the UK Trustees Act 1925 (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 56 of the Trustees Act). Specifically, Evershed MR and Romer LJ remarked (at 244–245): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to us that the section envisages, on analysis: (i) an act unauthorised by a trust instrument, (ii) to be effected by the trustees thereof, (iii) in the management or administration of the trust property, (iv) which the court will empower them to perform, (v) if in its opinion the act is expedient. It is, we think, mainly on the proper interpretation of the phrase ‘management or administration,’ in the context in which it appears, that the question at issue primarily depends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Evershed MR and Romer LJ also explained the purport of the UK statutory provision, to show how it cohered with the court’s inherent powers (at 248):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the object of section 57 was to secure that trust property should be managed as advantageously as possible in the interests of the beneficiaries and, with that object in view, to authorize specific dealings with the property which the court might have felt itself unable to sanction under the inherent jurisdiction, either because no actual ‘emergency’ had arisen or because of inability to show that the position which called for intervention was one which the creator of the trust could not reasonably have foreseen; <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but it was no part of the legislative aim to disturb the rule that the court will not rewrite a trust, or to add to such exceptions to that rule as had already found their way into the inherent jurisdiction.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The last portion of the section quoted above clearly indicates that application of the UK provision was not without limits. In <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy</span>, the Court of Appeal had occasion to consider s 59(1) of the Trustees Act 1967 (1985 Rev Ed), which was subsequently renumbered to s 56(1) of the Trustees Act in force today. The Court of Appeal endorsed the opinions voiced by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Downshire Settled Estates</span> and held that while the provision in the Trustees Act may be used to empower trustees to do what the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">absence of power </span>impedes them from doing, it cannot be used to authorise acts or transactions that are <span class="font-italic">expressly forbidden</span> by the trust instrument (at [78] and [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As such, in the present case, s 56(1) of the Trustees Act cannot be prayed in aid of a sale within three years of the Testatrix’s demise, as this has been expressly forbidden by cl 8(i) of the Will. In contending that it could, the Defendant cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy v Leo Teng Kit</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 636 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Leo Teng Choy</span>”). That case involved a house that had been bequeathed under a will containing a stipulation that the house could not be sold unless all four beneficiaries (who were the sons of the testator) consented to the sale. There arose a deadlock between the four beneficiaries, with one of them refusing to consent to the sale and remaining in the house after the other three beneficiaries had all moved out. The other three beneficiaries thus brought an application for a court order to sell the house. Notwithstanding the lack of consensus between the four beneficiaries, the Court of Appeal exercised the power under s 56(1) of the Trustees Act and ordered the sale of the house. In doing so, the court assessed (at [26]) that the <span class="font-italic">overriding consideration</span> of the testator was to allow all four of his sons to benefit equally from his estate – sanctioning the sale would advance the testator’s intent in that regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Defendant thus relied on <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy</span> to argue that the court could countermand the three-year moratorium imposed by cl 8(i) of the Will if this would further the Testatrix’s overriding intention. The Defendant then sought to tease out that intention, suggesting that cl 8(a) clearly contemplated that the Testatrix’s objective was to achieve a profit from the realisation of the estate. The Defendant pointed out that the prohibition against a sale within three years of the Testatrix’s demise was subject to the exception (set out in 8(i)(ii) of the Will) of the Property being acquired by an <span class="font-italic">en bloc</span> sale. The Defendant argued that in view of how <span class="font-italic">en bloc</span> sales are clearly understood to reap higher profits for the property owner, one could deduce that the Testatrix must have had profit maximization as a goal, given that she took pains to specifically list <span class="font-italic">en bloc</span> sales as an exception to the three-year moratorium.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I remained unconvinced. The facts and holding in <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy</span> were quite specific. The court held that the state of affairs, where one son was living in the house and preventing his brothers from selling it, clearly frustrated the testator’s intention of benefitting his four sons equally. The court remarked (at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our opinion, the court in sanctioning the sale would not only not be acting contrary to the directions expressed in the will, but would, in fact, be carrying out the overriding intention of the testator. Indeed, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to allow the appellant to enjoy the property solely would run counter to what was the basic intention implicit in his will</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In contrast, I could not discern any “overriding intention” within the Will that would be frustrated by adherence to the three-year moratorium. What the Defendant was effectively suggesting was that the Testatrix intended to maximise profits from the realisation of her estate and, since the Defendant appeared to be offering a good price, allowing the sale to the Defendant would further that intent and thereby warrant overriding cl 8. To my mind, this was an extrapolation which had to be approached with some circumspection. It would be unusual for any testator to intend that his estate be realised at a loss. By and large, one could expect testators to prefer their estates to be realised in a fashion that yields the best value. Be that as it may, this natural state of affairs cannot in and of itself provide grounds for rewriting the will. Otherwise, explicit restrictions by testators may be snubbed as a matter of course every time a good deal comes along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In any case, the Defendant had not proven that allowing the sale was the only way to preserve the value of the estate. As explained at [22(b)] above, the Claimant failed to sufficiently establish why a sale by the mortgagee would necessarily fetch a lower price than that offered by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I also note that <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy</span> could be distinguished from the facts of the Application before me. In <span class="font-italic">Leo Teng Choy</span>, the relevant clause standing in the way of the sale read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I direct that my said land and house … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall not be sold, rented out or in any way converted into cash unless and until unanimously agreed upon by my said sons</span> … in which event the net proceeds of sale from the said land and house shall be distributed to my said sons in equal shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In contrast, the present case involves a prohibition worded in far more absolute terms: cl 8(i) stated that “[<span class="font-italic">u</span>]<span class="font-italic">nder no circumstances</span>” was there to be a sale of the Property within three years of the Testatrix’s death. The unequivocal character of the prohibition was reinforced by its repetition in cl 8(a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In his affidavit, the Claimant surmised that the Testatrix may have inserted the three-year moratorium because she was under the misapprehension that she could avoid the payment of estate duty by delaying the sale for three years.

</div> However, apart from this bare surmise, there were no facts on record which would support such a conjecture.
