Shengwang is not party to the contracts for the Goods, and has no standing to bring the claim.

</div> Tanfull’s role was simply that of an exporter, shipper, and customs agent. At no time did Tanfull contract in its own name to either buy the Goods from Shengwang, or sell them to Triple D.

</div> In this regard, Shengwang’s position is that the P-T Invoices and the Invoices are not determinative of the existence of two separate sets of contracts between itself and Tanfull, and between Tanfull and Triple D.

</div> Consequently, Shengwang is not the right party to sue Triple D for breach of contract. Triple D argues that the P-T Invoices and the Invoices, either themselves constitute two separate sets of contracts, or serve as strong evidence that the Goods were sold to Tanfull by Shengwang and then by Tanfull to Triple D in two sets of legally separate transactions.

Subsumed within this is the question of the role of Tanfull in the transactions. There are other arguments raised by the parties concerning the principal-agent relationship between Shengwang and Tanfull, as well as an objection by Shengwang that Triple D has not pleaded various positions it now relies on.

In a contractual claim, this would include the very basis of the agreement upon which the claim is founded: <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART and another</span> [2015] SGHC 78 (“<span class="font-italic">ARS</span>”) at [47]. However, the evidential burden, or the tactical onus to contradict, weaken, or explain away evidence that has been led, may shift from one party to another: <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 (“<span class="font-italic">Rabobank</span>”) at [30], citing <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [58].

Apart from denying this, Triple D also claims that Tanfull was the seller of the Goods. This is a positive claim for Triple D to prove. However, even if Triple D fails to do so, it does not mean that Shengwang succeeds in its claim. A trier of fact is not bound to choose between the assertions of either party. If the state of the evidence is unsatisfactory, the court may simply find that Shengwang has failed to discharge the burden of proof: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock v Teo Cher Koon and another and another appeal </span>[2022] 2 SLR 314 at [31].

</div> the question is whether given the terms of the EAA, as a matter of fact, it is more likely that Shengwang or Tanfull contracted with Triple D for the Goods. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This being the case, I find that the EAA is admissible, and I also find that it provides strong support for Shengwang’s case. While the existence of the EAA does not definitively prove that Shengwang is the contracting party in relation to the Goods, it strongly suggests that the general nature of the working relationship between Shengwang and Tanfull was that Shengwang would enter into contracts for the sale of ceiling fan products with Triple D, and Tanfull would handle the export, taxes, customs clearance, arrangements for the delivery of the products, and the collection of payments. This in turn makes it more likely that the specific contracts for purchase of the Goods by Triple D were entered into with Shengwang, rather than with Tanfull. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Emails concerning the shipments of the Goods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I now turn to the evidence concerning the shipping of the Goods.

ZJCL treated the Goods as belonging to Shengwang and Mr Yin, rather than to Tanfull (despite the contents of the Invoices and the packing lists referred to in the emails). This is consistent with Shengwang’s case that Tanfull was only an exporter, and that it had never purchased the Goods from Shengwang in any meaningful sense such that it could in turn “re-sell” them to Triple D in separate transactions to which Shengwang was not party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Triple D’s response to this argument is that “Tanfull was referring to the shipment of goods by [Shengwang] to Tanfull, which Tanfull in turn resold to [Triple D]”, and “[i]t is undisputed that the actual documents in the email … were from Tanfull to [Triple D] and not [Shengwang] to [Triple D]”.

</div> I understand this to mean that the emails were simply identifying the Goods with reference to their source, and that their doing so should not be taken as indicative of who Ms Mini understood as the legal owner of the Goods at the material time. I accept that a genuine reseller <span class="font-italic">might</span> possibly choose to identify goods in such a manner. However, given that ZJCL chose to identify each shipment of the Goods specifically with reference to Shengwang, rather than by reference to their contents or to Tanfull, the <span class="font-italic">more</span> plausible explanation is that ZJCL was operating on the basis that, for all intents and purposes, the Goods sold to Triple D belonged to Shengwang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I make one further observation in connection with Ms Mini’s emails. Regardless of what might or might not be inferred about the legal ownership of the Goods at the material time, the contents of the emails make quite clear that the <span class="font-italic">source</span> of the Goods was Shengwang. Given that these emails were disclosed to Shengwang <span class="font-italic">by </span><span class="font-italic">Triple D, </span>it cannot seriously be doubted that Triple D was aware of their existence and their contents.

I deal with the main ones. First, Triple D takes issue with the fact that Mr Yin first claimed that Shengwang could not receive large remittances, but then later testified that it “can also collect large amount”.

</div> In this instance, I agree that on the face of the record, there does appear to be an inconsistency in what Mr Yin has testified. However, when pressed on this point, Mr Yin clarified that the reason why Shengwang did not continue to receive remittances directly from Triple D was not because it “could not” in the same sense that Mr Yin could not receive large amounts, but because of their lack of an export permit.

</div> I reject this argument.

</div> meant this in the strict sense of formally applying for the refund in Shengwang’s name or on its behalf. Rather, what I take him as saying is simply that, in the course of exporting Shengwang’s products, Tanfull would generally be the one assisting with the process of applying for tax refunds. This would be consistent with clause 6.6 of the EAA, which provides that:

Otherwise, if Shengwang was the one who would directly receive the refund, then there would be no need to provide for it to bear the loss in a situation where that refund was not obtained and the tax was levied on Tanfull. I therefore do not see anything inherently implausible or contradictory in Mr Yin’s explanation in so far as it concerns export taxes and Tanfull’s role in this. As neither party has provided any evidence on whether such an arrangement is in fact possible or permissible under Chinese law, there is no basis for me to reject it out of hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I should add that Triple D also levels a similar criticism against Mr Yin’s account of how the arrangement with Tanfull affected Shengwang’s <span class="font-italic">corporate income</span> tax obligations.

</div> However, when it was suggested to him that this would lead to any one shipment of Goods being taxed twice, given that both Shengwang and Tanfull would issue invoices in respect of any one shipment, Mr Yin’s response was that Tanfull was simply “doing the export based on our amount”, and that the invoices which were relevant to calculation of corporate income tax were “tax invoices of the standard e-tax invoices by the China Tax Bureau”, rather than those issued by Shengwang to Tanfull or Tanfull to Triple D.

Mr Yin made no other mention of any parallel sets of invoices, either in his evidence or at trial, nor did the Plaintiff’s Counsel take up this point in further examination. However, neither did the Defendant’s Counsel, despite having had the opportunity to conduct further cross-examination immediately after this point was brought up.

</div> This being the case, and without the benefit of any evidence on the law on Chinese corporate income tax, I can only form a view on whether Mr Yin’s explanation is inherently plausible. While his explanation is again not nearly as clear as would have been desirable, I do not think it inherently implausible that different government agencies may adopt different types of documentation, and that one may have its own system of invoices while another relies on those issued by the exporting party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I should add that it is not disputed that the prices of the Goods as listed in the Invoice are the same prices as listed in the P-T Invoices.

</div> According to Shengwang, this strengthens the inference that Tanfull could not have been reselling the Goods in its own right, as it would make no commercial sense for Tanfull to sell the Goods at exactly the same price at which it bought them with no markup whatsoever.

</div> Triple D argues that this fact is simply a business decision that is not relevant in the present case, and that all that matters is that since Tanfull issued the invoices for the Goods to Triple D, this must mean that it owned the Goods and sold them to Triple D.

All else being equal, the commercial logic of the transaction for all parties, including Tanfull, <span class="font-italic">is</span> relevant to the question of whether it was more likely that Tanfull was reselling the Goods and thus contracting directly with Triple D, or whether it was simply exporting the Goods on behalf of Shengwang who had been the one to contract with Triple D. This being the case, I agree with Shengwang that the identical prices listed in both sets of invoices make it more likely that Tanfull was not dealing with Triple D as a reseller of the Goods, but rather as a provider of export and export-related services. It makes no sense for Tanfull to be selling the Goods at the same price at which it bought them if its business was genuinely that of reselling ceiling fan Goods from Shengwang to Triple D. However, it makes perfect sense if their business model was simply to provide export and export-related services, for which they would receive a fee. This is indeed precisely what is provided for in the EAA, which provides that Tanfull would receive an “agency fee” for its services, and also that Tanfull would transfer payments received from Triple D to an account designated by Shengwang within three days of receiving it.

Besides the P-T Invoices (and perhaps the packing lists), for which Shengwang has in my view provided a satisfactory explanation, there is no other evidence suggesting that Tanfull purchased the Goods from Shengwang. Furthermore, as I shall explain later at [72], there is also no credible evidence that Triple D ordered the Goods from Tanfull. Indeed, Triple D's failure to adduce any credible evidence of any underlying contracts with Tanfull corresponding with the Invoices gives rise to serious doubts about its case. Based on these reasons, I am of the view that the Invoices do not form direct contracts between Tanfull and Triple D, and that little if any weight should be accorded to them as evidence of any purported direct contracts between Tanfull and Triple D. I make similar findings in relation to the P-T Invoices. They are not contracts, and they are not sufficient evidence to show that Shengwang had sold the Goods to Tanfull outright. In reaching these findings, I am fortified by my analysis thus far on various aspects of the evidence above, as well as the further discussion below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other transactions after the Export Agency Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Shengwang also adduced evidence to show that, even after the introduction of Tanfull into the logistical chain in 2020, it would <span class="font-italic">generally</span> contract or otherwise deal directly with Triple D.

Mr Phua then replies by saying that he has not yet received the remittance advice from the finance house. However, he shortly thereafter sends what appears to be a screenshot of a confirmation of Triple D’s purchase of a sum of Chinese currency, which states that upon clearance of the “SGD funds”, the purchased sum of “CNH 691,260.00” would be transferred to Tanfull.

</div> In other words, even after Tanfull had begun receiving payment for the ceiling fan products it delivered to Triple D, Shengwang continued to communicate directly with Triple D. Clearly, Shengwang retained an interest in Triple D’s payments to Tanfull, and in turn, this supports its case that it had directly contracted with Triple D, rather than selling its Goods outright to Tanfull to be resold to Triple D in an entirely separate transaction in which it had no interest whatsoever. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Triple D attempts to reconcile the 2021 WeChat exchange with its claim that it contracted to purchase the Goods with Tanfull and not Shengwang by suggesting that “if Tanfull were reselling [Shengwang’s] goods, it made sense for [Shengwang] to remind [Triple D] to make payment so that Tanfull would in turn pay [Shengwang] for the purchase of the goods”.

</div> In short, its argument is that notwithstanding the fact that Shengwang had no <span class="font-italic">legal</span> interest in the alleged sale and purchase contract between Tanfull and Triple D, it had a <span class="font-italic">practical commercial</span> interest in Triple D making payment to Tanfull, because this was a necessary prerequisite to Shengwang getting paid by Tanfull. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, when cross-examined on the 2021 WeChat exchange, Mr Phua conceded that the reason why Mr Yin wanted to know whether payment had been made to Tanfull was “because the goods were ordered from Shengwang by [Triple D]”.

</div> Thus, on Mr Phua’s own account, there were at least two instances in which Shengwang and Triple D had continued to contract directly with each other for the ceiling fan products even after Tanfull had begun handling deliveries and receiving payment. This seriously undermines Triple D’s weak attempt to reconcile the 2021 WeChat exchange with its claim that Shengwang’s sales of the Goods to Tanfull were entirely distinct transactions from Tanfull’s subsequent sales of the Goods to Triple D. More importantly, it also lends further support to Shengwang’s claim that the Goods were received by Triple D pursuant to similar contracts with Shengwang. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I also observe that Mr Phua’s admission that the ceiling fan products involved in the 2021 WeChat exchange were ordered from Shengwang by Triple D, and the contents of the 2021 WeChat exchange itself, clearly demonstrate that he was fully aware that the products Triple D received from Tanfull originated from Shengwang. This is wholly inconsistent with the claim that “[Tanfull] supply the goods to me, but as to where they get the goods from, that one, I wouldn’t know”.

Mr Phua’s refusal to admit that the letter was sent after the arrival of the first two shipments of the Goods flies in the face of the evidence and is wholly without merit, as is his belated refusal to accept that the 19 May Letter was in fact sent on 19 May 2021, notwithstanding the timestamp on the WeChat screenshot which clearly shows this to be the case. I also find it very unlikely that Mr Phua would take two full years to follow up on defective orders received directly from Shengwang in 2019.

</div> are both inconsistent with   Triple D’s suggestion that it was genuinely trying to sell Shengwang remote controllers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 That being the case, the 19 May Letter and the Shengwang-10 Contract clearly show that Triple D was dealing with Shengwang as its contractual counterparty, and seeking to hold it responsible for defects in products received from Tanfull. Even if the subject matter of the 19 May Letter did not relate to the Goods themselves, both the 19 May Letter and the Shengwang-10 Contract lend further support to Shengwang’s claim that Shengwang continued to contract directly with Triple D even after Tanfull took over the export of Shengwang’s products. As with the 2021 WeChat exchange, this in turn makes it more likely that the Goods were received pursuant to such contracts made with Shengwang. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Phua’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shengwang’s refusal to sell to Triple D </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I now turn to examine Mr Phua’s evidence more closely. As noted above at [5], it is not disputed that Triple D stopped receiving ceiling fan products directly from Shengwang and started receiving them from Tanfull sometime in or around July 2020. Triple D claims that this switch occurred because Shengwang had decided that it would no longer sell its products to Triple D, and had notified Triple D accordingly. Thereafter, it began buying Goods from Tanfull and making payments to Tanfull directly.

</div> This being the case, Shengwang’s alleged cessation of supply of even just this one series of ceiling fan products would surely have been a commercially significant event for Triple D, making it extremely unlikely that Triple D would have reacted in the nonchalant manner which Mr Phua claimed it did, or that Mr Phua would have forgotten almost all of the details of that termination. Absent any claim, let alone evidence, that there was any major disagreement between the parties at the material time, it is also inexplicable to me why, as claimed by Mr Phua, Shengwang would bring the business relationship to a sudden end. Coupled with the other issues with Mr Phua’s credibility, I decline to accord much weight to this aspect of his testimony. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Source of Tanfull’s ceiling fan products </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Related to the above, Mr Phua made no attempt to explain how Triple D seamlessly secured Tanfull to be its supplier of the very same ceiling fan products that Shengwang used to supply. In this connection, it bears remembering that Tanfull is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a manufacturer of ceiling fan products. Indeed, as discussed above at [40] and [62], Mr Phua’s claim that Triple D did not know Tanfull’s source of the ceiling fan products at all is completely discredited by the contemporaneous documentary evidence in the form of Ms Mini’s emails and the 2021 WeChat exchange. Instead, it seems to me that it was Mr Yin’s evidence, that Triple D continued to deal with Shengwang albeit with the interposition of Tanfull as the export agent, which carried the greater ring of truth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Orders for the Goods placed over the phone </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 To buttress its claim that it placed the orders for the Goods directly with Tanfull, Triple D relies on Mr Phua’s oral account of how he placed these orders.

</div> It could not possibly have escaped Triple D’s attention that <span class="font-italic">any </span>evidence in support of its position that Triple D contracted directly with Tanfull would be critical. Mr Phua’s last-ditch attempt to patch this gap in Triple D’s case is completely unconvincing. I dismissed this aspect of Mr Phua’s testimony as an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To sum up, having considered the totality of the evidence, I accept Mr Yin’s evidence that Mr Zheng placed orders for the Goods with Mr Yin, and that as the contracting party, Shengwang supplied the Goods. In this process, Tanfull dealt with the export arrangements, including issuing invoices to Triple D for payment. Mr Yin’s evidence is supported by the EAA which sets out Tanfull’s role as an agent for export and export-related services, and the emails from Ms Mini linking the shipments of the Goods to Shengwang (rather than Tanfull). Indeed, it seems to me that the transactions were carried out in accordance with the terms of the EAA. Further, there is also evidence to show that Shengwang had continued to contract directly with Triple D even after Tanfull entered the picture after mid-2020, as would be consistent with Mr Yin’s testimony that this was the case in respect of the Goods. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In contrast, I do not consider the P-T Invoices or the Invoices to constitute contracts between Shengwang and Tanfull, and Tanfull and Shengwang respectively. These two sets of invoices are also of limited assistance to Triple D in establishing the existence of corresponding contractual relationships, given Shengwang’s explanation for why they were issued. What support they do provide for Triple D’s case is outweighed by the evidence favouring Shengwang’s case. Key aspects of Mr Phua’s testimony are unbelievable or inconsistent with the documentary evidence. In particular, I find Mr Phua’s belated evidence that he placed the orders with Chai Yuen of Tanfull incredible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Thus, I find that Triple D had directly contracted with Shengwang for Shengwang to sell and supply the Goods. These Goods were delivered to Triple D, and Triple D has failed to make full payment. As Shengwang has succeeded in proving its case, I see no need to deal with any other arguments raised by the parties, as alluded to at [12] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Accordingly, I grant judgment in the sum of CNY1,885,630.00 to Shengwang. I also allow interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of writ to date of judgment.
