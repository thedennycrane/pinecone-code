        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These were appeals by both Norwest Holdings Pte
                    Ltd (“Norwest”) and Newport Mining Ltd (“Newport”)
                    (respectively, “CA 151/2009” and
                    “CA 153/2009”) against the decision of the trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) in Suit No 28 of 2009 (see <em>Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Newport Mining Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 3 SLR 956 (“the GD”)) concerning the sale by the
                    liquidator of Norwest of the entire share capital of its wholly-owned subsidiary
                    Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd (“Norwest Chemicals”) to Newport. The
                    Judge dismissed Norwest’s claim for S$5.6475m as damages arising from
                    Newport’s failure to complete the purchase of the shares and allowed
                    Newport’s counterclaim for recovery of the S$102,500 deposit it had placed
                    with Norwest. Norwest appealed against the entirety of the Judge’s
                    decision whilst Newport appealed against the Judge’s specific finding that
                    there was a binding contract between Newport and Norwest for the sale and
                    purchase of the entire share capital of Norwest Chemicals (“the
                    Shares”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing submissions from both parties, we
                    were satisfied that there was no binding contract between Newport and Norwest
                    and that Newport was therefore under no obligation to complete the purchase of
                    the Shares. That being the case, we dismissed Norwest’s appeal in
                    CA 151/2009 and allowed Newport’s appeal in CA 153/2009. Even
                    though we arrived at the same result as the Judge below, we respectfully
                    differed in terms of the reasoning. We now set out below the detailed grounds
                    for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Norwest is a company incorporated in Singapore.
                    It was placed under compulsory liquidation on 11 January 2008 pursuant to
                    an order of court. Mr Lai Seng Kwoon (“the Liquidator”) was
                    appointed the sole liquidator of Norwest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Norwest Chemicals is a wholly-owned subsidiary
                    of Norwest. At the material time Norwest Chemicals owned 100% of the share
                    capital of Sichuan Mianzhu Norwest Phosphate Chemical Company Limited
                    (“Norwest China”), a company incorporated in the People’s
                    Republic of China (“China”). Norwest China owns a 30,000 mtpa
                        (<em>ie</em>, metric tonnes per annum) sodium and
                    potassium phosphate production facility and a 6,000 mtpa facility for acid
                    production located in the Sichuan province in China (“Production
                    Facilities”) as well as the mining rights to two phosphate rock mines
                    (“the Mines”) for a period up to 2015 (collectively referred to as
                    the “Chinese Business”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Newport is an Australian publicly listed company
                    which was at the material time actively looking to acquire phosphate assets. In
                    response to an information memorandum prepared by the Liquidator (“the
                    Information Memorandum”) for the intended sale of the entire share
                    capital of Norwest Chemicals, Taylor Collison Limited (“Taylor
                    Collison”), acting as sharebrokers and investment advisers to Newport,
                    indicated Newport’s interest in acquiring the Shares in a letter dated
                    27 February 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> addressed to the
                Liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The purpose of the Information
                        Memorandum<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> prepared by the Liquidator in
                    relation to the proposed sale of the Shares was to inform interested buyers of
                    the conditions of the proposed sale (on an “as is where is” basis)
                    so that those interested buyers could submit an Expression of Interest and
                    “non-binding offer” to the Liquidator and to allow the Liquidator
                    to determine which parties would be involved in the second stage of due
                    diligence in order to finalise the sale process. Interested buyers had to carry
                    out independent investigations at their own expense and make their own
                    independent assessment of the potential value of Norwest Chemicals. It was
                    further stated in the Information Memorandum (at para 3.0) that the
                    intention of the Liquidator was to sell Norwest Chemicals together with Norwest
                    China in its “present state and condition on an ‘as is, where
                    is’ basis and subject to a Sale and Purchase
                        Agreement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In a letter dated 4 April 2008, Taylor
                    Collison submitted an Expression of Interest (in the form of Appendix A to
                    the Information Memorandum) to the Liquidator, making an offer of S$5.5m for the
                    Shares on behalf of Newport.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 2 May 2008, Newport submitted a Firm
                    Letter of Offer (in the form of Appendix B to the Information Memorandum)
                    (“First Firm Letter of Offer”), offering to purchase the Shares
                    for S$10m. This was followed by a subsequent Firm Letter of Offer dated
                    9 May 2008 (“Second Firm Letter of Offer”), increasing the
                    offer to S$10.25m. The material portions of the Second Firm Letter of Offer read

                    (“Acceptance Letter”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In the Acceptance Letter, the
                    Liquidator stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We hereby accept your offer of Singapore Dollars Ten Million Two Hundred
                        Fifty Thousand (SGD10,250,000) for all the shares that we hold in [Norwest
                        Chemicals]. A formal Sale and Purchase Agreement is to be negotiated and
                        executed between [Newport] and [Norwest]. As previously indicated, the sale
                        is on an “as is, where is” basis and we make no warranties,
                        representations or undertakings as regards the assets and liabilities of
                        [Norwest Chemicals] or its subsidiary [Norwest China].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the Acceptance Letter, the Liquidator also requested that Newport
                    provide an additional sum of S$47,500 to make up for the shortfall in the 1%
                    deposit (out of which Newport had already paid S$55,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Newport replied the following day, 13 May
                    2008, at 2.36pm, via email, thanking the Liquidator for his Acceptance Letter.
                    Newport also stated that it would work towards the deadline of 1 June 2008,
                    adhering to the revised timetable enclosed in a 10 April 2008
                        letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> from the
                    Liquidator to Taylor Collison, and requested the Liquidator to advise on the
                    condition of the “mine and plant” as well as any information with
                    respect to casualties and injuries amongst the staff and workers. On 14 May
                    2008 Newport transferred S$47,500 to Norwest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     No news regarding the damage caused by the
                    Sichuan Earthquake to the Chinese Business was forthcoming from the Liquidator.
                    The completion date of 1 June 2008 came but Newport did not complete the
                    purchase of the Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 2 June 2008, Norwest’s
                    solicitors sent a letter to Newport’s solicitors, stating that Newport had
                    failed to fulfil its contractual obligation to complete the purchase of the
                    Shares by 1 June 2008 and gave Newport a final extension of up to 4pm on
                    5 June 2008 to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The next day, on 3 June
                    2008, Newport’s solicitors replied, disavowing the existence of any
                    “binding and enforceable contract in place for the sale and
                    purchase” of the Shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By a letter dated 6 June 2008, Norwest
                    purported to accept Newport’s repudiation of the contract and gave notice
                    that it would be seeking to mitigate its loss by seeking alternative buyers for
                    the Shares. In August 2008, the Liquidator sold the Shares to Hwa Hong Edible
                    Oil Industries (“Hwa Hong”) for S$4.5m. Hwa Hong was the main
                    shareholder of Norwest (holding 49.5% of Norwest shares) and also the main
                    creditor which put Norwest in liquidation because of unpaid management fees to
                    the tune of S$4.9m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In January 2009, Norwest commenced this suit
                    against Newport claiming damages for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge dismissed Norwest’s claim for
                    damages and allowed Newport’s counterclaim for the deposit. In arriving at
                    this conclusion, she made the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     When Norwest accepted
                        Newport’s Second Firm Letter of Offer, parties had agreed on the
                        price, subject-matter and the risk and had therefore reached substantial
                        agreement. The contract was only incomplete as to the mechanics of the sale
                        but that did not prevent any contract from coming into existence (at
                            [31] of the
                    GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Newport
                        evinced an intention to enter into legal relations immediately upon
                        Norwest’s acceptance of the Second Firm Letter of Offer (at [38] of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The subject-matter of the contract was
                        the Chinese Business, not the Shares <em>in vacuo</em>.
                        After the Sichuan Earthquake, the Shares did not present the same value as
                        offered on 9 May 2008 and the Liquidator was not able to deliver the
                        value that was bargained for when Newport made the offer in the Second Firm
                        Letter of Offer (at [43] of the GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     Since Newport would not be receiving what it offered to
                        buy, it was not bound to accept the Shares or make payment (at [50] of the
                        GD);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     As the
                        change in the Chinese Business as a result of the Sichuan Earthquake was
                        unknown to both Newport and Norwest at the time the Acceptance Letter was
                        sent, the parties were operating under a common mistake as to the
                        subject-matter of the contract (<em>viz</em>, control
                        over the Chinese Business), which resulted in the contract being void
                            <em>ab initio</em> (at [67] of the GD);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     Newport was
                        entitled to recover the 1% deposit it placed with Norwest due to the total
                        failure of consideration from the latter (at [71] of the
                GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In these appeals, Norwest essentially made the
                    following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Second Firm Letter of Offer was
                        not “subject to contract” as there were very strong and
                        exceptional reasons not to give the phrase “subject to
                        contract” its <em>prima facie</em> meaning. In
                        any case, following Norwest’s acceptance of Newport’s offer, the
                        essential terms of the contract had been agreed upon and a contract had been
                        concluded between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The subject matter of the contract was the Shares, which
                        were not damaged or destroyed by the Sichuan Earthquake in any way. Since
                        Norwest was ready and willing to perform its obligation to sell the Shares,
                        in failing to tender the purchase price Newport had acted in breach of its
                        obligations under the contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     It is not part of Singapore law that a condition
                        precedent is implied by law in all offers that the subject matter of the
                        contract must remain materially and substantially unchanged at the time of
                        acceptance, failing which the offer would be incapable of being accepted;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     On
                        Newport’s pleaded case regarding the rules set out in the Information
                        Memorandum, Norwest was not obliged to return the 1%
                deposit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In response, Newport contended that there was
                        <em>no binding legal contract</em> between Norwest and
                    Newport for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Second Firm Letter of Offer was
                        “subject to contract” and was not a legally binding offer that
                        could be accepted by Norwest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if the Second Firm Letter of Offer constituted a
                        legally binding offer, it lapsed after the underlying business of Norwest
                        China was destroyed by the Sichuan Earthquake, and could no longer be
                        capable of acceptance;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if there was a binding contract between the parties,
                        Norwest was unable to perform the contract as the Production Facilities and
                        the Mines had been severely damaged by the Sichuan Earthquake;
                    and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Even if
                        parties had reached any form of agreement, such contract was void by reason
                        of common mistake between the parties as to the subject matter of the
                        contract at the time of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Newport also contended
                    that as the 1% deposit was paid on the basis that a contract would be executed
                    between the parties, the absence of any completed contract should result in the
                    refund of the deposit by Norwest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Therefore, the dispute between Norwest and
                    Newport boiled down to the following issues:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether there was a binding contract between
                            Norwest and Newport;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The characterisation of the subject-matter of the
                            contract between Norwest and Newport (<em>ie</em>,
                            whether the subject matter was the Shares or the Chinese Business);
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the 1% deposit should be refunded to
                            Newport.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">After hearing the parties’ submissions, we decided issue
                    (a) in the negative for the reasons given below, at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>. Consequently, it was unnecessary for us to make a decision
                    on issue (b), and issue (c) was answered in the affirmative. Since
                    there was no binding contract between Norwest and Newport, the 1% deposit ought
                    to be refunded because there has been a total failure of
                consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The “subject to contract” issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Newport’s first response to
                    Norwest’s claim for damages was that there was no concluded contract
                    between the two parties owing to the insertion of a “subject to
                    contract” clause by Newport in both the First and Second Firm Letters of
                    Offer. Newport contended that after the Second Firm Letter of Offer, it still
                    needed to negotiate with the Liquidator several conditions precedent, including
                    one stipulating that the Chinese Business should remain in the same operating
                    state as observed by Newport during the due diligence stage, before it could
                    enter into a binding agreement with Norwest. Newport’s position was that
                    under these circumstances, owing to the absence of a concluded Sale and Purchase
                    Agreement, the <em>prima facie</em> meaning of a
                    “subject to contract” clause should be applied, <em>ie</em>, there was no binding and enforceable contract between
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Norwest took the position that all the
                    essential terms of the contract had been agreed upon and nothing remained to be
                    negotiated between the parties. In particular, since it was a liquidation sale,
                    the Liquidator was not in a position to give any representations or warranties.
                    Norwest also submitted that the “subject to contract” clause
                    should not be given its <em>prima facie</em> meaning
                    because of the “very strong and exceptional context” which gave
                    rise to the inference that parties had intended to be bound upon acceptance of
                    the Second Firm Letter of Offer. These circumstances included:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Newport’s procuring of third party funding,
                            under which its own obligations were triggered upon Norwest’s
                            acceptance of its Second Firm Letter of Offer;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Newport’s decision to call a trading halt

                        and</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     According to <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    30th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Chitty</em>”) at
                    para 2-118, agreements for the sale of land are usually made
                    “subject to contract” and such agreements are normally regarded as
                    incomplete until the terms of a formal contract have been settled and approved
                    by the parties. While such “subject to contract” clauses are
                    well-known in conveyancing transactions, they are not peculiar to that area and
                    are often used in commercial transactions (see M P Furmston and
                    G J Tolhurst, <em>Contract Formation: Law and
                        Practice</em> (Oxford University Press, 2010) (“Furmston and
                    Tolhurst”) at para 9.15).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the local context, it was held in the
                    Singapore High Court decision of <em>Ground &amp; Sharp Precision
                        Engineering Pte Ltd v Midview Realty Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 160 that
                    (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The meaning of “subject to contract” is clear. This
                        expression simply means that “unless and until a formal written
                        contract has been executed and exchanged by the parties there is no binding
                        and enforceable contract between them. That is so even if the parties are in
                        agreement as to all the terms.” (<em>Thomson Plaza

<p class="Judg-1">In the Singapore High Court decision of <em>United

                    (where this particular point was not in issue)), it was similarly held (at [57])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well settled that the phrase “subject to contract”
                        makes it clear that the intention of the parties is that neither of them is
                        to be contractually bound until a contract is signed. The negotiations
                        remain subject to and dependent upon the preparation of a formal contract.
                        Either party may withdraw from the negotiations before a final agreement has
                        been concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While the holding in <em>United
                        Artists</em> quoted above seems to suggest that the phrase
                    “subject to contract” is <em>conclusive</em>
                    of the intention of the parties, in our judgment, the better view is that the
                    question whether there is a binding contract between the parties should be
                    determined by considering all the circumstances, not just the inclusion of the
                    stock phrase “subject to contract” (on the basis that the
                        <em>substance</em> of the situation must always
                    prevail). These would include what was communicated between the parties by words
                    or conduct. In this regard, we are in agreement with the recent decision of the
                    UK Supreme Court in <em>RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v Molkerei Alois
                        Müller GmbH &amp; Co KG (UK Production)</em> [2010]
                    1 WLR 753 in which it was held that (at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether in such a case [<em>ie</em>, concerning an
                        agreement that is “subject to contract”] the parties agreed to
                        enter into a binding contract, waiving reliance on the “subject to
                        [written] contract” term or understanding will again <em>depend upon all the circumstances of the case</em>,
                        although the cases show that the court <em>will not lightly
                            so hold</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The documentary evidence of the communication
                    between the parties pertaining to the transaction contained several indications
                    to an objective observer that they had not intended to be contractually bound
                    until a formal Sale and Purchase Agreement was negotiated and executed. Right at
                    the outset, the Information Memorandum stated expressly at para 3.0 that
                    the intention of the Liquidator was to sell Norwest together with Norwest China
                        “<em>subject to a Sale and Purchase
                        Agreement</em>” [emphasis added]. In the “Events and
                    Timeline” outlined at para 3.1 of the Information Memorandum, the
                    Liquidator’s acceptance was expressly “<em>subject
                        to agreement on terms and conditions</em>” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Apart from the Information Memorandum, the
                    letters that Newport sent to the Liquidator contained several variations of
                    “subject to contract” clauses. The Expression of Interest
                    (following the template in Appendix A to the Information Memorandum) that
                    Taylor Collison sent to the Liquidator expressly stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event we should decide to make a firm offer for [Norwest Chemicals]
                        and this offer is in turn accepted by you, we agree to pay the balance of
                        the purchase price (less this deposit) <em>in accordance to
                            [sic] the terms and conditions set out in the Sale and Purchase
                            Agreement</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Second Firm Letter of Offer provided that Newport’s offer
                    price of S$10.25m was “<em>subject to the terms and
                        conditions in the Sale and Purchase Agreement to be
                    negotiated</em>” [emphasis added]. In that same letter, Newport
                    reiterated that in the event that its offer was accepted, it would pay the
                    balance of the purchase price less the deposit of S$55,000 that had been
                    submitted to Norwest, “in accordance with the terms and conditions set
                    out in the Sale and Purchase Agreement <em>to be
                        negotiated</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the Acceptance Letter, the Liquidator
                    stated that “[a] formal Sale and Purchase Agreement is to be <em>negotiated and executed</em> between [Newport] and
                    [Norwest]” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Given the various references in the
                    communications between the parties to the negotiation of a Sale and Purchase
                    Agreement after acceptance, Norwest’s argument that there was <em>nothing</em> left to be negotiated seemed somewhat
                    disingenuous. Any objective reading of the documents would lead to the inference
                    that the parties had intended to negotiate the terms and conditions of a Sale
                    and Purchase Agreement under which Newport’s obligation to pay the
                    purchase price would be fulfilled. The force of that argument was diminished
                    further when we considered that the internal email correspondence between the
                    Liquidator and Hwa Hong evinced Norwest’s contemplation that the terms and
                    conditions of the Sale and Purchase Agreement still needed to be negotiated
                    before the agreement could be executed. In an email from Simon Ong, chief
                    financial officer of Hwa Hong, to the Liquidator dated 8 May 2008, at
                    3.43pm, he expressed his concern that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the deal cannot be counted as completed until we receive the money.
                        That means that <em>they [ie, Newport] may still walk away
                            from the deal if certain conditions precedent (if any are to be
                            introduced) are not met or waived</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this connection, as a first step, can you share with us your proposed
                        draft sales [<em>sic</em>] and purchase agreement? We
                        will get our lawyers to help and suggest amendments to tighten the agreement
                        to improve our chances of obtaining a successful completion of the
                        transaction. <em>We must not allow too many condition
                            precedents [sic] to be introduced into the sales [sic] and purchase

                        the transaction as stipulated in the timetable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response, the Liquidator replied in an email dated 8 May 2008
                    at 4.12pm, saying that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in any deal of this nature and size, and as you have correctly pointed
                        out, there is always the possibility that things may fall apart and yes,
                        until the money is in the bank, there is no certainty that this is
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Given that the sale is on a “as is, where is” basis,
                            <em>I think there shouldn’t be too many conditions
                            precedents</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>to go through</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If there was indeed nothing left to be negotiated, neither the
                    Liquidator nor Simon Ong needed to have worried about the conditions precedent
                    that Newport might have sought to include in the eventual Sale and Purchase
                    Agreement to be executed between the parties. After receiving the First Firm
                    Letter of Offer on 2 May 2008 and prior to the occurrence of the Sichuan
                    Earthquake and sending their Acceptance Letter on 12 May 2008,
                    Norwest’s view—while not conclusive, but by no means
                    irrelevant—appeared to be that there were terms to be negotiated before
                    the Sale and Purchase Agreement could be executed between the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Even if the essential terms of a contract have
                    been agreed upon, and thus needed no further negotiation regarding those terms,
                    parties who enter into an agreement which is expressly “subject to
                    contract” may be taken to have intended for legal relations to be
                    deferred until the execution of a formal contract, unless there is strong and
                    exceptional evidence to the contrary. In the Malaysian High Court decision of
                        <em>Low Kar Yit &amp; Ors v Mohamed Isa &amp; Anor</em>
                    [1963] MLJ 165 (“<em>Low Kar
                    Yit</em>”), the defendants granted an option to the plaintiffs to
                    purchase a piece of land, providing in the option that if it was exercised, it
                    would be subject to both a formal contract agreed upon by both parties, and the
                    approval of the sale and contract by the High Court at Kuala Lumpur. After the
                    plaintiffs exercised the option, a contract reflecting the terms agreed between
                    the parties was prepared by the defendants’ solicitors and sent to the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors, but one of the defendants subsequently refused to
                    execute the contract. In an action for specific performance or alternatively
                    damages for breach of contract, the High Court of Kuala Lumpur held that the
                    stipulation that the option was to be subject to a formal contract to be agreed
                    upon meant that there was no binding contract between the parties until such a
                    formal contract was entered into. At 173, Gill J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[E]ven where there is nothing in the agreement to suggest that the parties
                        contemplate that the subsequent contract shall contain any new or different
                        terms, nevertheless if it appears that the parties do not intend to bind
                        themselves contractually by the agreement but only by the subsequent conduct
                        is in words which according to their natural construction import a
                        condition, this will almost invariably be conclusive that the agreement
                        itself was not intended to be a contract. To my mind this was true of this
                        case. <em>It will bear repetition if I say that when the
                            actual phrase “subject to contract” is used, the courts
                            tend to give effect to those words unless there is strong evidence to
                            the contrary. The result is that the agreement which is made
                            “subject to contract” is of no legal effect</em>.
                        Perhaps I should add that the plaintiffs in this case are asking the court
                        to order the defendants to execute the draft agreement agreed upon, which
                        amounts in effect to asking the court to enforce an agreement to enter into
                        an agreement. That is an order which the court clearly has no power to make
                        in the circumstances of the case. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Singapore High Court decision of <em>Thomson Plaza (Pte) Ltd v Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store
                        Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 483
                    concerned the grant of a new tenancy by the applicant Thomson Plaza to Yaohan
                    Department Store, “subject to all the terms and conditions as contained
                    in the specimen Lease Agreement”, which was not executed.
                    G P Selvam J held (at [29]) that there was no tenancy, following Gill J’s
                    reasoning in <em>Low Kar Yit</em>, as the “subject
                    to contract” provision made it clear that the execution of a lease
                    agreement was a condition precedent to the tenancy coming into being.
                    Selvam J further explained (at [28]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parties who contract on the basis of “subject to contract”
                        do so because they want an escape route in case they wish to call the
                        transaction off. They do not consider it a wrong way of business. It is a
                        last-chance escape route in case they find it impossible or undesirable to
                        fulfil the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We turn next to the question whether there was
                    a “very strong and exceptional context” which would override the
                        <em>prima facie</em> meaning of the various
                    “subject to contract” provisions contained in the correspondence
                    between the parties. Looking at all the circumstances in their proper context,
                    we were of the view that they did not constitute a strong and exceptional
                    context sufficient to override the plain meaning of the “subject to
                    contract” provisions for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     First, third party funding was the
                    subject-matter of agreements between Newport and Newport’s funding
                    partners such as Lawrence Asset Management Inc (“the funding
                    letters”), which agreements Norwest was not privy to. The funding
                    letters, dated 8 May 2008, must be read in the context of Newport’s
                    confirmation in the cover letters accompanying the First Firm Letter of Offer
                    and the Second Firm Letter of Offer that Newport had “sufficient funding
                    to complete the/this transaction”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The confirmation of sufficient funding was
                    certainly an attempt to bolster Newport’s chances of eliciting
                    Norwest’s acceptance of its offer. The fact that, pursuant to the terms of
                    the funding letters, Newport’s obligations to the third party funding
                    partners under the funding letters would be triggered by Norwest’s
                    acceptance did not imply that Newport had similarly intended to be bound to
                    fulfil the separate and distinct contract with Norwest upon Norwest’s
                    acceptance of Newport’s offer. We accepted Newport’s explanation
                    that it had needed the funds to be in so that it could be in a position to
                    complete the transaction with Norwest once the negotiations on the terms and
                    conditions of the Sale and Purchase Agreement were completed. Indeed, by their
                    very terms the funding letters had provided for an exit procedure should the
                    transaction with Norwest not go through, in spite of Norwest’s acceptance.
                    Clause 8 of the funding letters made it clear that if “for any
                    reason” the Shares are not acquired by Newport, the parties to the
                    funding letters could recover their full contribution with no drawdown on the
                    amount previously committed. In any case, there was no drawdown on any funding
                    partner’s contribution since Newport had not completed the transaction to
                    acquire the Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Second, Newport’s announcement of a
                    trading halt of its shares simply stated that “[Newport] intends to make
                    an announcement regarding the acquisition of an asset in China”. On its
                    face, the announcement did not suggest that there was already a concluded
                    contract with Norwest. Indeed, in a subsequent announcement on 21 May 2008,
                    Newport explained that after the media reports regarding the Sichuan Earthquake
                    on 12 May 2008, subsequent news of the damage and casualties of the Sichuan
                    Earthquake was far worse than earlier reported, and Newport had
                    “requested the ASX [<em>ie</em>, the Australian
                    Securities Exchange] to suspend securities of [Newport] to enable it to be
                    better informed of the situation in China with respect to the
                        asset”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Third, Newport’s payment of the
                    remaining sum of S$47,500 of its deposit to Norwest on 14 May 2008 was at
                    the Liquidator’s request, in order to comply with the terms in the
                    Information Memorandum that were reiterated in the Acceptance Letter, <em>viz</em>, that all offers should be accompanied by a deposit
                    of 1% of the offer price. At the time the sum of S$47,500 was paid, <em>ie</em>, 14 May 2008, Newport had not received definite
                    confirmation from the Liquidator or other executives in Norwest as to the extent
                    of the damage to the Chinese Business caused by the Sichuan Earthquake. In order
                    that its offer would not be rejected in the event that the Mines and the
                    Production Facilities turned out to have emerged unscathed by the Sichuan
                    Earthquake, Newport decided to pay the balance of its 1% deposit so as to comply
                    with the express terms of the Information Memorandum. This was on the
                    understanding that the 1% deposit was refundable if the negotiations did not
                    result in the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Thus, the payment of
                    the 1% deposit indicated Newport’s willingness to negotiate the terms and
                    conditions of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. It did not indicate
                    Newport’s intention to create legal relations upon Norwest’s
                    acceptance of its Second Firm Letter of Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For all these reasons, we were of the view
                    that the plain meaning of the “subject to contract” provisions in
                    the Information Memorandum, the First Firm Letter of Offer, the Second Firm
                    Letter of Offer and the Acceptance Letter should be applied in this case. The
                    facts that Norwest relied on for its claim that the plain meaning should be
                    displaced did not constitute a very strong and exceptional context in which to
                    do so. In the circumstances, therefore, there was no binding contract entered
                    into between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     However, we noted that the Judge considered
                    and rejected the implied term approach adopted by the English Court of Appeal of
                        <em>Financings Ltd v Stimson</em> [1962]
                    1 WLR 1184 (“<em>Financings</em>”)
                    and by the New Zealand Supreme Court decision of <em>Dysart
                        Timbers Limited v Roderick William Nielsen</em> [2009]
                    3 NZLR 160 (“<em>Dysart
                    Timbers</em>”). According to the Judge (at [63]), “<em>Financings</em> was based on the implication of a condition
                    into the offer that the subject matter of the offer must remain in substantially
                    the same condition it was in at the time of the offer, failing which the offer
                    lapses”. <em>Dysart Timbers</em> appeared to qualify
                    the approach in <em>Financings</em> by requiring that the
                    change in circumstances must be fundamental in order to justify the court
                    holding that an offer had lapsed where a change of circumstances had arisen
                    between the time an offer was made and the time it was purportedly accepted.
                    However, differing views were expressed as to the precise juridical basis that
                    ought to be adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge was doubtful that the implied term
                    approach in <em>Financings</em> provides a satisfactory
                    juristic basis on which to approach the formation problems. Basically, she was
                    of the view (having regard, presumably, to the facts of the present appeal) that
                    an implied term is an artificial solution to unanticipated changes of
                    circumstances, and the formulation of the precise term to be implied is also
                    likely to be fraught with artificiality and indeed arbitrariness, and therefore
                    the usual objective approach to offer and acceptance, or the doctrine of common
                    mistake, is more than adequate to provide a principled approach to changes in
                    circumstances occurring after an offer was made and before the offer is
                    purported to be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     These conceptual problems may well be
                    pertinent in considering whether the court should apply the <em>Financings</em> approach to the facts of a particular case. But it is
                    not necessary to express our views on this matter as we have found that there
                    was no binding contract between the parties on the ground that the offer was
                    subject to contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the reasons set out above, we dismissed
                    Norwest’s appeal in CA 151/2009 and allowed Newport’s appeal in
                    CA 153/2009, and awarded costs for both appeals to Newport. The usual
                    consequential orders will apply.</p>
