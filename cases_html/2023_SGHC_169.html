These involved five counts of abetment by conspiracy to commit rape under s 375(1)(a) punishable under s 375(2) read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and one count of sexual assault by digital-vaginal penetration under s 376(2)(a) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 A further 11 related charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”) with the accused’s consent for the purpose of sentencing. Five of the TIC charges were also for abetment by conspiracy to commit rape. Another three counts were for sexual assault by penetration (two for penile-oral penetration and one for digital-vaginal penetration). Two counts involved voluntarily causing hurt by administering a poison under s 328 of the Penal Code and one final count was for outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I sentenced the accused to an aggregate imprisonment term of 29 years and to caning subject to the maximum of 24 strokes permitted by law. As the accused has appealed against his sentence, the full reasons for my decision incorporating my oral sentencing remarks are set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The accused admitted the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I do not propose to recite the SOF in detail for present purposes. I shall only set out a brief summary of the salient aspects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Through the “SammyBoy” online forum and messaging platforms such as “Skype” messenger, the accused was in contact with his five co-accused (B2 – “CEK”: B3 – “CEL”; B4 – “CEM”; B5 – “CEN” and B6 – “CEO”) to discuss their wife-sharing fantasies where they (as husbands) would watch another man (the accused or one of the co-accused) having sex with their wives. They then proceeded with their plans to realise their fantasies, and this took place from as early as 2010 until 9 August 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Of the six proceeded charges, the five proceeded charges of abetment by conspiracy to commit rape involved the accused and his co-accused arranging to sedate their wives or ex-wife through spiking their drinks or on the pretext of feeding them medication. While their victims were unconscious, the accused or his co-accused would have sexual intercourse with the other man’s wife (or ex-wife). In the remaining charge of the six proceeded charges, the accused digitally penetrated the co-accused’s wife. In various instances, they did not use condoms. As these acts occurred, the husbands (or ex-husband) stood by watching their wives (or ex-wife) being raped or sexually assaulted. At times, they would also video-record or photograph the sexual acts taking place. The accused and his co-accused shared these photographs or video footages with each other. From Skype chats between the accused and CEK, it would appear that some of these photographs or videos were also uploaded onto the Internet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In respect of the five proceeded counts involving abetment by conspiracy to commit rape, the accused had arranged in three instances for his wife (“A1”) to be raped by his co-accused. In respect of the other two proceeded counts, the accused himself had raped two other victims who were the wife (“A2”) and ex-wife (“A4”) respectively of two of his co-accused, CEK and CEM. For the remaining count proceeded with, the accused had digitally penetrated A2. The victims were sedated in all the instances by the accused or the co-accused and were not in any state to consent to any of the acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The offences only came to light in the early hours of 1 January 2020. While the accused was sleeping, A1 was turning off a video which she saw playing on the accused’s handphone when she chanced upon a “Skype” chat between the accused and CEK. The chat contained explicit images of her including one of her naked with a blindfold, and another of her unconscious with two penises over her face. As she scrolled down the chat messages, she discovered that the accused and CEK had been “exchanging wives” and had done this by using “drugs, charms and stimulants”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Shocked, A1 slapped the accused awake, who confessed to her that the two penises in the image were his and CEK’s. After A1’s discovery, the accused deleted the incriminating chats from his handphone. Later that day, the accused brought A1 to CEK’s residence, at her request. When confronted by A1, CEK admitted that he had sex with her while she was unconscious, and that he had also made his own wife (A2) unconscious for the accused to have sex with her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 2 January 2020, A1 lodged a police report. On 3 January 2020, the police arrested the accused and CEK, and seized from the accused items including a blindfold used by him on A1 in the commission of the offences. The police subsequently also seized digital storage media from the accused, CEK, CEM and CEN, containing photographs and videos of themselves and the other men performing various sexual acts on the victims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The SOF also contained other relevant background information pertaining to the 11 TIC charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ sentencing submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Prosecution submitted that there were serious offence and offender-specific aggravating factors as outlined in the Prosecution’s Address on Sentence (“PAS”) and its oral sentencing submissions. Retribution and deterrence were the dominant sentencing considerations.

</div> Two main factors were highlighted in the Prosecution’s oral submissions, namely the clear premeditation and planning involved in all the charges, and the gross betrayal and abuse of trust against the accused’s own wife. The only mitigating factor was the accused’s plea of guilt, which showed some remorse on his part by sparing the victims from having to testify at trial.

</div> Substantially similar objections had been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings. I should clarify that the draft SOF had since been amended. A revised SOF which took into account his previous objections was before me on the date when he was scheduled to plead guilty (4 May 2023). In addition, as reflected in the transcripts of the hearing on 4 May 2023, prior to his plea being taken, I had ascertained from the accused whether he continued to have concerns about any portion of the revised SOF. While he confirmed that some concerns did remain, I did not see how any of these concerns would amount to a qualification of his plea. In the event, his plea of guilt was eventually recorded uneventfully and he did not raise any further objections to the SOF. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In mitigation, and with reference in particular to WMP2, the accused expressed his regret and remorse over the offences. He stated that he was “sincerely regretful” of his wrongdoings and remorsefully wished to submit himself to punishment as soon as possible. He stated that A1 had forgiven him, and his mother and daughters wanted him to return home.

Dr Tan diagnosed the accused as having compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (“CSBD”) or sex addiction in layman’s terms. The accused sought to rely on this diagnosis in support of his mitigation plea. I shall briefly address the reliability and relevance of Dr Tan’s report as a preliminary point. That being said, I was also fully conscious that the accused had gone on in WMP2 to label Dr Tan’s diagnosis as “superficial”

</div> and also seemed to be somewhat critical of Dr Tan in his oral submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Dr Tan opined in his report that the accused’s condition of CSBD together with his low self-esteem and self-doubt about his masculinity, were “significant contributory factors” in his commission of the alleged offences. Dr Tan did not however suggest that his disorder had impaired his judgment and decision-making capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In response to WMP1, the Prosecution tendered Dr Jerome Goh’s Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) reports dated 6 February 2020 and 3 October 2022, indicating that the accused did not have CSBD or any other mental disorder at the time of the alleged offences. Dr Goh’s opinion was that a high sex drive did not necessarily equate to CSBD or sex addiction and the accused’s sexual impulses or urges were not irresistible or uncontrollable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I found that a “Newton” hearing was unnecessary as the doctors’ respective reports and conclusions could be evaluated by the court on the basis of the analysis and reasoning found in their reports. Dr Tan’s report was of questionable assistance since it was premised largely on the accused’s self-reported account, with no real attempt to verify his assertions against other available material such as the draft charges or statement of facts. More importantly, Dr Tan had not adequately explained how he had formed his views about the accused having suffered from a mental condition since over 10 years ago based solely on his fairly recent consultations in March 2022. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the Prosecution pointedly noted in its Reply to the Plea in Mitigation (“Reply to WMP1”), the “fatal flaw” in Dr Tan’s report was that there was no reference at all to the accused’s account of the alleged offences. As such, Dr Tan did not provide any explanation or reasoning as to the effect of the accused’s purported mental condition on his offending.

</div> In fact, Dr Tan’s report contained no mention whatsoever of the numerous rape or digital-vaginal/penile-oral penetration offences which were perpetrated over the course of eight years while the victims were drugged and unconscious. It would appear that Dr Tan’s conclusions were based on a completely different and palpably mistaken understanding of the actual factual context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I did not accept that Dr Tan’s report was reliable and relevant. Much like the psychiatric report that was relied upon by the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 4 SLR 805, Dr Tan’s report was of little or no assistance to the accused in mitigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Ultimately, the accused was clearly able to understand the nature and consequences of his conduct. His condition, even if properly diagnosed, had in any event not impaired his ability to perform his work, or to judge, plan and make decisions. I did not accept that his conduct was somehow mitigated by a claimed addiction to sex. The point was put across well at para 17 of the Prosecution’s Reply to WMP1: “no mitigating weight can or should be given to a rapist who claims he is addicted to sex”.

</div> These claims rang hollow. The sordid facts of this case spoke for themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I found no discernible indication of genuine remorse. In support of his mitigation plea, the accused further adduced letters pleading for leniency from A1, his mother and three of his young daughters. He maintained that these letters were given by them voluntarily and he had their consent to tender them to the court. What he did not clarify (and possibly was not able to confirm) was whether the writers continued to stand by their expressed sentiments. In response, the Prosecution pointed out that these letters were all written quite some time back in March 2020, not long after the accused was arrested and remanded. The writers were obviously unaware then that he would be charged with as many as 17 offences. This was a significant point. The Prosecution clarified that A1 had not realised the full extent of the accused’s misdeeds until much later. This was reflected in her Victim Impact Statement recorded on 25 January 2022, annexed as Annex A to the PAS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Prosecution highlighted that A1 had stated at paras 7 and 8 of her Victim Impact Statement that she had thought there was only one co-accused at the start. I reproduce these paras below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7  At the start, I only thought that there was only one co-accused. Subsequently, when there were more and more accused being charged in court, only did I realise how bad this case was. I kept thinking about how cruel he was to do this to me.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8 As time went by, I began to feel numbed about the whole case and I chose not to feel anything about it. I wanted to focus my energy to take care of my children and the family.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Having regard to A1’s sentiments as set out above, it would appear that the accused’s suggestion that A1 had unconditionally forgiven him and would support his plea for leniency was misleading, or inaccurate at the very least.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Calibration of the sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Prosecution fairly conceded that the accused should still be given some credit for his plea of guilt which would at least spare the victims from having to recount their ordeal at his trial. I agreed that this was fair and appropriate on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Apart from the accused’s (late) plea of guilt, there were no other mitigating factors. There was a compelling need for a deterrent sentence and also for the sentence to adequately reflect retributive principles. To aggravate matters, there was persistence in his offending conduct spanning a considerable number of years from 2010 to 2018, which would warrant a measure of specific deterrence. Given his repeated offending over these years, he could not be treated purely as a first offender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On account of the accumulated offence-specific aggravating factors, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission as to the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> frameworks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> framework specifies that for rape cases which contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors, the sentencing range from which an indicative starting point can be derived ought to fall between 13 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework specifies that for digital penetration cases which contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors, the sentencing range from which an indicative starting point can be derived ought to fall between 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, the Prosecution justifiably identified the appropriate indicative starting point sentences as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">a. between 13 to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in respect of the rape charges involving A1, A2 and A4; and</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">b. between 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane in respect of the digital penetration charge involving A2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In respect of the rape offences, given that the accused had pleaded guilty, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point sentence of up to 17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane should be adjusted downwards to between nine to 11 years’ imprisonment and 10 to 12 strokes of the cane for the 2nd and 7th charges which involved A2 and A4.

The Prosecution’s proposed sentences were also consistent with the sentencing precedents cited.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the reasons set out above, having taken into account all the relevant sentencing considerations, I sentenced the accused as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">a. 2nd charge – 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">b. 3rd charge – eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">c. 7th charge – 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">d. 11th charge – 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">e. 14th charge – 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">f. 16th charge - 11 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), I ordered the sentences for the 3rd, 7th and 11th charges to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate imprisonment sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment. The punishment of caning totalled 66 strokes but this was limited to the maximum statutory permissible limit of 24 strokes as set out in s 328(6) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the total sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was not crushing or disproportionate to the gravity of the offences. It was in line with considerations of sentencing parity when compared against the sentences of his co-accused, all of whom faced far fewer charges. Specifically, none of the four co-accused who had been sentenced thus far was involved in more than five offences. The accused was involved in 17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The sentence was backdated to the date of his arrest on 3 January 2020.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As a postscript, I note that the accused has raised only two grounds for appealing in his notice of appeal:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.  My spouse wish that I am able to seek the honourable courts’ leniency for a lighter sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. I was not able to be represented by a defense counsel at the point of pleading guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I shall address these grounds briefly. In respect of the first ground, even granting the accused the benefit of doubt that A1 had in fact expressed such a wish (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>. for him to have a lighter sentence), no contemporaneous written mitigation plea from A1 was put forth on his behalf when he pleaded guilty before me. I noted that none of his family members appeared to be present in the courtroom as well. All the accused had to show for as a demonstration of A1’s purported continuing support for him was her letter dating from 25 March 2020. This letter had evidently been superseded by events, as A1’s subsequent Victim Impact Statement of 25 January 2022 revealed. Apart from the accused’s own say-so, there was nothing else to indicate that A1 had since experienced a change of heart.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As for the second ground, it is pertinent to note from the case record that the accused had previously been represented by two different counsel. His first counsel had acted for him since 2020 and was discharged on 13 May 2022, apparently because the accused disagreed with counsel’s advice. His second counsel was discharged on 28 October 2022 when he was originally scheduled to plead guilty along with a few of his co-accused. He apparently changed his mind and counsel obtained a discharge owing to his inconsistent instructions. In short, the accused already had the benefit of legal advice for well over two years from two different counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The fact that the accused was unrepresented when he pleaded guilty on 4 May 2023 is not relevant to whether his sentence was manifestly excessive. He was afforded every opportunity to mitigate. He was given more than sufficient notice and ample time to prepare for his mitigation. The record would also show that I had endeavoured to guide him as much as I could through the course of the proceedings. I do not think that he was prejudiced or impeded in any way on account of being unrepresented.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gail Wong, Ang Siok Chen and Lim Ying Min</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Accused in person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
