The applicable test to determine whether to set aside a default judgment hinged on the preliminary consideration of whether the judgment was a regular or irregular default judgment. The AR found that the Default Judgment was a regular default judgment, notwithstanding a minor clerical error in the memorandum of service whereby it was indicated that the originating claim was served on the “Claimant” by the “Defendant”. This was a minor issue which did not prejudice the respondent.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Accordingly, on the basis that the default judgment sought to be set aside was a regular default judgment, the core issue was whether the respondent could establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> defence in the sense of showing that there were triable or arguable issues (<span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span> at [60]). The burden was on the respondent to establish the merits of its defence.

</div> Alternatively, and at the very latest, an agreement would have been formed by 30 May 2022 when the respondent wrote back to the appellant, acknowledging the respondent’s obligation to pay the sum under the Settlement Agreement. This was evident when he stated that “[t]he intention and commitment of the parties to ending this matter is unequivocal ... Funds are likely to be sent by the end of this week or early next week.”

In any event, the respondent could not reasonably explain its delay since Mr Goel had been alerted of the imminent suit in OC 139 in an email from the appellant’s solicitors sometime on 15 July 2022 just before the commencement of OC 139. This email contained a letter of demand and an offer to settle in accordance with the Rules of Court 2021, as well as a statutory demand which should have alerted him to the fact that a lawsuit was imminent.

In this appeal, the respondent did not dispute the AR’s finding that the Default Judgment had been regularly obtained.

First, a review of the correspondence showed that a binding contract had been formed between the parties, notwithstanding that the Settlement Agreement had not been executed by the respondent. Earlier at a hearing on 5 June 2023, I had directed the appellant to show that the acceleration clause was agreed to by the respondent’s representative, Mr Goel, and that this acceleration clause had been contained in earlier versions of the Settlement Agreement exchanged between the parties. Pursuant to this direction, the appellant’s representative filed an affidavit setting out the relevant correspondence and explaining that this was indeed the case.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> constituted an acceptance by the respondent of the Settlement Agreement. Having agreed to the “<span class="font-italic">only</span> two changes” in the draft settlement agreement, it necessarily meant that the respondent had also implicitly accepted the other terms within the Settlement Agreement. In other words, the respondent had clearly and unequivocally agreed to <span class="font-italic">all</span> the terms of the Settlement Agreement. An agreement was accordingly formed as of 13 May 2022 at 11.54am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 While I was alive to the force of the respondent’s argument that the Settlement Agreement had yet to be signed, this did not preclude the formation of a binding contract between the parties. It was not invariably the case that a binding contract could only arise upon the signing of a written agreement by all parties. Unsigned agreements could be found to be binding notwithstanding that the written offer expressly provided that it was not binding until signed and that one party had yet to sign the agreement: <span class="font-italic">CUG v CUH</span> [2022] 5 SLR 55 at [87], citing <span class="font-italic">Reveille Independent LLC v </span><span class="font-italic">Anotech International (UK) Ltd</span> [2016] EWCA Civ 443 (“<span class="font-italic">Reveille</span>”) at [41]. This necessarily followed from the elementary principle of contract law that a contract would arise where the necessary ingredients for the formation of contact were present. In any case, I was not persuaded that anything in the correspondence or draft agreements precluded the conclusion of a binding agreement in the absence of a signature by both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 With my finding that there was a concluded Settlement Agreement, I turn now to examine its terms. Clause 1.1 of the agreement as amended had expressly provided that the “[Reputation Administration Service Pte Ltd] shall pay forthwith to [Spamhaus Technology Ltd] the amount US$75,000.00 within [14] days of receipt of a duly executed agreement from [Spamhaus Technology Ltd]”. This clause apparently contemplated the respondent being bound by the aforementioned payment obligation notwithstanding that the Settlement Agreement had not been signed or executed by the respondent. The respondent was obliged to make payment of US$75,000 within 14 days from the time of receipt of the duly executed agreement from the appellant. I would emphasise that this clause with a payment time frame of 21 days was added by the respondent itself, but it was subsequently amended by the appellant to a payment time frame of 14 days, and respondent later agreed to this amendment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 If the US$75,000 was not paid within the stipulated 14 days, the acceleration clause found within clause 1 would be immediately triggered. This acceleration clause, which formed the core of the appellant’s claim in OC 139 was specifically agreed to by the respondent. Any argument by the respondent that the acceleration clause had only been sprung on the respondent at a late stage such that the respondent could not have or did not agree to the acceleration clause would have failed. I was satisfied that the clause had always been included in the drafts from the very beginning; it had not been added at a late stage. The changes made by the respondent to the draft clauses showed that the acceleration clause was expressly affirmed by the respondent. In fact, it was the respondent itself which first proposed the addition of clause 1.4 in the draft dated 27 April 2022 that it would consent to judgment being entered against it for the amount of US$251,359.75 if it failed to make payment pursuant to clause 1.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 My view that an agreement had been formed on 13 May 2022 by the unequivocal acceptance of the respondent was <span class="font-italic">reinforced </span>by its subsequent conduct. In this regard, I was cognisant that the issue of whether subsequent conduct was admissible in determining the formation of a contract remained unsettled in our courts. According to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Jiacipto Jiaravanon</span> [2019] 1 SLR 696 (“<span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine</span>”) at [78]–[79], the court observed that while “[t]he admissibility and relevance of subsequent conduct in the formation and interpretation of contracts has yet to receive detailed scrutiny this court” and the court had declined  to express any firm views on this issue, it stated that “evidence of subsequent conduct has traditionally been regarded as admissible and relevant.”: see also <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2019) at paras 13-136. However, in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Luna”</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1054 (“<span class="font-italic">Luna</span>”) at [34], the court appeared to have aligned itself in favour of the admissibility of subsequent conduct. The court observed in <span class="font-italic">Luna</span> at [34] that the distinction in approach to the consideration of subsequent conduct between cases involving the interpretation of contracts and cases involving the formation of contracts was “justified on the basis of principle and authority”. In making this observation, it specifically cited its earlier observations in <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine</span> at [78] that evidence of subsequent conduct had traditionally been regarded as admissible and relevant where the court was ascertaining whether a contract had been formed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Assuming then that subsequent conduct would be admissible to assess the formation of a contract, I was satisfied that my conclusion that an agreement had been formed on 13 May 2022 by the acceptance of the respondent was <span class="font-italic">reinforced </span>by its subsequent conduct. Subsequent emails from Mr Goel dated 23 May 2022 and 30 May 2022 expressly acknowledged the respondent’s obligation to pay the sums due under the Settlement Agreement. In the email dated 23 May 2022 at 9.59pm, Mr Goel acknowledged that “the return of the [executed document] will not impact my sending the settlement funds agreed to your client – likely before the end of May”. Later, on 30 May 2022 at 4.39pm, Mr Goel once again confirmed that “the intention and commitment of the parties to ending this matter is unequivocal” and that the appellant “will be receiving the funds shortly”. Mr Goel added that the appellant “need to be patient for this short delay from what was expected on both side when we agreed [sic] the settlement terms”. From these emails, the respondent had operated on the basis that there was already a binding Settlement Agreement. Specifically, Mr Goel had expressly confirmed that funds would likely reach the appellant “before the end of May”. This would have been premised on the recognition on Mr Goel’s part that clause 1.1 required payment to be made within 14 days of receipt of the executed copy of the Settlement Agreement from the appellant, a copy of which was in fact received by the respondent on 17 May 2022 at 11.19am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 A draft agreement could have contractual force if essentially all the terms had been agreed and their subsequent conduct indicated this. This was so even if the parties did not comply with a requirement that to be binding the agreement would have to be signed: <span class="font-italic">Reveille</span> at [41], citing the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">RTS Flexible Systems Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Molkerei Alois M</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">ü</span><span class="font-italic">ller</span><span class="font-italic"> GmbH &amp; Co KG (UK Production)</span> [2010] 1 WLR 753 at [54]–[56]. As I observed above at [33], neither the draft Settlement Agreement nor the parties’ correspondence disclosed that parties stipulated that a binding agreement could only arise upon the signature of both parties. Even if there had been such a stipulation, I was nonetheless satisfied that parties had reached an agreement on the terms set out in the Settlement Agreement <span class="font-italic">before</span> 23 May 2022, with the precise date being 13 May 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The respondent relied further on a subsequent email it had sent to the appellant on 29 June 2022 at 10.24am which suggested that the settlement reached was merely a “proposed settlement” to which the appellant was still, at that point, entitled to reject. I was unable to accept that this unilateral reference to the tentative nature of the settlement could negative the Settlement Agreement already concluded on 13 May 2022. If anything, it could even amount to a repudiatory breach by the respondent that it would not comply with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. However, as the appellant did not plead a repudiatory breach by the respondent, I would say no more on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The respondent claimed further that it could not have and did not agree to the terms set out in the Settlement Agreement because Mr Goel was, up to that point, still attempting to confirm the availability of funds to make payment.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defence at p 7.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This argument could not hold water. Whatever the respondent’s subjective chain of thought might have been, this was irrelevant where, as explained above, an agreement had been formed as seen from the objective indicators, namely the parties’ correspondence. In any case, the respondent’s claim that it could not confirm the availability of funds conflated the <span class="font-italic">performance</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of its contractual obligations under the contract with the <span class="font-italic">formation</span> of the contract itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For completeness, I was unable to agree with the AR’s reasoning that the appellant could not rely on the purported formation of the Settlement Agreement by correspondence in the absence of execution by the respondent because the appellant had not specifically pleaded a contract arising from the correspondence. The appellant’s pleadings in its Statement of Claim referred to the formation of the agreement by correspondence, as at paragraph 8, it stated that “the terms of a settlement agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) ... were finalised and agreed by Defendant on 13 May 2013”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It leaves me at this point to address the two other potentially triable issues raised by the respondent, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether Suit 814 ought to be reinstated given that the appellant ought to be estopped from commencing OC 139 on 19 July 2022 when, at the material time, the underlying suit in Suit 814 was still pending. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether there was uncertainty over the exact quantum of the appellant’s because the Default Judgment provided for the sum of US$251,359.75, and yet the appellant had prayed for the alternative sums of US$75,000.00 and US$251.359.75 in its own Statement of Claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 To my mind, none of these raised a triable issue. Regarding the first issue, this was moot given that the appellant had since successfully obtained leave to withdraw Suit 814, and a notice of discontinuance had been filed since. As for the second issue, there was no uncertainty as to the quantum claimed by the appellant as its claim was premised on the express terms of the Settlement Agreement, which provided essentially that the amount of US$75,000 was the amount to be paid as agreed by the parties in the Settlement Agreement, failing which the amount of US$251,359.75 would become immediately due and payable forthwith. The Default Judgment correctly provided for the judgment sum of US$251,359.75 in light of the respondent’s failure to make payment of the sum of US$75,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was an inordinate delay by the respondent in filing the present application to set aside the Default Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Lastly, the appellant submitted that there was an inordinate delay on the respondent’s part in filing the application to set aside the Default Judgment, such that this ought to be an additional reason weighing against the respondent. While this would not be dispositive of the present appeal, I would nonetheless record my view that there was a reasonable explanation on the respondent’s part for its delay. The appellant stressed that it was “impossible”

In particular, Mr Goel first caught wind of the Default Judgment via an email from the receptionist of the co-working space regarding certain documents addressed to him.
