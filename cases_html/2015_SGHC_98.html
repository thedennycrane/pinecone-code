<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this involved and strenuously fought out
                    matter, a sister is challenging her brother’s right and suitability to be
                    the executor and trustee of their mother’s estate. As this is a family
                    dispute, the sad fact is that it covers years of disagreement, hurt feelings and
                    actions taken by one or another sibling in respect of their parents and each
                    other which have engendered deep-felt animosity. Thus, to decide the issues in
                    the case, there would have to be a rather thorough exploration of family history
                    and issues of the kind that most people prefer to keep securely locked away from
                    public view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This action concerns the estate (“the
                    Estate”) of Mrs Chiang Chia Liang nee Ho Fan Ching Florence
                    (“Mdm Ho”). Mdm Ho and her husband, the late
                    Mr Chiang Chia Liang (“Mr Chiang”) had three children.
                    The first child, a daughter, Dr Currie Chiang
                    (“Dr Chiang”) is an ophthalmologist by profession. The second
                    child, another daughter and a trained accountant, is Shirley Chiang, the
                    plaintiff in this action. The youngest child and only son is Chiang Dong Pheng,
                    the defendant in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Under Mdm Ho’s will, the defendant
                    was appointed to be the executor of the will and trustee of the Estate. The
                    plaintiff contends that the defendant is unfit to be executor and would like the
                    court to remove him and appoint her as executrix in his place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General details about the Chiang family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mr Chiang was an engineer from Taiwan who
                    became a successful businessman with companies in the chemical business in
                    Singapore and Malaysia. Mdm Ho and his children were officers of these
                    companies at various times. As Mr Chiang grew older and played less part in
                    the business, the defendant took over his role. He has worked for the family
                    company, Standard Chemical Corporation Pte Ltd (“SCC”), for over
                    30 years and has been its managing director since 1988. The defendant is also
                    the managing director of the family’s property company, Chiang Properties
                    Pte Ltd (“CPPL”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mdm Ho was a housewife and mother. She did
                    not run any of the Chiang family companies but she managed the family’s
                    finances and acquired various properties for the family. She looked out for
                    opportunities to invest and increase the wealth of the family. She was a very
                    capable woman and managed almost all the family’s investment properties,
                    keeping them tenanted and collecting rental.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sometime in the 1980s, Mr Chiang, while
                    remaining married to Mdm Ho, moved out of the family residence and set up a
                    new home with his mistress, one Ms Wen Jen Jiao
                    (“Ms Wen”). A son was born out of this relationship.
                    Mr Chiang bought two apartments in Singapore in the name of Ms Wen and
                    resided in one of these with her and their son. According to the defendant,
                    Mdm Ho, although understandably very upset, accepted the situation and
                    concentrated thereafter on protecting the family wealth by making sure all money
                    and other assets were kept out of Mr Chiang’s reach for fear that he
                    might otherwise be pressured into transferring the same to
                Ms Wen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Between them, Mr Chiang and Mdm Ho
                    owned eight houses and apartments in Singapore. They are the following:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The
                        Chiang family home was 5 Harlyn. Mdm Ho remained there after
                        Mr Chiang moved out. The other properties were bought as investments
                        and, accordingly, were kept tenanted as much as
                possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events from 1998 to 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In 1998, Mr Chiang had a terrible fall.
                    Thereafter, his health deteriorated. Sometime in 2002, Mr Chiang moved to
                    live with the defendant in the latter’s home at 27 Merryn Road. At
                    that time the plaintiff lived next door at 27A Merryn Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In March 2002, Mdm Ho, the defendant and
                    Dr Chiang made an application (“OS 936”) under the
                    Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap 178, 1985 Rev Ed) for an order in
                    respect of the person and estate of Mr Chiang. Medical evidence was
                    produced that Mr Chiang was suffering from dementia and did not understand
                    what was happening around him and was not able to look after himself and his
                    affairs. The defendant initially objected to the application but subsequently
                    wanted to become a member of the Committee. On 14 August 2002, an order was made
                    in OS 936 appointing Mdm Ho and all her children to be the committee
                    of the person and estate of Mr Chiang (“the Committee”). The
                    order specifically empowered the Committee to do the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     To operate Mr Chiang’s
                        current account No 01-4xxx with Overseas Union Bank;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     To execute, on behalf of and in the
                        name of Mr Chiang, certain documents which he had to sign to apply for
                        replacement share certificates in his name;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     To execute, on behalf of Mr Chiang, all
                        documents relating to utilisation of his CPF savings; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     Generally, to manage his personal and
                        real property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Chiang died on 26 June 2009. By his
                    will, which he had made in June 1994, Mr Chiang made the following
                    appointments and gifts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     He appointed Ms Ong Chai Hong
                        (“Ms Ong”), a former employee of SCC, to be the executrix
                        and trustee of his will.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     He bequeathed his shares in SCC to his wife and children
                        as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       50 shares to
                            Mdm Ho;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       700 shares to the defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       2,140 shares to
                            Dr Chiang; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       2,140 shares to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     In respect of his real properties, he made the following specific
                        gifts:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       17C Dublin was given
                            to Mdm Ho; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       33 Merryn was given to
                        Ms Wen.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, he gave all his other real and personal property to
                        Mdm Ho and his three children in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mdm Ho died some two months later on 18
                    August 2009. By her will made on 27 May 2004, she made the following
                    appointments and bequests:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     She appointed the defendant to be
                        the sole executor and trustee of her will.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     She gave her children the following
                        houses:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       To the defendant,
                            5 Harlyn and 70 Oriole;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       To Dr Chiang, 72 Oriole;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       To
                            the plaintiff, 68 Oriole.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>Each
                            of these gifts was expressed to be “of all my interest …
                            absolutely”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     She gave all her other property to her trustee to call in
                        and sell and convert into money and thereafter to apply the proceeds in the
                        following manner and priority:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       To pay all her debts and
                            funeral expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       To pay “all outstanding loans secured
                            by” 70 Oriole and 72 Oriole; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       To divide and distribute
                            the residue after the aforesaid payments equally among her three
                            children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A number of events took place after
                    Mdm Ho’s death in which the plaintiff and either one or both of her
                    siblings were involved which led to an intensification of the strained
                    relationship between the plaintiff and her siblings. I will deal with these when
                    I discuss the issues in the case in more detail. In the meantime, I turn to the
                    various legal proceedings and applications that the parties have been involved
                    in prior to this litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Initial actions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     No steps were taken by the defendant in the
                    months following Mdm Ho’s death to apply for probate of her will. The
                    plaintiff was not happy with this inaction. On 6 April 2010 and 2 July 2010, her
                    solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors for information relating to
                    the Estate and the status of the probate proceedings. No reply having been
                    received to either letter, on 15 July 2010, the plaintiff gave the
                    defendant notice that if he did not commence probate proceedings within 14 days
                    she was going to make an application to court. There was no response to this
                    letter either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In early September 2010, the plaintiff filed
                    caveats against the grant of probate in the Estate in both the Supreme Court and
                    the Subordinate Courts. Subsequently, on 27 September 2010, she filed a Citation
                    to Accept or Refuse Grant of Probate (“the Citation”). The
                    Citation was served on the defendant personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     She followed this up by starting Originating
                    Summons No 1088 of 2010 on 21 October 2010 (“OS 1088”).
                    This application was for an order that the defendant produce the will of
                    Mdm Ho and deposit the same in the Civil Registry of the Supreme Court. In
                    the affidavit supporting the application, the plaintiff complained that the
                    defendant had done nothing in the 14 months since Mdm Ho’s death. He
                    had not entered an appearance to the Citation and had not taken probate action.
                    The plaintiff stated that she had been advised that the defendant was deemed to
                    have renounced his right to probate under s 4 of the Probate and
                    Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Probate Act”)
                    and that she was therefore entitled to apply for a grant of Letters of
                    Administration with Will Annexed under s 13 of the Probate Act. For this
                    purpose she wanted the will to be produced and deposited in the Civil Registry
                    of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 11 November 2010, the defendant filed
                    Probate No 309 of 2010 (“P 309”) in the Supreme Court.
                    This was his application for probate to be granted to him in respect of
                    Mdm Ho’s will. Some two weeks later, he filed an appearance to
                    contest the plaintiff’s Citation proceedings and also filed a warning for
                    the removal of the caveats lodged by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 18 January 2011, the plaintiff withdrew
                    OS 1088 and was ordered to pay costs to the defendant. However, on 15 April
                    2011, the plaintiff filed an application in P 309 seeking an order that she
                    be jointly appointed with the defendant as the personal representative and
                    trustee of the Estate. The application was not successful. Instead, on 28 June
                    2011, the plaintiff was directed that if she wanted to proceed with her quest to
                    join or replace the defendant as trustee of the Estate, she would have to issue
                    a Citation against the defendant within four weeks and thereafter would have to
                    commence a writ action against him within eight weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit 820 of 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Suit No 820 of 2012
                    (“S 820”) was an action started by Mdm Ong who had obtained
                    grant of probate in respect of Mr Chiang’s estate (“the Chiang
                    Estate”) on 20 October 2010. There were five defendants to S 820:
                    the three Chiang siblings in their personal capacities, Chiang Dong Pheng as
                    personal representative of the Estate, and Ms Wen. The action was taken out
                    in order to determine the assets belonging to the Chiang Estate. The orders
                    sought by Mdm Ong were:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This action came on for
                        hearing in 2014 and part way through the trial the parties came to a

                        Estate was represented throughout by Aequitas Law Corporation

                    plaintiff on 28 July 2011 as a consequence of the earlier order in P 309.
                    The main reliefs claimed by the plaintiff are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    A declaration that the Defendant, as personal
                            representative and trustee, has acted in breach of fiduciary duty and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff has represented herself since
                    the start of this litigation. She has drafted and filed all her own pleadings
                    and affidavits. When the case came to trial, she conducted the cross-examination
                    of the defendant and his witnesses herself. Due to the fact that the plaintiff
                    is not a lawyer, although she obviously spent a lot of time researching the law
                    and preparing her case, there were occasions on which irrelevant matters were
                    brought up in court. Some of these matters have also been brought up in her
                    closing submissions. In order to be fair to the defendant therefore, I think it
                    important to emphasise that in dealing with this case and considering the
                    plaintiff’s allegations, I will only deal with and consider those
                    allegations that were pleaded in the statement of claim. Any unpleaded
                    allegations would not be relevant in determining whether the plaintiff is
                    entitled to the relief that she has claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Moving to the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff amended this twice. The second amendment was filed on 4 January 2012.
                    The essence of the plaintiff’s case resides in her allegation in
                    para 3 that it is inappropriate for the defendant to be appointed sole
                    executor of the Estate because: (i) he has acted in breach of fiduciary duty and
                    trust; (ii) he is in conflict of interest in the administration of the Estate;
                    and (iii) he has failed to administer the Estate on a timely basis and in the
                    best interest of all beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The rest of the statement of claim which
                    follows the heading “PARTICULARS” is an elaboration of her
                    specific complaints about the defendant’s behaviour. I summarise those
                    complaints contained in paras 4 to 19 of the statement of claim as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant has diverted funds
                        belonging to the Estate into his own personal Post Office Savings Bank
                        (“POSB”) Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff was not informed of the banking of the
                        Estate’s funds into any interim account and the defendant was in
                        breach of his duty to inform and consult beneficiaries in relation to the
                        diversion;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        defendant transferred moneys out of Mr Chiang’s POSB Account
                        009-xxx into a joint account in the names of himself and Mdm Ho in
                        breach of a High Court order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     There is a conflict of interest in respect of the review
                        of transfers out of the joint accounts of the defendant and Mdm Ho to
                        Mr Chiang’s bank account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     The defendant closed two joint accounts which he held
                        with Mdm Ho before probate had been obtained;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_f"></a>(f)     The defendant showed no interest in
                        taking out probate until the plaintiff commenced OS 1088 to compel him
                        to deposit the will;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_g"></a>(g)     The defendant failed to provide information to the beneficiaries and
                        to prepare and provide timely and accurate accounts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_h"></a>(h)     There was an inordinate delay in
                        taking out probate with no acceptable reason being given for the
                        delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)     There
                        was a loss in value of investments as a result of lack of
                    review;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
                        defendant failed to consult the plaintiff as a beneficiary and failed to act
                        in accordance with his own written assertion in regard to the renewal of the
                        tenancy of 68 Oriole;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_k"></a>(k)     The plaintiff lost an opportunity to sell her home at
                        27A Merryn Road due to the defendant’s delay in handing over
                        68 Oriole to her;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_l"></a>(l)     The defendant has used moneys belonging to the Estate to
                        make interest repayments in respect of a loan which was ostensibly made to
                        CPPL but which was used by the defendant as collateral for a loan to another
                        company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_m"></a>(m)     Two of
                        the family companies under the directorship of the defendant are doing
                        badly;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_n"></a>(n)     The
                        defendant and Dr Chiang have denied having any documents in relation to
                        a huge piece of land in China in which the plaintiff has an interest as a
                        beneficiary of the Chiang Estate and the Estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_o"></a>(o)     The defendant had acted as
                            “<em>executor de son tort</em>” in
                        the Chiang Estate even though that estate had its own executor;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_p"></a>(p)     The defendant
                        had failed to provide the plaintiff with an updated Schedule of Assets of
                        the Estate even though the plaintiff had advised him that his draft Schedule
                        of Assets dated September 2009 was incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant responded by not only filing a
                    defence but also by making a counterclaim. In the defence proper, the defendant
                    denied the plaintiff’s various allegations and gave his explanation for
                    the various steps that he had taken which he asserted had been either in
                    compliance with directions from Mdm Ho or had been in the best interests of
                    the Estate. He also made certain allegations regarding the plaintiff’s
                    motivation and alleged ill intentions and certain actions that she had
                    taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant’s counterclaim is based on
                    his averment in para 26 of the same that, at various dates from the deaths of
                    her parents, the plaintiff has taken various actions and steps which are
                    detrimental to the Estate. Such matters have caused unnecessary delay, expense
                    and distress to the defendant as executor of the Estate and to the defendant and
                    Dr Chiang as beneficiaries of the estates of Mr Chiang and
                    Mdm Ho. This averment is supported by the following pleaded
                    “PARTICULARS”:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     Instigating a legal action in Taiwan
                        by contacting and informing Ms Wen of Mr Chiang’s
                        death;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Making
                        various unfounded police reports against the defendant alleging matters
                        which the defendant was fully aware of but claimed to be ignorant
                    of;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Contacting
                        various banks and making false allegations against the defendant thereby
                        affecting his reputation and good name and adversely affecting the banking
                        relationships of SCC, CPPL and Dr Chiang;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     Making repeated unfounded allegations against
                        the defendant’s good name and reputation with tenants thereby causing
                        embarrassment to the defendant and confusion over the management and
                        collection of rentals of various properties belonging to the
                    Estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     Intentionally making allegations to the solicitor and executor of the
                        Chiang Estate which the plaintiff knows to be unfounded regarding the Chiang
                        Estate and thereby delaying the distribution of that estate;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     Taking
                        possession of No 68 Oriole without accounting for rent which should be
                        $16,000 per month together with loss and damage to the property due to the
                        plaintiff’s failure to maintain it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As reliefs for the plaintiff’s alleged
                    actions, the defendant wants damages to be assessed and an order prohibiting the
                    plaintiff from taking any steps or interfering in any way with the issue of
                    grant of probate to the defendant for the Estate. He also wants costs on an

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law relating to the passing over of executors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Probate Act governs the grant of probate
                    and letters of administration in respect of the estate in Singapore of a
                    deceased person. Under Singapore law, which is derived from English common law,
                    non-Muslim persons domiciled in Singapore are free to direct how their estates
                    should be managed and distributed after their deaths by making a will. In this
                    will, the testator may nominate a person to be the executor of his will. Whilst
                    such nomination will usually be given effect to, it is not a foregone conclusion
                    that the person nominated by the testator will eventually become the
                    administrator of the estate. There are certain situations in which the court may
                    appoint someone else to administer the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In this regard, s 8(1) of the Probate Act
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>8. —(1</b>)    Probate
                                <em>may be</em> granted to any executor
                            appointed by a will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is generally accepted that this wording
                    reposes a discretion in the court as to whether it will grant probate to the
                    person named in the will (see: <em>Halsbury’s Law of
                        Singapore</em>, vol 15, para 190.021 (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”) at p 263). Under O 71 r 4(1)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”), the court has the duty to make “all
                    enquiries which [it] may see fit to make” before allowing any grant to be
                    issued. The extent of the court’s power to refuse to issue a grant to the
                    named executor seems, however, to still be in issue. It may be contended (and
                    this seems to be implied by para 190.022 of <em>Halsbury’s</em>) that the discretion is circumscribed by the
                    circumstances set out in s 13(1) of the Probate Act which deals with
                    various situations in which the executor appointed by the will cannot take up
                    the appointment. These include legal incapacity which may be due to infancy or
                    mental or physical incapacity (situations which are covered by O 71
                    rr 27 and 29) and the fact that the named executor has pre-deceased the
                    testator. There is also s 55 of the Probate Act which empowers the court to
                    grant probate to someone other than the named executor if that person fails to
                    apply for a grant within six months of the death of the testator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It would appear, however, that leading
                    commentators consider that the court’s discretion to pass over a named
                    executor is not limited to the situations set out in ss 13 and 55. I also
                    note that under s 32 of the Probate Act, any probate may be revoked
                    “for any sufficient cause”. It would seem incongruent with this
                    provision if the court were not to have the power to pass over a named executor
                    equally “for sufficient cause”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A local textbook by G Raman, <em>Probate and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“<em>Raman on
                        Probate</em>”) considers that executors may be passed over and
                    sets out, at pp 119–120, the “normal situations” in which
                    this may happen as being:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    bad character, financial position or ineptitude
                            for business of an applicant;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    the fact that he had an interest incompatible with
                            the proper administration of the estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    his minor interest in the estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    that he is personally objectionable to other
                            persons entitled to share in the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These matters are not expressly stated in the Probate Act but
                        derive from old English authority. <em>Halsbury’s</em> at para 190.035 seems to agree with the
                        first category set out above, noting that a murderer may not be permitted to
                        take a grant on the grounds of public policy and that a person who has
                        committed manslaughter is also prohibited from obtaining a grant to the
                        estate of the person whom he has killed. <em>Halsbury’s</em> relies on early twentieth century English
                        cases for these propositions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The English authorities may not, however, be
                    applicable in Singapore. In England the equivalent legislation is more specific
                    about the power of the court to pass over the named executor. The relevant
                    legislation refers to “special circumstances” which make it appear
                    to the High Court “to be necessary or expedient” to appoint as
                    administrator someone other than the person nominated in the will (s 116 of
                    the Supreme Court Act 1981 (c 54) (UK)). Academic commentators confirm that
                    the wording of this section has the same effect as earlier legislation
                    (specifically s 73 of the Court of Probate Act 1857
                    (“CPA UK”)) which also included a reference to
                    “special circumstances” and cases decided under the earlier
                    sections are still good law in England. In the earlier cases, which include
                    those cited in the Singapore texts, persons were passed over as executors on
                    account of their bad character, attempts to avoid tax and delay a proper
                    investigation of the deceased’s affairs and to waste time, neglect of
                    their duties, imprisonment, ill health or unsoundness of mind, to name a few
                    disqualifications (see: <em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on
                        Executors, Administrators and Probate</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th
                    Ed, 2008) (“<em>Williams on Probate</em>”),
                    at p 377).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In view of the differences in the wording of
                    the English and Singapore legislation, it is strongly arguable that the
                    discretion to pass over a named executor is more circumscribed in Singapore than
                    it is in England. This indeed was the position adopted in a case decided by the
                    Straits Settlements’ Court of Appeal in 1937. In <em>In the
                        Estate of Hameed Nachial alias Hameed Nachia otherwise spelt Hameed Nachia
                        Deceased</em> [1937] SSLR 33 (“<em>Hameed
                        Nachia</em>”), Mills J noted specifically that the
                    CPA UK did not apply to the Colony of Singapore (“the
                    Colony”) while Thomas CJ, who presided, also drew a distinction
                    between the CPA UK and the Probate and Administration Ordinance (Cap 51)
                    (“the Ordinance”) which governed the grant of probate in the
                    Colony. Thomas CJ noted that in England the CPA UK had introduced
                    certain exceptions to the right of a named executor to be granted probate but he
                    emphasised that the language of the CPA UK had <em>not</em> been reproduced in the Ordinance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Ordinance is a predecessor of the Probate
                    Act and it contained a s 7 which provided that probate “may be
                    granted” to any executor appointed by a will. This language is the same
                    as that of s 8 of the Probate Act. The majority judges in <em>Hameed Nachia</em> took the view that having regard to the
                    difference between the wording of s 7 and that of the CPA UK, the
                    grounds for passing over a nominated executor were only those that were
                    expressly stated in the Ordinance, for example, under ss 20 and 21 dealing
                    with infants and lunatics respectively, and the five situations mentioned in
                    s 54 thereof. If the reasoning set out in <em>Hameed
                        Nachia</em> is applied to the Probate Act, it would mean that in
                    Singapore the court does not have the power to pass over a named executor due to
                    the existence of the “special circumstances” cited in <em>Williams on Probate</em> but can only do so in the situations
                    provided for in s 13 (dealing with various situations in which executors
                    cannot act including infancy, lunacy and death) and s 55 of the Probate
                    Act, the current equivalent of s 54 of the Ordinance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 55(1) of the Probate Act reads (as far
                    as material):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>55.</b> —(1) In the following
                        cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(<em>a</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">where, after the
                                expiration of 6 months from the death of a deceased person, no

                                to his estate;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(<em>b</em>)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">where any such

                                refused;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">letters of administration with or without the will annexed may be granted
                        to the Public Trustee, or to such other person as the court thinks
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The sub-sections cited above track the
                    language of s 54(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of the Ordinance and thus have been part of our law for a
                    long time. The meaning of s 54 of the Ordinance was considered in <em>Hameed Nachia</em> and the facts of that case being somewhat
                    similar to the facts here make that decision relevant for my
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Hameed
                    Nachia</em>, the testatrix died on 30 May 1935. No application for probate
                    having been filed by either the named executors or by any other person within
                    six months from the date of death, the Solicitor-General filed a petition on 6
                    March 1936 for letters of administration to be granted to a trustee company. The
                    next day, one of the appointed executors filed a petition for probate stating
                    that the delay was due to his having been resident in India from the date of the
                    deceased’s death to the middle of January 1936. The issue before the Court
                    of Appeal was whether s 54(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Ordinance allowed for the Solicitor-General’s petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The majority of the Court of Appeal held that
                        s 54(<em>a</em>) of the Ordinance should be
                    construed such that an executor loses his right to automatic appointment if he
                    or she neglects to apply for probate within six months of the death of the
                    testator, and it does not matter if an application is subsequently filed and is
                    pending at the time of the hearing. However, this did not mean that the executor
                    would necessarily be passed over; if the executor had filed an application for
                    probate by the time that the application under s 54 was made by another
                    party, the court’s discretion whether to pass over the named executor
                    would still have to be exercised judicially. In this regard, while
                    Thomas CJ only found that the trial judge had properly exercised his
                    discretion to pass over the executor, Cussen J laid down some useful
                    guiding principles in determining how the court’s discretion under
                    s 54 of the Ordinance should be exercised (at p 47):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It remains only to consider how this discretion should be exercised and
                        its exercise in this particular case. I agree with the learned Judge that
                        this discretion is quite unfettered save that of course it must be exercised
                        judicially.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And, in my opinion, the position of the executor, even when he has brought
                        himself within the authority of this section, must still be considered. He
                        cannot be passed over arbitrarily; there is not an open, free choice as
                        between him and the other applicants or persons under consideration. There
                        must be reasonable grounds, judicially considered, for passing him over in
                        favour of the Official Assignee or any other person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The paramount consideration is always the interests of
                            the trusts of the Will. If there is evidence from which the Court, in
                            its discretion, may properly conclude that it would be undesirable and
                            unsafe to entrust the administration of the estate to the executor, then
                            the executor may be passed over</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may also be pointed out that it appears from the judgment of
                        Huggard CJ in [<em>In the Estate of Vanena Katha Pillay
                            Marican, Deceased</em> [1934] MLJ 205] that he considered that,
                        where there is jurisdiction under s 54, <em>unsuitability or dilatoriness are grounds on which an executor may be
                            passed over</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It should be noted that the trial judge had found the executor
                        to be unsuitable after observing the executor’s demeanour in the
                        witness box. The trial judge noted the executor was evasive and had given
                        contradictory answers when he was cross-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     From the decision of <em>Hameed
                        Nachia</em>, it would appear that in the present case, the
                    court’s discretion to pass over the defendant as the named executor arises
                    because his failure to make an application for a grant of probate within six
                    months from Mdm Ho’s death has brought the case within
                        s 55(<em>a</em>). The discretion has not arisen
                    simply because of the inclusion of the words “may be granted” in
                    s 8 of the Probate Act. As full argument was not addressed to me on the
                    scope of s 8 in a situation in which s 55(<em>a</em>) does not apply, I do not express a concluded view on the
                    matter. My inclination is to consider myself bound by <em>Hameed
                        Nachia</em> but it may be open for parties in future cases to question
                    whether that decision is indeed binding on the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As can be seen from the summary of the
                    “Particulars” in the statement of claim, the plaintiff here is
                    trying to establish that circumstances exist which should move the court to
                    disqualify the defendant from acting as the executor of the Estate. I will
                    consider those circumstances in the exercise of my discretion under s 55 of
                    the Probate Act. In doing so, the test laid down by Cussen J, that is,
                    whether there is evidence establishing that it will be undesirable and unsafe to
                    entrust the administration of the Estate to the defendant, will be applied. I
                    will also consider whether there are any circumstances in this case which could
                    qualify as “special circumstances” as found by the English
                    authorities because the underlying rationale for allowing such “special
                    circumstances” to determine whether an executor should be passed over
                    must be the court’s determination that the existence of such circumstances
                    make it undesirable and unsafe to entrust the administration of the Estate to
                    the named executor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I should mention that in <em>Hameed Nachia</em>, the first instance judge (the “trial
                    judge”) decided that the named executor should be passed over. None of
                    the members of the Court of Appeal were inclined to interfere with this holding.
                    From the judgment of Cussen J, it appears that the trial judge had
                    expressed the view that there were ample reasons for passing the executor over,
                    that the interest of the beneficiaries would be gravely imperilled if he were
                    given control of the estate and that it appeared to the trial judge that the
                    executor was likely to show carelessness, incompetence and negligence which
                    would result in “appalling loss and hardship” to the
                    beneficiaries. Also, his interest was opposed to that of the infant
                    beneficiaries in that he had said that he did not know that their mother,
                    Fatima, was his father’s wife whereas other evidence showed that the
                    executor and the rest of the family were well aware that these infants were
                    entitled to benefit under the will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Renunciation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff has another string to her bow:
                    this is the contention that the defendant had constructively renounced his right
                    to, and is therefore precluded from, applying for grant of probate. As this
                    contention is self-contained, I shall deal with it first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Under s 4(1) of the Probate Act, a person
                    who has an interest in the estate of a deceased person may cause to be issued a
                    citation directed to the executor appointed by the deceased’s will calling
                    upon the person cited to accept or renounce that right. Under sub-s 2, any
                    person so cited may enter an appearance to the citation but if he defaults in
                    doing so, he is deemed to have renounced his right. Following from this, under
                        s 13(1)(<em>b</em>) of the same Act, where the
                    executor appointed by will has renounced the right to act as such, letters of
                    administration with the will annexed may be granted to such person as the court
                    considers the fittest to administer the estate. Such citation must be in one of
                    the forms in Form 181 and the procedure applicable is set out in O 71
                    r 42.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Order 71 r 42 reads so far as is
                    material:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 27 September 2010, the plaintiff filed a
                    Citation in the High Court calling upon the defendant to, within eight days
                    after service of the Citation on him, enter an appearance and accept or refuse
                    probate and execution of the will of Mdm Ho. The Citation did not recite
                    the rule it was taken out under, but it is plain from the plaintiff’s
                    description of herself as a beneficiary and legatee that it was taken out under
                    r 42(1). The Citation was served on the defendant on 5 October 2010. This
                    meant that the defendant had until 13 October 2010 to enter appearance. The
                    defendant, however, did not enter his appearance to the Citation by that date.
                    Instead, about a month later, on 11 November 2010, he filed his application
                    for grant of probate. The defendant only entered appearance to the Citation on 9
                    December 2010. The plaintiff submitted that, by failing to enter appearance
                    within the specified time, the defendant had renounced probate and was no longer
                    entitled to it. It is plain from a reading of r 42(4) that the
                    defendant did not comply with the rule because he should have entered appearance
                    before applying for the grant and should then have filed an affidavit showing
                    that he had entered an appearance and stating that he had not been served by the
                    plaintiff with notice of any application for a grant to herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant submitted that he had not
                    renounced his right to a grant by failing to enter appearance to the Citation
                    within eight days. He argued that s 4 of the Probate Act read with
                    O 71 r 41(6) makes it clear that an appearance that is entered after
                    service of a Citation, even after eight days, can be accepted as long as the
                    citor has not applied under r 42(5) for a grant to herself. In this case,
                    the plaintiff did not apply for a grant to herself before 11 November 2010.
                    Therefore, it did not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to argue that the
                    defendant was precluded from entering an appearance to the Citation after eight
                    days. The plaintiff was aware that the defendant had acted as executor and she
                    had received letters from the defendant’s solicitors regarding the
                    Schedule of Assets. Shortly after she filed the Citation, the defendant’s
                    solicitors had informed her that the defendant intended to apply for the grant.
                    The plaintiff therefore had no basis, whatsoever, to assume that the defendant
                    intended to renounce his right as executor of the will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In my opinion, the defendant is right in
                    contending that the plaintiff knew that he wished to accept the appointment and
                    administer the Estate. Shortly after Mdm Ho’s death, the defendant
                    began to intermeddle in the Estate. On 24 August 2009, he closed a joint account
                    which he had with Mdm Ho and into which rentals from her properties were
                    deposited. He transferred the balance from the joint account into a new account
                    in his own name. His reason for these actions was that he did not want the
                    income of the Estate to be frozen before the grant was issued. Thereafter, he
                    took steps to have rental income paid into his new account which he operated as
                    an Estate account. He also attempted to deal with the renewal of the tenancy of
                    68 Oriole on the basis that he was the executor named in the will. The
                    plaintiff was aware of all this and knew very well that the defendant was
                    purporting to exercise the powers of an executor even though he had not applied
                    for probate yet. On 29 October 2010, the defendant’s lawyers wrote to the
                    plaintiff’s lawyers stating that as the Singapore affairs of
                    Mr Chiang had been settled, they were filing the application for probate to
                    be granted to the defendant. If the plaintiff had not known prior to that date
                    that the defendant wanted to be executor, she knew it on that date. Yet the
                    plaintiff did not, as she could have, filed an application under s 55 for
                    probate to be granted to her because the defendant had not filed his application
                    within time and had not yet entered appearance to the Citation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As I have pointed out, the defendant did not
                    follow the Rules in relation to entry of appearance and filing of his probate
                    application. These failures on his part constituted irregularities only, not
                    illegalities. The defendant was still able to file his probate action, and he
                    did so before any other probate application was filed. In all the circumstances,
                    I conclude that the defendant did not actually, or constructively, renounce his
                    right to probate. Notwithstanding that there was no renunciation, by his very
                    failure to apply for probate within six months of Mdm Ho’s death, the
                    defendant brought himself within the bounds of s 55 of the Probate Act and,
                    as Cussen J put it, “lost his favoured position at the expiration of
                    the period and his right to a grant [became] subject to the discretion given to
                    the Court by this section” (<em>Hameed Nachial</em>
                    at p 46).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion and analysis of the grounds on which the plaintiff
                contends the defendant should be passed over</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The focus of this part of the judgment is on
                    whether the various grounds put forward by the plaintiff establish that it would
                    be undesirable and unsafe to entrust the administration of the Estate to the
                    defendant. In her submissions, the plaintiff has referred to the duties of a
                    trustee and argued that various actions taken by the defendant are in breach of
                    his duties as a trustee and he should be removed as such. This is not quite the
                    right way of looking at the matter as what is being considered is not the
                    removal of a trustee but whether the defendant should be confirmed in that
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff’s position is that the
                    defendant owed the Estate “fiduciary duties as trustee and personal
                    representative” and these duties included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     not to mix Estate money with his own
                        money or with money from other estates;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     not to convert for his own use any of the funds
                        of the Estate before distribution;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     to avoid any potential conflict of interest and not to
                        act for his own personal benefit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     to comply with all court orders, practice directions and
                        Rules of Court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     to properly and completely list all assets of the
                    Estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     to take up
                        probate application and effect distribution on a timely
                    basis;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_g"></a>(g)     to provide
                        accurate, complete and timely accounts of the Estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_h"></a>(h)     to consult and give effect to the
                        wishes of beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_i"></a>(i)     to be even-handed and act fairly towards all
                        beneficiaries; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_j"></a>(j)     to act honestly and reasonably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I will consider which of the alleged duties,
                    if any, were owed by the defendant at the same time as I consider the
                    plaintiff’s grounds for contending that the defendant should be passed
                    over. These grounds are set out in her statement of claim and repeated at [22]
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Diversion of Estate funds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiff’s complaint in para 4 of
                    the statement of claim was that the defendant had diverted funds belonging to
                    the Estate into his own personal POSB Account xxx93-6 and, shortly after her
                    death, tenants of properties owned by Mdm Ho were instructed to pay rental
                    into that bank account. The defendant had acted in breach of duty to inform and
                    consult all beneficiaries if funds were so diverted and was liable to account to
                    the Estate for moneys so diverted. He had also caused the Estate to be deprived
                    of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The defendant denied having diverted all the
                    Estate’s funds. He stated that the plaintiff informed the banks of
                    Mdm Ho’s death knowing that this would cause the bank accounts to be
                    frozen and that payments made to the accounts would be rejected. This would
                    cause loss to the Estate. On 24 August 2009, POSB sent an officer to
                    Mdm Ho’s wake to verify her death. Thereafter, deposits for rental
                    were not accepted. As an interim measure, until an estate account could be
                    opened, tenants were informed to bank their cheques into an interim account.
                    This was done purely for expediency and no money was used for the personal
                    benefit of the defendant. The account opened by the defendant was POSB Account
                    xxx93-6. I shall hereafter refer to it as “the Interim
                    Account”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In court, the defendant produced evidence that
                    all bank accounts in the sole name of Mdm Ho remained in existence. He had
                    not closed them. He relied on the evidence given by an officer of the POSB
                    that, upon the death of an account holder, although money could be received into
                    the account, no  money could be withdrawn from such account until the
                    grant of probate had been obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The defendant’s own evidence was that
                    the rents for 68, 70 and 72 Oriole were due at the same time and he
                    received a complaint that there had been difficulties with one payment because
                    Mdm Ho’s accounts were frozen. He decided to act quickly to avoid
                    complaints from the other tenants. Therefore, he established the Interim
                    Account, a new account in his sole name, to be used as an interim estate
                    account. Thereafter, the tenants were instructed to pay rental into the Interim
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Further, the defendant and Mdm Ho had a
                    joint account with the POSB, Account No xxx46-8 (“Account
                    46-8”) which could be operated by the defendant acting alone.
                    Account 46-8 contained money belonging to Mdm Ho. It also contained
                    funds which had been transferred into Account 46-8 from a POSB account in
                    the name of Mr Chiang, <em>viz</em>, Account xxx99-0
                    (“CCL’s Account”). On 24 August 2009, the defendant
                    transferred the balance in Account 46-8, the sum of $1,236,233.17, into the
                    Interim Account. He then closed Account 46-8. He was able to do this
                    because he was a joint account holder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff submitted that there was no
                    necessity for the establishment of the Interim Account because rental accruing
                    due to the Estate could have been banked into any of Mdm Ho’s
                    personal accounts. She contended that the defendant was not entitled to put the
                    Estate’s money into the Interim Account because that was his own account
                    and not an account belonging to the Estate. The defendant should not have closed
                    Account 46-8 before obtaining the grant of probate. Instead, it was his
                    duty to list this bank account in the Schedule of Assets of the Estate. The
                    defendant’s actions were a breach of the defendant’s duty to act
                    honestly and in good faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The defendant explained that he had opened the
                    Interim Account purely for expediency and that no money from it was used for his
                    personal benefit. He had taken action because he was the person who had been
                    managing all the Chiang family properties and finances on his parents’
                    instructions. The Interim Account received the Estate’s funds and was used
                    to pay the expenses of the Estate. Further, all payments were by cheque or by
                    GIRO and supported by vouchers. All the bank statements and vouchers had been
                    disclosed to the plaintiff. Further, a complete account of transactions in
                    CCL’s Account had been prepared and audited by Messrs Lau Chin Huat &amp;
                    Co (Certified Public Accountants) (“LCH &amp; Co”) and
                    copies of the same together with supporting invoices had been given to the
                    Chiang Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As I see it, in relation to the administration
                    of the Estate and the handling of money due to it prior to the grant of probate,
                    the defendant had three options. First, he could have banked payments to the
                    Estate into Account 46-8 or any of Mdm Ho’s sole accounts. This
                    course, however, would have meant that there would be no money in his hands to
                    fund the expenses of the Estate and, if he wanted to prevent the Estate from
                    incurring indebtedness, he would have had to pay the same from his own funds.
                    His second alternative was to leave all Mdm Ho’s accounts,
                    including Account 46-8, as they were and start a new account to receive
                    future payments to the Estate and fund future expenses of the Estate. The
                    disadvantage of this course would be that there might not be enough money in the
                    new account to fund the expenses. The third alternative was to do what he did,
                    which was to transfer the funds in Account 46-8, the only account that he
                    could operate after Mdm Ho’s death, to a new account in his name
                    which he could operate as an estate account. The advantage of this course was
                    that it put funds in his hands to deal with the Estate’s liabilities.
                    However, he had the obligation not to intermingle these Estate funds with his
                    own money and he also had to keep proper accounts of the receipts and
                    expenditure which were made into and from the Interim Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant did furnish the plaintiff with
                    accounts of the Interim Account. The plaintiff called her husband, Mr Lim Tong
                    Huat, as an expert witness to give evidence on these accounts. Whilst Mr Lim
                    cannot be accorded the status of an independent expert in view of his intimate
                    connection with the plaintiff, some parts of his evidence can be used. In court,
                    Mr Lim accepted that the exact credit balance from Account 46-8 had been
                    transferred to the Interim Account by the defendant. The plaintiff, however, was
                    not willing to make a similar concession and would not agree that all funds from
                    Account 46-8 had gone into the Interim Account. She persisted in her belief
                    that funds had been transferred into some other account of the defendant and
                    converted by him. This was stubborn and unreasonable and does not show the
                    plaintiff in a good light.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I have concluded that the defendant was not in
                    breach of any duty when he closed Account 46-8 and transferred the balance
                    into the Interim Account. I accept that he did this in order to have funds to
                    administer the Estate and to have a bank account into which amounts paid to the
                    Estate after Mdm Ho’s death could be deposited and withdrawn as and
                    when necessary for the purposes of settling the liabilities of the Estate. He
                    did not intend to convert the moneys in the account. The defendant has kept
                    accounts of all payments into and out of the Interim Account, and the plaintiff
                    has not been able to show any discrepancy in these accounts. The plaintiff has
                    made allegations of wrongful payments made by the defendant using Estate funds.
                    Those allegations, if established, would constitute a separate ground on which
                    the defendant could possibly be found to be unsuitable to be appointed executor.
                    I will deal with those allegations later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendant could have handled the matter of
                    Account 46-8 differently but the plaintiff’s complaints in regard to
                    the closure of the account are technicalities only and do not relate to
                    substance. The defendant was not obliged to inform the beneficiaries before
                    closing Account 46-8 or to obtain their consent to this action. The defendant
                    has at all times recognised that the money in Account 46-8 belonged to the
                    Estate and that having intermeddled with it, he has a duty to account for
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Transfer of money from CCL’s Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In para 5 of the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff pleaded that the defendant had transferred money from CCL’s
                    Account into Account 46-8. These transfers started in 2002 after the
                    formation of the Committee and continued until shortly after Mdm Ho’s
                    death. In November 2004, the balance in CCL’s Account was $986,426.96 but
                    on 24 August 2009 it was only $78,147.09. The plaintiff had informed
                    Ms Ong, as the executor of the Chiang Estate, of the withdrawals. On 6 May
                    2011, the defendant returned $600,000 to the Chiang Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had
                    acted in contempt of court and in breach of trust in effecting the transfer of
                    money from CCL’s Account into Account 46-8. She asserted she had
                    suffered loss as a beneficiary of the Chiang Estate and no longer had access to
                    the money in CCL’s Account which belonged to all three
                    children/beneficiaries of Mr Chiang and not to the defendant alone. She
                    further asserted that there was a further $308,279.87 which had to be returned
                    to the Chiang Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In his defence, the defendant set out the
                    matters relating to the appointment of the Committee. He stated that after the
                    appointment of the Committee, Mdm Ho controlled all the financial affairs
                    of the Chiang family and directed the defendant to deal with the Chiang family
                    wealth according to her wishes. The plaintiff had full knowledge of this.
                    Mdm Ho directed the defendant to transfer money from CCL’s Account to
                    Account 46-8 in order to avoid any dissipation or claim by any third party
                    such as Ms Wen. The defendant pleaded that all moneys in CCL’s
                    Account had been accounted for and returned to the Chiang Estate. The matters
                    raised by the plaintiff were irrelevant to the issue of grant of probate in
                    relation to the Estate as such matters concerned only the Chiang Estate which
                    had no issue with the transfers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In her closing submissions, the plaintiff
                    asserted that the defendant had mixed the funds of the Estate with funds from
                    CCL’s Account and, in doing so, had breached his duty to properly
                    account for Estate moneys.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This might be the appropriate point to say
                    something about the dynamics of the Chiang family. The defendant was the
                    youngest child but only son. It appears that his parents reposed a great deal of
                    confidence in him and entrusted much of the running of the family businesses and
                    their finances to him. The daughters were shareholders and directors of the
                    family companies but were not involved in their operations. Dr Chiang had
                    her own career as an ophthalmologist. She seems to have been on good terms with
                    her brother throughout and is now aligned with him in this litigation. The
                    plaintiff, the middle child, trained as an accountant and worked in a bank for a
                    few years but has not practised accountancy or undertaken business for a long
                    time. She has been at odds with her siblings for some years and has taken
                    certain actions in relation to Mr Chiang which they did not agree with. The
                    plaintiff was removed as a director of SCC in 2004 although she was reinstated
                    some years later. The defendant asserted that during the lifetime of his
                    parents, the plaintiff did not provide care for them and was estranged from the
                    family. It is notable that when the decision was taken in 2002 to apply for the
                    appointment of the Committee, Mdm Ho, Dr Chiang and the defendant
                    acted together. The plaintiff was left out. Subsequently, after an initial
                    opposition, the plaintiff became part of the Committee. The defendant asserted
                    that thereafter the plaintiff did not participate in any matter relating to
                    Mr Chiang and everything was handled by him on the instructions of
                    Mdm Ho. It is clear from this assertion that the defendant never consulted
                    Dr Chiang or the plaintiff on matters relating to Mr Chiang’s
                    financial affairs. The animosity between the plaintiff and her siblings is still
                    in evidence. The plaintiff must shoulder her share of the blame for this
                    situation because she has made complaints to various authorities about her
                    siblings as a result of which they have been subject to various
                    investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Whilst Dr Chiang may have been content
                    for Mdm Ho and the defendant to deal with Mr Chiang’s affairs,
                    in law, it was not correct for the two of them to take matters into their own
                    hands and act without consulting the other members of the Committee. The
                    Committee was appointed as a whole and the members therefore had to act jointly
                    rather than severally. It was not correct for Mdm Ho and the defendant to
                    transfer funds from CCL’s Account into Account 46-8 which was in their
                    joint names. The money should either have been left where it was or transferred
                    into an account in the names of all the members of the Committee and stated to
                    be held on trust for Mr Chiang. That way, there would have been no danger
                    of intermingling Mr Chiang’s funds with money belonging to any other
                    family member, including Mdm Ho and the defendant. I accept the
                    defendant’s evidence that he made these transfers on the instructions of
                    Mdm Ho. That does not totally excuse him, however. As an adult and member
                    of the Committee, he was in a fiduciary position and could not simply comply
                    with his mother’s wishes. He should have consulted the other members of
                    the Committee and taken legal advice. However, the plaintiff not being the legal
                    representative of the Chiang Estate is not in a position to ask for any relief
                    in relation to these transfers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The defendant has returned money to the Chiang
                    Estate. Whether the amount returned is correct is not a matter for decision in
                    this action. There is, as far as I am aware, no claim by the Chiang Estate
                    against the Estate for any more money. It is worth noting that in the Judgment
                    recording the settlement of S 820, it has been expressly provided that the
                    plaintiff here shall not make any claim against the defendant here in respect of
                    the withdrawal of moneys from CCL’s Account prior to the death of
                    Mr Chiang. Thus, the plaintiff can no longer complain that as a beneficiary
                    of the Chiang Estate she has been adversely affected by those
                    withdrawals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The defendant’s actions in relation to
                    CCL’s Account cannot be regarded as a breach of any duty in relation to
                    the Estate. They may, however, affect my assessment of his suitability to be
                    appointed as the executor of the Estate. In this respect, I accept that his
                    motives were to protect the Chiang family against loss of Mr Chiang’s
                    assets and that Mdm Ho was very concerned about this due to
                    Mr Chiang’s relationship with Ms Wen. I also note that
                    Dr Chiang testified that the plaintiff had been present at family meetings
                    during which Mdm Ho had told her children that she was carrying out
                    transfers from CCL’s Account in order to safeguard the funds from third
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conflict of interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The plaintiff complains that the defendant is
                    in a conflict of interest position in relation to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     the moneys withdrawn from
                        CCL’s Account and deposited into Account 46-8;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     the deposit of
                        rental income from 68 Oriole into Account 46-8 instead of into an
                        account that was in the names of Mr Chiang and Mdm Ho who were the
                        joint owners of 68 Oriole until Mr Chiang’s
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>She contends that since these
                        transfers and deposits were effected by the defendant, he would not be able
                        to carry out an objective review to ascertain how much money has been
                        erroneously put into Account 46-8. An independent reviewer is
                        needed for this job.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendant denied that there was a conflict
                    of interest. He averred that the plaintiff knew all along that all money
                    belonging to Mr Chiang and which arose from the Chiang family properties
                    were handled by Mdm Ho. The rental income was used to repay loans taken out
                    by Mr Chiang and Mdm Ho for the family businesses. The plaintiff was
                    aware of this as a director and shareholder of the companies. Further, separate
                    accountancy professionals had audited the accounts of the Estate and those of
                    the Chiang Estate. These professionals have not raised any objections to the way
                    in which the rentals have been dealt with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendant has procured an independent
                    professional review of the amounts transferred from CCL’s Account to
                    Account 46-8. This review was accepted by the accountants of the Chiang
                    Estate. Further, Mdm Ho was a joint owner of 68 Oriole. Thus, during
                    her lifetime she was entitled to decide how to use the income of that property
                    and could direct the defendant to pay the rental into Account 46-8. The
                    only person who could challenge that decision was Mr Chiang/his legal
                    representative. No such challenge has been mounted. Further, the evidence was
                    that even before the appointment of the Committee, Mdm Ho had managed the
                    rental income of the family properties. On an overall consideration of the
                    circumstances, I am satisfied that the defendant is not in a conflict of
                    interest position in relation to the matters stated in [71] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Closure of bank accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiff averred in her statement of
                    claim that two joint accounts which Mdm Ho had with the defendant had been
                    wrongfully closed shortly after Mdm Ho’s death. One of these accounts
                    was Account 46-8. I have already dealt with that account and need say no
                    more about it. As for the other account named by the plaintiff,
                    POSB Account xxx48-1, the defendant produced the passbook for this
                    account in court. This showed that the account was held by Mdm Ho solely
                    and that it was not closed after her death. The account was still in existence.
                    Accordingly, there was no merit in the plaintiff’s allegation in relation
                    to POSB Account xxx48-1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Delay in taking out probate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In para 8 of the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff complained about the defendant’s delay in applying for probate
                    and how she had to serve a Citation on him and also take out proceedings to
                    compel him to deposit Mdm Ho’s will in the Registry of the Supreme
                    Court. She also pleaded that his application for probate was irregular and that
                    he had constructively renounced his rights to probate. In para 10 of the
                    statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded that there was no acceptable reason
                    for the inordinate delay in applying for probate. She renewed this complaint in
                    her closing submissions alleging that the real reason for the delay was to avoid
                    the distribution of assets to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I have dealt with the points on irregularity
                    and constructive renunciation above. It remains for me to consider whether the
                    dilatoriness of the defendant renders him unsuitable for appointment. This would
                    depend on the reason for the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The defendant submitted that there was no
                    inordinate delay in applying for grant of probate. In his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, he explained that he thought it would be premature to proceed
                    with administration of the Estate until all matters and assets due from the
                    Chiang Estate had been got in for a proper and complete account. There were
                    complications here such as a suit in respect of the Chiang Estate started in
                    Taiwan by Ms Wen (“the Taiwanese action”). However, in the
                    meantime, he had done a great deal of preparatory work such as writing to the
                    banks and stock exchange and obtaining valuations of the Estate’s real
                    assets. He stated that because of “the complexity of relationship,
                    distrust and disharmony” that existed, he had been advised that the most
                    prudent thing to do was to wait for probate to the Chiang Estate to be granted
                    before he proceeded in respect of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The desire to wait for the Chiang Estate to be
                    settled was the explanation given in these proceedings. In November 2010, when
                    the defendant filed the probate application, he had to give a reason for his
                    delay. He did not give the same explanation then. Instead, he said he was
                    “ignorant of the law”. I consider that to be a disingenuous
                    explanation. The defendant was legally advised at all material times and could
                    not have been ignorant of the requirement to file for probate within six months
                    of Mdm Ho’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I also think that desiring to wait for a grant
                    to the Chiang Estate to be made was not a very good reason for delaying the
                    application here. There was work to be done for the Estate, especially in regard
                    to the collection of rents and the handling of tenants. Quite soon after
                    Mdm Ho’s death, the defendant was confronted with the need to open an
                    account to handle payments to and from the Estate. It would, therefore, have
                    been more prudent for him to apply as soon as he could for the grant so that the
                    period of intermeddling with the Estate would have been shortened. Further, even
                    though administration of the Estate could not be fully completed until the
                    Chiang Estate had been distributed, the defendant would have had an earlier
                    start at gathering and controlling the assets Mdm Ho owned in her own right
                    and not by virtue of inheritance from Mr Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     On the other hand, although the defendant was
                    slow in applying for the grant, he was not slow in taking control of
                    Mdm Ho’s assets to the extent that he could and in dealing with them
                    as best he could prior to the application for the grant. He did encounter some
                    difficulty with the tenant of 68 Oriole because of the absence of the
                    grant, but apart from that there was no evidence that the assets of the Estate
                    were in any way prejudiced by reason of the delay. I note that Dr Chiang
                    had no complaint about the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     On an overall consideration, I think that I
                    must weigh delay as one of the factors when assessing the defendant’s
                    suitability. From the beginning, he was intent on being the executor – the
                    delay was not due to any reluctance or disinclination to take on the task. He
                    was aware from the various letters that the plaintiff’s solicitors sent
                    him that she was anxious about the administration of the Estate but he simply
                    ignored these letters and did not explain his reasons for not acting
                    immediately. This may be an indication of the defendant’s unhelpful
                    attitude towards the plaintiff. Though I accept that the plaintiff is an
                    extremely pushy person who is capable of unremitting nagging, as a beneficiary
                    of the Estate it is not unreasonable for her to expect some efficiency in its
                    administration. Further, as I have mentioned above, the reason for the delay was
                    not compelling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to provide information and accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     This complaint, detailed in para 9 of the
                    statement of claim, was that despite repeated requests for various information,
                    the defendant had only supplied accounting and bank statements on 28 June 2011
                    and, upon review, the same were found to be inadequate. The plaintiff was unable
                    to ascertain if the defendant had made refunds to the Estate after her discovery
                    of his transfer or diversion of funds belonging to the Estate. Further, the
                    plaintiff had to spend $25,000 to get a set of Estate accounts for review and
                    information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In closing, the plaintiff submitted that
                    Mdm Ho had had bank accounts in the Hong Kong branches of ANZ Bank and
                    HSBC that the defendant had not disclosed. She asserted that he had not included
                    all the assets of Mdm Ho in the Schedule of Assets and he wanted to hide
                    her bank accounts. As a trustee, he was required to provide information
                    requested by the beneficiaries and he had not done so in relation to these
                    accounts. She also complained that he had persistently refused to furnish Estate
                    accounts or bank statements until a summons was taken out to compel him to do
                    so. The first set of accounts was only furnished on 28 June 2011, after seven
                    letters were sent by the plaintiff’s former solicitors, and just before
                    the hearing of Summons No 1663 of 2011. The second set of accounts was listed in
                    the defendant’s list of documents after another summons hearing on 16
                    March 2012, and the third set of accounts was ordered on 27 August 2012, after
                    hearing of Summons 2620 of 2012. Although the court had ordered up-to-date
                    accounts, only accounts up to May 2013 had been furnished. As for bank
                    statements, these had been ordered but the statements furnished were only up to
                    7 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiff complained that the defendant
                    had persistently refused to furnish accounts. In his affidavit he had averred
                    that he had no obligation to disclose the accounts until after the grant of
                    probate had been issued. His solicitors had said earlier (21 January 2011) that
                    no disclosure needed to be made by the defendant as no distribution had been
                    made. Further, the accounts prepared by LCH &amp; Co only provided a
                    summary of receipts and expenses related to properties owned by Mdm Ho and
                    two properties belonging to CCL’s estate. They were not proper or complete
                    estate accounts that captured all receipts and payments made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The plaintiff cited textbook authority to the
                    effect that a trustee has a duty to keep clear and distinct accounts of the
                    property he administers and to be constantly ready with his accounts. Apart from
                        <em>Lewin On Trusts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed,
                    2008) (“<em>Lewin On Trusts</em>”) at para
                    23-22, she also relied on <em>Equity &amp; Trusts</em> by
                    Michael Haley &amp; Lara McMurtry (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2014)
                        (“<em>Haley &amp; McMurtry</em>”) for
                    this proposition. Para 13.13 of the latter text states that every beneficiary is
                    entitled to inspect the trust accounts and that if the beneficiary wants a copy
                    of the accounts, the beneficiary has to pay for them. The beneficiary may
                    challenge the accounts and the trustee is then under a duty to correct any
                    errors detected in the accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     
          <em>Haley &amp;
                        McMurtry</em> at para 13.15 also deals with the duty of a trustee to
                    provide information and documents to the beneficiaries as to the current state
                    of the trust properties and any dealings that have occurred in relation to it.
                    They opine that the trust document that a beneficiary is entitled to see is
                    essentially one that is in the possession of the trustee in his capacity as
                    trustee and which contains information about the trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     
          <em>Lewin on Trusts</em>
                    provides a slightly different perspective. It states the law as it stands after
                    the review carried out by the Privy Council in <em>Schmidt v
                        Rosewood Trust Ltd</em> [2003] 2 AC 709 (“<em>Schmidt</em>”). The text (at para 23-18) distils eight
                    principles of which the following are relevant here. First, a beneficiary has a
                    right to seek disclosure of trust documents and this right is best approached as
                    an aspect of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to supervise and, where
                    appropriate, intervene in the administration of trust. The court has a
                    discretion to decide, among other things, what classes of documents should be
                    disclosed, either completely or in redacted form, and what safeguard should be
                    imposed to limit the use which may be made of documents or information disclosed
                    under the order of court. It should be noted that in <em>Schmidt</em> the Privy Council stated that no beneficiary has any
                    entitlement as of right to disclosure of anything that can be plausibly be
                    described as a trust document. <em>Lewin On Trusts</em>
                    comments at para 23-23 that even before <em>Schmidt</em>
                    courts had accepted that there was a <em>prima facie</em>
                    right only, and no absolute entitlement to disclosure of trust documents
                    including trust accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The defendant submitted that he had acted
                    reasonably in providing documents and statements sought by the plaintiff. He
                    stated that the plaintiff had not provided any authority for the contention that
                    he had to provide for accounts on demand. His position was that his obligation
                    to provide a full account of the Estate to the beneficiaries would only arise at
                    the time of the distribution of the Estate to them. In this regard, he relied on
                    the following paragraph from <em>Raman on Probate</em> at
                    p 167:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The personal representative’s duty <em>at the end of
                            the administration of the estate</em> would be to render proper
                        accounts. In fact, the duty to render proper accounts to any beneficiary who
                        demands the same lies on the personal representative <em>throughout the administration of the estate</em>. If called upon
                        to render accounts he is obliged to provide them. It is a requirement
                            <em>before he winds up the administration</em> that
                        he submits accounts for the beneficiaries’ perusal and approval prior
                        to distribution. This is not based on any allegations of breach of trust
                        that the beneficiary may make but arises from the fiduciary relationship
                        between the trustee and the beneficiaries. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I would point out that the foregoing statement of the law does
                        not fully support the defendant’s position. <em>Raman
                            on Probate</em> indicates plainly that although at the end of
                        administration of an estate a personal representative would have to render
                        proper accounts, such personal representative is obliged to render accounts
                        during the administration of the estate if he is called upon by the
                        beneficiary to provide them. The duty in the case of a personal
                        representative is a continuing duty, much like the duty imposed on a trustee
                        as adverted to in earlier paragraphs of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Whilst both trustees and personal
                    representatives have a duty to maintain accounts and generally to provide them
                    at the beneficiary’s request, this does not mean that any beneficiary can
                    keep on demanding accounts and information without giving the trustee/personal
                    representative some respite. In my view, it is common sense that there must be
                    reasonable intervals between the demands and a trustee/personal representative
                    should not be considered to be in breach of trust simply because he does not
                    always supply the documents and information immediately upon the
                    beneficiary’s demand. Whether the trustee/personal representative has
                    complied with his duty to supply documents and information is a fact-sensitive
                    exercise in every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In the present case, the defendant took the
                    position that his obligation to provide a full account of the Estate would only
                    arise at the time of distribution of the Estate. However, he also said that he
                    had kept proper accounts of the income and expenses of the Estate since
                    Mdm Ho’s death and had appointed accountants, the said firm of
                    LCH &amp; Co, to ensure that the Estate accounts were kept in order.
                    He also appointed estate agents to rent out the properties belonging to the
                    Estate. Further, the accounting documents that he had given the plaintiff should
                    be considered a reasonable discharge of his duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The defendant’s evidence was that three
                    sets of accounts had been prepared and audited, and given to and received by the
                    plaintiff. The first set of accounts consisted of a schedule of receipts and
                    expenses for 68, 70 and 72 Oriole, 151 Cavenagh, 33 Merryn, and
                    17B and 17C Dublin. This was accompanied by various bank statements and
                    sent to the plaintiff on 28 June 2011. On 8 July 2011, the plaintiff was sent
                    copies of invoices and statements of accounts. Subsequently, the defendant sent
                    the plaintiff the accounts from 1 September 2011 to 31 August 2012, and
                    later the accounts from 1 September 2012 to 31 May 2013. Mr Lau, of
                    LCH &amp; Co who testified, confirmed that all transactions in
                    relation to the properties belonging to the Estate were accounted for and there
                    were receipts to prove these transactions. The defendant himself testified that
                    the accountants had pointed out to him that he had included some items as Estate
                    expenses which should not be charged to the Estate due to lack of proper receipt
                    documentation. He stated that he had accepted LCH &amp; Co’s
                    opinion and had repaid the Estate the items that had been wrongly debited. He
                    tendered the relevant bank slips showing such repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     This action was started on 28 July 2011. By
                    then the plaintiff had already received one set of accounts concerning the
                    properties belonging to the Estate and its bank accounts. Thereafter, the
                    plaintiff received the accounts for the period 1 September 2011 to 31 August
                    2012 and the accounts for the period 1 September 2012 to 31 May 2013. Contrary
                    to the plaintiff’s assertions, these sets of accounts were not furnished
                    in response to her chamber applications. As far as Summons No 1045 of 2012 was
                    concerned, that was a summons for general discovery in this action and not a
                    summons for the accounts after 28 June 2011. Summons No 2620 of 2012 was a
                    summons for specific documents filed in May 2012 and it was dismissed when it
                    came up for hearing. I am satisfied that the defendant did not breach his duty
                    to provide accounts even though he considered that he was not bound to do so
                    until distribution. The plaintiff had sufficient information in her hands to
                    analyse the transactions and complain about those that she thought should not
                    have been charged to the Estate. In fact, some of the subsequent amendments to
                    the statement of claim arose out of the plaintiff’s examination of the
                    accounts. I will deal with those complaints later. The fact remains that she was
                    kept apprised of what had occurred albeit not as frequently as she might have
                    liked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff complained that there were
                    certain bank accounts belonging to Mdm Ho that had not been disclosed. I am
                    satisfied from the evidence in the case that the defendant has disclosed all
                    Mdm Ho’s bank accounts. As for her complaint that she had to spend
                    $25,000 to get a set of the Estate accounts for review and information, it is
                    not clear exactly what she spent this money on. Certainly she did not pay it to
                    the defendant in exchange for the accounts. If she spent the money on employing
                    someone to review the accounts, then that expense had to be borne by her. She
                    did not cite any basis on which she could recover it from the Estate or the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As for the plaintiff’s complaint
                    regarding the bank account in Hong Kong, it is correct that in court the
                    defendant initially said that Mdm Ho had had an account with HSBC in Hong
                    Kong. At the resumed hearing, some four months later, the defendant changed his
                    position. He said that there was no account with HSBC in Hong Kong and that the
                    account he had been thinking of was actually held with the Shanghai Commercial
                    Bank Ltd in Hong Kong. He pointed out that he had disclosed statements from this
                    bank dated 17 August and 17 September 2009, in his Bundle D. These
                    statements had been sent to Mdm Ho by the Shanghai Commercial Bank Ltd in
                    respect of her fixed deposits of approximately £89,564.75 and HK$527,786.80
                    with that bank. The defendant’s counsel then showed me statements dated
                    2012 from the same bank showing that the fixed deposits had continued to be
                    rolled over every three months since Mdm Ho’s death. On the evidence,
                    I am satisfied that the defendant has disclosed the Estate’s assets in
                    Hong Kong and that he is not concealing any bank account belonging to the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loss in value of investments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Para 11 of the statement of claim contains the
                    plaintiff’s complaint that as a result of the defendant’s delay in
                    applying for probate, many of Mdm Ho’s structured foreign currency
                    bank deposits would have fallen in value as a result of the appreciation of the
                    Singapore dollar. This allegation was not dealt with in the plaintiff’s
                    closing submissions. It would appear that the plaintiff is not proceeding with
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s alleged indebtedness to CPPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Para 14 of the statement of claim is headed
                    “Defendant is indebted to [CPPL] for more than $4m/Using Estate Funds to
                    make interest repayment on this loan”. It contains the plaintiff’s
                    allegation that the defendant took a loan of about $4m which had been advanced
                    to CPPL and placed it in an account in RHB Labuan as collateral for a loan which
                    had been advanced to another family company, StanChem Sdn Bhd
                    (“StanChem”). She alleged that he was in conflict of interest
                    because he was a shareholder of CPPL. Further, the accounts of the Estate given
                    to the plaintiff on 28 June 2011 showed that the rental of 70 Oriole had
                    been used to pay interest on this loan. That was wrongful as the rental belonged
                    to the Estate and the defendant had therefore acted in breach of trust in
                    converting Estate funds to pay interest on a loan that was his sole
                    responsibility. Although 70 Oriole was willed to him, he could not use
                    Estate funds for his own interest payments before grant of probate and
                    distribution of the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The defendant denied para 14 of the statement
                    of claim and asserted that the plaintiff, as a director and shareholder of the
                    relevant companies, knew that the allegation was not true. The alleged loans
                    were not taken out by the defendant personally and the plaintiff was fully aware
                    of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In her closing submissions, the plaintiff made
                    no mention of her allegation that the defendant had, for his own benefit,
                    misused the loan extended to CPPL. She also did not repeat her assertion that he
                    had been in a conflict of interest position in relation to the use of the CPPL
                    loan. Instead, she concentrated on the assertion that the defendant had misused
                    the Estate’s funds by using the rental from 70 Oriole to pay interest
                    on the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     I am satisfied from the evidence that the
                    plaintiff’s allegations in relation to “misuse” of the loan
                    to CPPL were mischievous allegations. I accept the defendant’s
                    evidence that on Mr Chiang’s initiative a loan was originally taken
                    in 1996 by CPPL. The proceeds of this loan were put in a fixed deposit in Labuan
                    in the names of Mr Chiang, Mdm Ho, Dr Chiang and the defendant
                    and this deposit and another one were used as security for loans taken from
                    another bank to finance a project undertaken by StanChem. In 1999, the
                    defendant refinanced the StanChem loan by substituting himself as the borrower
                    with the security being provided by the same fixed deposits in the names of his
                    parents and the three siblings. The plaintiff testified that she only became
                    aware in October 2010 of the fact that the loan was for StanChem and not the
                    defendant. I am satisfied that that was not true. The plaintiff signed several
                    letters and audit confirmations as a director of StanChem. These indicate that
                    she must have known as long ago as 1999 that the relevant loan was meant for
                    StanChem and not the defendant personally. The plaintiff asserted that she had
                    signed these letters “blindly”. I do not accept that. The
                    plaintiff has shown herself to be a person who concerns herself with every petty
                    detail. She would not have signed anything blindly. I agree with the
                    defendant’s submission that it was completely unjustified of the plaintiff
                    to allege in her statement of claim and in her evidence that the defendant had
                    misused CPPL’s loan facility for his own benefit. This allegation showed
                    that the plaintiff is not adverse to distorting facts and ignoring her own
                    knowledge in order to achieve her aim of demonstrating the defendant’s
                    unsuitability to be the executor of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I turn to the issue of the alleged misuse of
                    the rental from 70 Oriole. The original loan to CPPL was secured by
                    mortgages over both 70 and 72 Oriole which were then owned jointly by
                    Mr Chiang and Mdm Ho. Subsequently, the mortgage over 72 Oriole
                    was completely redeemed. The mortgage over 70 Oriole remained and the
                    rental from that property was used to pay the interest on the loan to CPPL. The
                    defendant explained that his parents paid the interest personally because
                    Mr Chiang had directed that the proceeds of the loan be put in the fixed
                    deposit in Labuan in the names of the family members. I accept this explanation.
                    Further, the will of Mdm Ho recognises this personal obligation in relation
                    to 70 Oriole (a property of which she became the sole owner on
                    Mr Chiang’s death) by providing that the mortgage is to be redeemed
                    from the residual assets of the Estate. The plaintiff herself acknowledged this
                    direction in the will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I agree that on these facts the
                    plaintiff’s most significant complaint seems to be that the interest on
                    the loan secured by 70 Oriole was paid from the rental of that property
                    instead of by CPPL, the borrower. The defendant argued that he could use the
                    rental of 70 Oriole to pay the interest either because it formed part of
                    the residuary estate or because he could apply it to this purpose first and
                    later, if there were sufficient funds, recover the interest paid from the Estate
                    on the basis that as specific devisee of 70 Oriole, he was entitled to
                    receive all rental earned after Mdm Ho’s death, less expenses
                    relating to that property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The question that arises is whether the
                    Estate should bear the interest on the loan extended to CPPL. The answer to this
                    question depends on what Mdm Ho intended her Estate to pay. This is a
                    question of construction of the will. Clause 6(b) of
                    Mdm Ho’s Hwill directs the executor to “pay all
                    outstanding loan secured by … 70 Oriole”. The defendant
                    submitted that Mdm Ho had intended that her Estate bear both principal and
                    interest on the loan borrowed from the United Overseas Bank
                    (“UOB”) and secured by 70 Oriole. This was a matter of the
                    plain meaning of the language in the will because a loan generally carries
                    interest and the mortgage in this case secured both interest and principal. In
                    directing the executor to pay “all outstanding loans”, Mdm Ho
                    obviously meant both the principal and interest. If the expression “all
                    outstanding loans” was considered to be ambiguous, the defendant
                    submitted that the court should apply “the armchair principle” and
                    use extrinsic facts to determine the intention of the testator to resolve the
                    ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As explained in <em>Law of
                        Succession</em> by GE Dal Pont and KF Mackie
                    (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2013) at para 8.39, the armchair principle means that
                    in construing a will the court is entitled to put itself in the position of the
                    testatrix and to consider all material facts and circumstances known to the
                    testatrix with reference to which she is to be taken to have used the words in
                    the will, and then to declare what is the intention evidenced by the words the
                    testatrix used with reference to those facts and circumstances which ought to
                    have been in the mind of the testatrix when she used the words in the will. The
                    textbook took this formulation from an old (1873) English case and explained
                    that the armchair principle allowed admission of evidence of the
                    testatrix’s general knowledge and habits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Applying this principle, there is no doubt
                    on the evidence that Mdm Ho was aware that although UOB extended the loan
                    to CPPL, the purpose of the loan had nothing to do with CPPL itself. Instead,
                    the proceeds were put in a deposit in the names of the family members and used
                    to secure a loan by another bank to StanChem. All this was done on the direction
                    of Mr Chiang. I accept the evidence that Mdm Ho used her own income to
                    pay interest on this loan instead of requiring CPPL to pay such interest.
                    Mdm Ho also recognised a personal obligation to repay this loan because she
                    directed it be repaid out of her residuary estate. Thus, she did not expect CPPL
                    to repay the loan. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that on the true
                    construction of the will, Mdm Ho intended that both principal and interest
                    on the loan be paid from her residuary estate. It was not wrong for the
                    defendant to use the rental of 70 Oriole to meet the interest payments. If
                    the residual estate is solvent after payment of all liabilities, the defendant
                    would be able to recover any interest payment he has made out of the rental of
                    70 Oriole accrued since the death of Mdm Ho.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Of course, the executor of the Estate must
                    redeem the loan as soon as reasonably practicable so that the Estate does not
                    have to bear excessive interest. Redemption of the loan can only be done when
                    the executor has probate of the Estate and can realise its assets. It is
                    premature at this stage to decide when it would be reasonably practicable to
                    redeem the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">68 Oriole</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Paras 12 and 13 of the statement of claim
                    contain the plaintiff’s lengthy complaints about the way in which
                    68 Oriole was handled after Mdm Ho’s death. In August 2009, the
                    property was rented out. That tenancy was due to expire on 14 January 2011. I
                    will detail what happened thereafter before setting out the plaintiff’s
                    complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In September 2009, the defendant informed
                    the property agent, Mr Alvin Tan (“Mr Tan”), who was
                    handling the tenancies of various properties belonging to the Estate, including
                    68 Oriole, that Mdm Ho had died and that he had been appointed
                    executor by her will and had applied to court for grant of probate. He advised
                    Mr Tan that in future rental should be paid into the Interim Account.
                    Thereafter, there was some correspondence regarding the payment of rental for
                    68 Oriole as the tenant wanted to be sure that he was paying the right
                    person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    On 15 July 2010, the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors wrote to the defendant to inform him that the plaintiff intended to
                    live in 68 Oriole in the future and that, therefore, the tenancy should not
                    be renewed upon expiry. On 27 October 2010, Mr Tan informed the defendant
                    that the tenant of 68 Oriole wanted to extend the lease for another two
                    years. The tenant had also complained that a lady had gone down to the premises
                    claiming to be the new owner of the house and had tried to get into the house.
                    The lady refused to leave her name and said that the tenant must vacate at the
                    end of the lease. The tenant was perturbed by this incident. The defendant asked
                    Mr Tan to negotiate for a new rate to reflect the market rate. On 29
                    October 2010, the defendant’s solicitors informed the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors that the tenant of 68 Oriole was alarmed and anxious due to the
                    plaintiff’s recent visit to the premises. They wanted the plaintiff to be
                    advised not to cause concern or annoyance to the tenant as he was entitled to
                    quiet enjoyment of the premises. The letter went on to state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Our client will not take any steps to renew the tenancy.
                        If  your client does not want to extend the tenancy when it comes
                        up for renewal, please let us know so that this will be conveyed to the
                        tenant in the proper manner. However, if the tenancy does provide a
                        contractual right for renewal, our client will seek your client’s
                        instruction and act accordingly. Your client will be responsible for any
                        legal implication caused to our client as a result of complying with your
                        client’s decision not to renew the tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Thereafter, there were some negotiations
                    between Mr Tan and the tenant regarding renewal. The tenant was willing to
                    pay rental of $10,500 per month and Mr Tan prepared a draft tenancy
                    agreement reflecting that rate in early December 2010. In response to the
                    defendant’s enquiry, on 21 December 2010, Mr Tan informed him that the
                    prevailing rental rates in the vicinity of 68 Oriole were between $9,000
                    and $13,800 per month. On 27 December 2010, the defendant stated that he wanted
                    a rent of $12,500 per month. The tenant counter-offered $11,000 per month but,
                    by 14 January 2011, no reply had been received from the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On 15 January 2011, Mr Tan received a
                    call from the tenant asking him to contact the plaintiff who had dropped a
                    letter with several attachments into the tenant’s letterbox. In this
                    letter, the plaintiff asked the tenant to vacate the premises immediately as she
                    said the defendant had assured her that the tenancy would not be renewed. On 16
                    January 2011, the plaintiff wrote to the defendant’s solicitors stating
                    that she had found out the previous day that 68 Oriole was still tenanted
                    and wanted to know why the defendant had not followed her instructions on the
                    matter. She indicated that the proper rental for the premises would be $20,000
                    per month. The plaintiff also said that she had received a good offer for her
                    own house and had planned to move into 68 Oriole in the near future.
                    Because of the defendant’s inordinate delay in taking out probate she had
                    to forego this offer. She forbade the defendant to manage the property and asked
                    him to hand over the title deeds and the keys to her immediately. She wanted the
                    house to be vacated within seven days and threatened to take action against the
                    defendant if this was not done. On 20 January 2011, the defendant issued a
                    notice of termination of lease to the tenant. The latter moved out on 15 March
                    2011. A few days earlier, the defendant’s solicitors had informed the
                    plaintiff that the defendant agreed to the plaintiff taking possession of
                    68 Oriole as long as she accepted all risks of the property and the
                    obligation to maintain it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    On 8 April 2011, the defendant’s
                    solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors complaining, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaintiff had entered the property
                    and changed the front door locks. When the defendant went to the property he
                    could not gain access to the house. He then put a combination lock on the front
                    metal gates. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff scaled the gates in order to have
                    access to the property. Correspondence followed and after the plaintiff had
                    signed a form of indemnity in favour of the defendant, she was given possession
                    of the property. She has since undertaken renovation and repair works to
                    68 Oriole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The plaintiff’s complaints in paras 12
                    and 13 of the statement of claim in relation to 68 Oriole can be summarised
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     Despite being notified three times
                        by the plaintiff between 15 July and 21 December 2010, that the
                        plaintiff intended to live in 68 Oriole and therefore the tenancy
                        should not be renewed, the defendant engaged the tenant in negotiations for
                        renewal of the tenancy until the plaintiff found out what was going on on 15
                        January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff had found out that the tenant had been instructed to bank the
                        rental into the Interim Account. Despite offering to do so, the defendant
                        had not handed over the rental, less outgoings, to the plaintiff. Nor had
                        the defendant furnished the schedule of expenses charged against the rental
                        during the period from 18 August 2009 to 14 March 2011. The gross
                        amount of rental collected during the period was
                    $141,261.06.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        plaintiff had suffered loss of use of 68 Oriole due to the
                        defendant’s inordinate delay in taking out probate and his attempts to
                        renew the lease after it expired on 14 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff has had to expend her
                        own money in maintaining 68 Oriole and wishes to undertake renovations
                        of the property which is in disrepair but is unable to do so due to the
                        delay in administration of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_e"></a>(e)     Believing that the defendant would not renew the tenancy
                        of 68 Oriole and that she could move in there on its expiry, the
                        plaintiff entered negotiations to sell her home at 27A Merryn Road. Due
                        to the continued occupancy of 68 Oriole after 14 January 2011, the
                        plaintiff had to abort the negotiations for sale of her home and the buyer
                        lost interest. The plaintiff is losing potential rental income of $12,000 a
                        month for 27A Merryn Road as she is not able to move into
                        68 Oriole until it is transferred to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Not surprisingly, the defendant takes a
                    completely different view of the respective parties’ rights in relation to
                    68 Oriole. He asserts that until grant of probate has been issued and
                    distribution effected, the plaintiff is not entitled to receive the sum of
                    $141,261.06. Further any delay has been caused by the plaintiff’s own
                    actions. He also denies the plaintiff’s allegations of fact. The
                    plaintiff’s allegations of loss are purely speculative. He says the court
                    records will show that the defendant was prepared to allow the plaintiff to
                    reserve whatever rights of action she claimed to have against the defendant in a
                    bid to allow the grant to be issued without delay but the plaintiff did not
                    accept this proposal. The plaintiff is therefore the author of her own
                    misfortune.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Before I discuss the merits of the
                    plaintiff’s allegations, it is necessary to discuss the law on the
                    consequences of a specific devise or bequest. The gift of 68 Oriole to the
                    plaintiff is a specific devise. The first consequence of the gift being
                    classified as specific devise is that the rents accruing on the property from
                    the date of Mdm Ho’s death are part of the gift (see <em>Theobald on Wills</em> (17th Ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2010) at
                    para 38-001). However, on her death, 68 Oriole, like all
                    Mdm Ho’s other property, vested in the defendant as the named
                    executor (see s 35(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994
                    Rev Ed). It did not vest in the plaintiff although in equity the property was in
                    the plaintiff (see <em>Snell’s Equity</em> (32nd Ed,
                    London 2010) at para 33-003). The defendant therefore had the right to
                    collect the rent and pay the expenses of 68 Oriole out of the rent. The
                    second consequence of a gift being a specific devise (and of a property that is
                    free of mortgage) is that the gift (including the rents accruing after death)
                    cannot be used to meet the debts of the testatrix until the residuary estate and
                    any general legacies have been exhausted. However, although it is practically
                    the last class of assets to be used to pay the deceased’s death, it is
                    still available for that purpose and therefore in practical terms the
                    administration of the Estate will usually be quite far advanced before it is
                    clear whether the property contained in a specific devise is needed to pay
                    debts. As 68 Oriole is vested in the defendant, the plaintiff is not
                    entitled to possession of the property without the consent of the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Having regard to the law as stated above, my
                    conclusions on the plaintiff’s complaints as set out in [111] above are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant was entitled to
                        negotiate renewal of the tenancy of 68 Oriole with the tenant although
                        he was aware that the plaintiff wanted to live there. The defendant was also
                        entitled to take the position that until it was clear what liabilities of
                        the Estate were, he should continue to obtain income so as to meet such
                        liabilities if necessary. However, the defendant should have explained this
                        clearly to the plaintiff instead of keeping quiet and leaving her to find
                        out about the negotiations through her own efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant was not obliged to pay
                        over the rental collected after Mdm Ho’s death to the plaintiff
                        on her demand. He will only be obliged to pay that over to her when the
                        administration of the Estate is completed and at that stage he would have to
                        give her a proper accounting of the collection and expenditure of rental in
                        respect of 68 Oriole. There was nothing wrong with the tenant being
                        instructed to pay rental into the Interim Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff’s claim for loss
                        of use of 68 Oriole is not sustainable. When Mdm Ho died, the
                        property was subject to an existing tenancy which would not expire until 14
                        January 2011. Even if the defendant had applied for probate within six
                        months after Mdm Ho’s death, the earliest the premises would have
                        been vacant was 15 January 2011. There is no evidence that the
                        administration of the Estate would have been completed by then, especially
                        bearing in mind the Taiwanese action and S 820 started by Ms Ong.
                        The plaintiff has not been able to prove that it would have been reasonable
                        and practicable for the defendant to transfer the title and possession of
                        68 Oriole to her on 15 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff’s complaint of having to
                        spend her own money in maintaining 68 Oriole arises from her opposition
                        to the tenancy being renewed and from her insistence that the property be
                        handed over to her. This is not a complaint that can be upheld. Secondly,
                        the delay in administration of the Estate since 15 January 2011 has been
                        caused in large part by the existence of this litigation and therefore the
                        delay has been unavoidable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff’s negotiations to sell her home at
                        27A Merryn Road were undertaken of her own volition and without any
                        representation on the part of the defendant that he would not renew the
                        tenancy and that he would allow her to move in. All that the defendant told
                        her was that he would consider not renewing it but that depended on whether
                        the tenant had a right to ask for an extension. It would have been better
                        had the defendant told the plaintiff straight out that he was not going to
                        give her possession of the premises until the Estate was settled but he
                        cannot be held responsible for her intemperate actions in trying to sell or
                        rent out her home. The plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is
                        liable to pay her damages for loss of opportunity to sell 27A Merryn
                        Road is unsustainable in law and in fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The plaintiff acted most intemperately in
                    respect of 68 Oriole. She took the view that it belonged to her and that it
                    was for her to decide whether the tenant should stay or not. She harassed the
                    tenant twice by making unsolicited visits to the premises and informing the
                    tenant that she was the owner and did not intend to allow renewal of the lease.
                    After the tenant moved out, she also trespassed on to the property by entering
                    and changing the locks. The defendant could have made his position clear; his
                    fault was in refusing to engage directly with the plaintiff as he did not want
                    to be confrontational. This is somewhat understandable as the plaintiff would
                    not have taken any decision lying down but would have harassed the defendant to
                    accept her point of view. However, sometimes it is best to be blunt and deal
                    with the fall out immediately. The plaintiff’s fault, however, was greater
                    in that she completely disregarded the defendant’s rights and duties as
                    executor and, without any basis, took the view that because 68 Oriole was
                    bequeathed to her, she was entitled to full ownership rights immediately and
                    acted accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The plaintiff did argue that because the
                    defendant subsequently gave her possession of 68 Oriole in return for an
                    indemnity, there had been an “assent” which she described as an
                    act by a personal representing vesting the property in the person beneficially
                    entitled. The plaintiff is mistaken. Handing over possession in return for an
                    indemnity is simply a practical way of dealing with the property pending full
                    administration, bearing in mind the plaintiff’s determination to enjoy her
                    gift. It is not an “assent” in the technical sense of that term
                    and has not resulted in 68 Oriole being vested in the plaintiff. In any
                    event, the defendant only agreed to hand possession to the plaintiff sometime
                    after the tenancy had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I have dealt above with the allegations that
                    the plaintiff made in the statement of claim in relation to 68 Oriole. She
                    made some other points in her submissions which I should deal
                with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The plaintiff asserted that the defendant
                    had not acted with an even hand in that he had made a claim for rental for
                    68 Oriole while he himself was not paying rent for staying in
                    5 Harlyn. In October and November 2011, after the plaintiff took possession
                    of 68 Oriole, the defendant wrote several letters to her urging her to rent
                    out the premises for the benefit of the Estate. Thereafter, his counterclaim was
                    amended to include a counterclaim against her for taking possession of
                    68 Oriole without accounting for rent which he put at $16,000 a month based
                    on the plaintiff’s earlier estimation of an appropriate rental. The
                    plaintiff complained that while the defendant had made this claim, both he and
                    Dr Chiang took the position that the defendant was entitled to occupy
                    5 Harlyn without paying rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The plaintiff noted that the
                    defendant’s position in court was that 5 Harlyn had been
                    Mdm Ho’s matrimonial home and had never been rented out. As the
                    family home, it was in a different position from 68 Oriole which had been
                    used as an investment property for the generation of income. The plaintiff
                    did not accept this distinction. In her submissions, however, the plaintiff
                    asserted that in view of the defendant’s admission in court that the other
                    assets of the Estate were sufficient to settle its debts, neither 68 Oriole
                    nor 5 Harlyn needed to be rented out. She accepted that the defendant as
                    the specific devisee of 5 Harlyn was entitled to live there and need not
                    rent out that property. She asserted that in the same way that the defendant
                    could live in 5 Harlyn, she could occupy 68 Oriole and that since the
                    defendant was not paying rent to the Estate for his occupation of 5 Harlyn
                    he should not expect the plaintiff to pay rent to the Estate for 68 Oriole.
                    She submitted that the defendant had not acted with an even hand in making a
                    claim against the plaintiff for rent when he himself did not pay rent in similar
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In this respect, the plaintiff has a point.
                    While at the time the hearing of this action started there were possible claims
                    against the Estate, there was no evidence from the defendant that the residuary
                    assets of the Estate were insufficient to pay its debts even if these claims
                    were proved. It should be noted that when subsequently S 820 was settled,
                    there was no order for any payment to be made by the Estate to the Chiang
                    Estate. In court, the defendant admitted that in s 820 there was no claim
                    made by the Chiang Estate against the Estate. Similarly, no evidence was put
                    before me of any claimed or proven liability of the Estate to the Taiwanese
                    action. If the Estate is solvent, then the gifts to the plaintiff and the
                    defendant and any profits arising from them cannot be used to pay the debts of
                    the Estate. These would have to be settled out of the residuary
                estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The defendant explained that as executor he
                    considered that there may be, at the end of the administration, expenses that
                    would have to be settled by the beneficiaries. The defendant may have been
                    taking a very conservative view of the situation in assessing that the
                    beneficiaries might be liable to contribute to debts from the gifts made to
                    them. He was entitled to do this. He was also entitled to point out to the
                    plaintiff that if the residuary estate was insufficient, recourse would have to
                    be made to the specific gifts and the profits from them. If that happened, the
                    plaintiff might have to reimburse the Estate with the money that could have been
                    earned had she rented out 68 Oriole. In his letter of 20 September 2011 to
                    the plaintiff, the defendant said that he wished to highlight to “all
                    stakeholders that every member has to make an effort to increase the value of
                    the estate while grant of probate is still been [<em>sic</em>] worked out”. If that was the defendant’s view,
                    he should have also arranged for 5 Harlyn to be rented out. The fact that
                    5 Harlyn was the matrimonial home was irrelevant once Mdm Ho died. It
                    then became an asset of the Estate on the same basis that 68 Oriole was.
                    Both properties could be used to increase the value of the Estate if it was
                    feared that there would not be enough in the residuary estate to meet the
                    liabilities of the Estate. The defendant’s reason for not renting out
                    5 Harlyn was only a historical one; that historical reason could not apply
                    in the new circumstances. The defendant should have behaved as he wanted the
                    plaintiff wanted to behave. He applied a different standard to the property
                    given to the plaintiff than he did to the property given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Family companies run by the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In para 15 of the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff alleged that two family companies run by the defendant were doing
                    badly: StanChem had an accumulated loss of over RM21m over ten years and SCC,
                    from a profit of over $5m in 2009 had suffered a loss of $671,509 in 2010. The
                    plaintiff, however, did not expand on these allegations in her final submissions
                    and therefore I need say no more about them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suzhou land</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The allegation in para 16 of the statement
                    of claim is that the defendant had stated that he had no information on a piece
                    of land in Suzhou, China (“the Suzhou land”), although in fact
                    Mdm Ho had 50% share in this parcel and Mr Chiang had 1% share in the
                    same. Contrary to the defendant’s assertions, there were documents
                    relating to the Suzhou land in a CISCO safe deposit box (“CISCO
                    box”) in Bukit Merah. The keys to the CISCO box are held by the defendant
                    and Dr Chiang, and the defendant had refused to hand the keys to the
                    plaintiff. He had failed to respond to the plaintiff’s request to see
                    these documents which the plaintiff believed to be the title deeds to this
                    valuable piece of Chinese real estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In her submissions, the plaintiff
                    acknowledged that all items found in Mdm Ho’s room on the date of her
                    death were subsequently placed in the CISCO box in the presence of all the
                    beneficiaries. There were only two keys for the CISCO box and it was decided, by
                    a toss of a coin, that one key would be kept by the defendant and the other by
                    Dr Chiang. The plaintiff subsequently wrote many letters to ask for an
                    audit of the items in the CISCO box. She was particularly interested in item 14
                    which she said were the title deeds of the Suzhou land. In October 2011, the
                    defendant accompanied by a lawyer who represented the Chiang Estate made copies
                    of item 14. The defendant had paid several visits to the CISCO box on his own
                    and the plaintiff did not know if any items had been removed from the CISCO box.
                    The plaintiff’s complaint therefore was that she had never been given
                    access to the CISCO box despite her requests and that the defendant was
                    concealing documents which showed the interest of the Estate in the valuable
                    Suzhou land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The defendant responded that the document
                    alleged to be the title deeds was in fact not a title deed but related to the
                    Chiang ancestral home in China occupied by Mr Chiang’s brother and
                    family. Photographs with the description of the items in the CISCO box were
                    signed by the plaintiff and she was therefore fully aware that there were no
                    title deeds in the CISCO box. He produced a copy of the inventory list which the
                    plaintiff had signed together with photographs of the items which had been put
                    in the CISCO box.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    At the trial, the defendant testified that
                    the Suzhou land had been owned by a Chinese company in which his father had a
                    small share. His  evidence was that this property was acquired or
                    repossessed by the Government of China and that Mdm Ho herself had
                    travelled to China several times to either get the land back or get some
                    compensation for it but had been unsuccessful in her attempts. She had gone to
                    China with Dr Chiang. He also testified that the documents in the CISCO box
                    had nothing to do with the Suzhou land. The documents relating to the Suzhou
                    land were in a file which the plaintiff had “stolen” from
                    5 Harlyn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The plaintiff stated in court that the file
                    that she had taken from 5 Harlyn had subsequently been returned to Aequitas
                    and that the documents found in it had been copied and put in her Bundle A2
                    between pages 446 and 478. The plaintiff actually said, referring to page 446 of
                    that bundle, “This is the one that I stole” and she had returned
                    it to Aequitas but had the rest of the file.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Looking at the Agreed Bundle of Documents,
                    Bundle A2, I see that the documents between pages 446 and 500 are in the Chinese
                    language. There are documents between pages 501 and 522 which are in English and
                    are apparently translations of the Chinese documents but they are not certified
                    by any official translator. Taking the translations at face value, some of them
                    appear to be in respect of pieces of land but it is really not clear what
                    premises these are. One has an area of 776.8 square metres, another has an area
                    of 768.23 square metres and the third has an area of 479.68 square metres. I
                    have no idea whether these are parts of the same piece of land or three separate
                    pieces. There is no evidence that either Mr Chiang or Mdm Ho owned
                    these properties directly or through any company which they controlled. The
                    plaintiff has failed to substantiate her allegations whilst putting herself in a
                    bad light in that she admitted taking the file of documents from 5 Harlyn,
                    something she had no right to do. It should be noted that in her closing
                    submissions the plaintiff said that she had taken files from 5 Harlyn in
                    order to check the signature of Mr Chiang against that on a promissory note
                    which had been produced by Ms Wen. Even assuming that that was the
                    plaintiff’s sole motivation in taking the files, she had no right to
                    remove anything from 5 Harlyn, <em>a fortiori</em> to
                    do so for the purpose of meddling in the Chiang Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In court, when the plaintiff was confronted
                    with the fact that Aequitas had inspected the contents of the CISCO box and had
                    not found the title deeds that the plaintiff had referred to and that the
                    photographs of the items placed in the CISCO box did not show any title deeds,
                    she admitted that she had no direct evidence of the existence of such a
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Further, the plaintiff has no right to
                    inspect the contents of the CISCO box. She has a copy of the inventory of the
                    items in the CISCO box and even if the defendant has taken items out of the
                    CISCO box since that inventory was made, that should not cause the plaintiff any
                    concern because he will have to account for all these items at the end of the
                    day. All in all, the plaintiff has not made out any misconduct on the part of
                    the defendant in relation to the Suzhou land or the CISCO box. The plaintiff is
                    not entitled to a key to the CISCO box either. She admitted that there were only
                    two keys and the siblings had agreed to possession being decided by a toss of
                    the coin. The plaintiff lost the toss and cannot complain now. I should state,
                    however, that the defendant should have kept both keys himself as the appointed
                    executor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s actions in relation to the Chiang
                Estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In para 17 of the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff alleged that the defendant had acted as “<em>executor de son tort</em>” in relation to the Chiang Estate
                    although Ms Ong had been appointed executor of that estate. The particulars
                    of this allegation were that the defendant had represented to the tenant of
                    17C Dublin (the property belonging to the Chiang Estate) that he was in
                    charge of this property and that he had banked rental from the property into his
                    personal account. Further, on 20 February 2010, he had effected a renewal of the
                    lease of 17C Dublin. The defendant denied these allegations in his defence,
                    except for the fact that he had managed 17C Dublin for 20 years on behalf
                    of the family. The plaintiff did not deal with this allegation in her closing
                    submissions and I therefore presume that she is not pursuing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dr Chiang’s conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In para 18 of the statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff pleads that in December 2010 she had invited the other beneficiary,
                    Dr Chiang, to co-administer the Estate or renounce her rights to
                    co-administration. However, unknown to the plaintiff at that time,
                    Dr Chiang had been charged “for tax evasion” and was
                    subsequently found guilty and sentenced to six months’ jail.
                    Dr Chiang did not respond to this invitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Dr Chiang’s conviction is not
                    relevant to the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. The defendant had
                    nothing to do with the conduct of Dr Chiang which led to her conviction.
                    The only reason for this pleading would appear to be to establish that
                    Dr Chiang was not a suitable co-administratrix. In fact, in the first
                    version of her statement of claim, the plaintiff had asked for an order that
                    Dr Chiang would not be allowed to co-administer the Estate on this basis.
                    Although the plaintiff deleted the request for this order when she amended the
                    statement of claim, she did not similarly delete para 18. It should be noted
                    that in court Dr Chiang confirmed that she had no desire to administer or
                    co-administer the Estate and was content to leave this task to the defendant.
                    Accordingly, this paragraph of the statement of claim does not have to be
                    considered in relation to the plaintiff’s allegations against the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Schedule of Assets of the Estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In late 2009, the defendant sent the
                    plaintiff and Dr Chiang a draft Schedule of Assets in respect of the
                    Estate. Paragraph 20 of the statement of claim complained that although the
                    plaintiff had told the defendant in April 2010 that this draft Schedule of
                    Assets omitted certain assets, the defendant had not thereafter sent her a
                    complete and amended Schedule of Assets. The draft Schedule of Assets had not
                    included the Suzhou land, the POSB joint accounts which the defendant had with
                    Mdm Ho, a UOB Account, substantial sums of money in a bank in Hong Kong and
                    the items in the CISCO box.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The plaintiff repeated these allegations in
                    her submissions. Further, she noted there that when the defendant applied for
                    grant of probate he did not file the requisite Schedule of Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The defendant acknowledged that he had
                    failed to file a Schedule of Assets with his application for the grant. However,
                    he submitted that this failure was at best a procedural irregularity under
                    P 309 and was not directly relevant to this action. He said he would take
                    steps to address this irregularity as soon as possible. In the defendant’s
                    reply closing submissions dated 17 July 2014, it was stated that the defendant
                    was now at liberty to include all definitely known assets of the Estate in the
                    Schedule of Assets and would do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    It would therefore appear that up to July
                    2014 the defendant had not filed the Schedule of Assets. His submission was that
                    his failure to do so did not evidence his lack of ability to carry out his
                    duties as the executor of the Estate. In court, his lawyer explained that after
                    he had filed for probate, the matter had gone into litigation. That is correct.
                    However, given that up to last year, five years had passed since
                    Mdm Ho’s death and the defendant was actively dealing with the Estate
                    from her death, he should have been in a position to at least produce a revised
                    Schedule of Assets including all the assets of the Estate that he had discovered
                    by the time of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The defendant should have filed a Schedule
                    of Assets when he applied for probate. Whilst it may be only an irregularity
                    that he did not do so then, it is not satisfactory that more than five
                    years after Mdm Ho’s death this has not been
                accomplished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other grounds raised by the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The plaintiff made a number of allegations
                    about the defendant’s conduct which were not contained in the statement of
                    claim. Most of them must be disregarded. However there is one allegation which
                    is closely connected to the plaintiff’s pleaded concerns about the Interim
                    Account that I think must be explored. This is the plaintiff’s allegation
                    that the defendant used money in the Interim Account to pay for expenses or
                    items that had nothing to do with the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The plaintiff submitted that the defendant
                    had misused the Estate’s funds to pay for his personal expenses and those
                    of Dr Chiang as well as to pay for the expenses unrelated to the
                    administration of the Estate. She submitted that a review of the Estate’s
                    expenses, as shown by the bank statements she had obtained to court orders and
                    the defendant’s answers to Interrogatories and further and better
                    particulars requested, revealed that Estate funds had been wrongly used to pay
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_a"></a>(a)     Central Provident Fund
                        (“CPF”) levies on two maids used by the defendant at two
                        locations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_b"></a>(b)     Aequitas’ fees paid in respect of administration of the Chiang Estate
                        for the defendant and Dr Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chien Yeh Law Offices’ fees in relation to the
                        release of Ms Wen from the mortgage of the Taiwan property bequeathed
                        to Ms Wen by Mr Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_d"></a>(d)     Costs of repairs and property taxes paid in respect of
                        properties belonging to the Chiang Estate, including 33 Merryn and
                        17C Dublin.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_141-p2_e"></a>(e)     The reimbursement of $600,000 to the Chiang
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I will deal with these in
                        turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CPF levies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The plaintiff noted that in his opening
                    statement the defendant had stated that he had reimbursed the Estate in respect
                    of payments it had made for the defendant’s maids’ levies. On
                    cross-examination, however, the defendant admitted that he had not yet
                    reimbursed the Estate for his maids’ levies which had been charged to the
                    Estate from 2009 to 2012. It was only after this admission that, on 28 November
                    2013, the defendant deposited $9,381 into the Interim Account as refund of the
                    levies. I should point out here that levies were paid for two maids who had
                    looked after Mr Chiang and Mdm Ho prior to their deaths. However, the
                    maids continued to be employed by the defendant after August 2009 and it was the
                    levies paid from September 2009 onwards that the plaintiff was objecting
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In the defendant’s closing
                    submissions, he pointed to his evidence that the levies had been mistakenly
                    deducted from the Interim Account but that he had intended, and instructed his
                    accountants, to pay the levies back to that account. The defendant said it was
                    only after giving this evidence that he found out that his accountants had
                    failed to carry out his instructions and he therefore made the reimbursement on
                    28 November 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I am not very happy with his explanation.
                    The deduction of the levies from the Interim Account was effected by GIRO. GIRO
                    payments can only be made from a bank account when the holder of that account
                    signs the necessary GIRO authorisation form. Obviously, the defendant must have
                    put the GIRO arrangements in place. He should not have done so. It was one thing
                    for the defendant to use his parents’ funds to pay the maids’ levies
                    while his parents were alive and looking after them. Once his parents died, he
                    would have had to reconsider whether he needed to continue employing the maids
                    and, if so, whether the expenses could still come from the Estate. The defendant
                    did not put forward any reason why the Estate needed the maids’ services.
                    In the absence of such reason, if he wanted to continue their employment, he
                    would have to bear all the expenses himself. I consider that it was wrong for
                    the defendant to use the Interim Account for this purpose and it was also lax of
                    him, when the mistake was pointed out, not to ensure that the reimbursement was
                    made immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fees paid to Aequitas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    A total sum of $15,000 was paid on 29
                    January 2011 from the Interim Account to Aequitas in their capacity as
                    solicitors for the Chiang Estate. As noted in the defendant’s closing
                    submissions, the defendant had explained that Aequitas had written to each of
                    the defendant, Dr Chiang and the Estate, seeking a deposit of $5,000 from
                    each party in order to appoint lawyers in Taiwan to represent the Chiang Estate
                    and the beneficiaries of Mr Chiang against the claims made by Ms Wen
                    in the Taiwanese action. The defendant explained that if the Chiang Estate had
                    succeeded in its defence to Ms Wen’s claims, the property in Taiwan
                    would become part of the residuary assets of the Chiang Estate and, as such,
                    would flow to the Estate (Mdm Ho being the beneficiary of the residue of
                    the Chiang Estate) and would in turn pass to the beneficiaries of the Estate.
                    The defendant submitted that since the beneficiaries of the Chiang Estate were
                    in effect the same as the beneficiaries of the Estate, he took the initiative to
                    bear part of the expenses meant for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the
                    Chiang Estate from the Interim Account. Overall, it would be the beneficiaries
                    of the Estate who stood to gain. The defendant admitted that he had not paid the
                    plaintiff’s $5,000 deposit to Aequitas but said that sum had already been
                    reimbursed to her by Aequitas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The letter from Aequitas dated 11 November
                    2009 was produced in court. It states that Ms Ong should not be out of
                    pocket for expenses that would be incurred to carry out her role as executor and
                    trustee of the Chiang Estate (those costs would include the expenses of
                    defending the Taiwanese action). Accordingly, she proposed that the
                    beneficiaries of the Chiang Estate, namely, the defendant, Dr Chiang, the
                    plaintiff and the Estate as well as Ms Wen, should each contribute an
                    initial sum of $5,000 to Mdm Ong’s initial costs and expenses. This
                    amount would be reimbursed later from the assets of the Chiang Estate. It was in
                    respect of this request that the defendant used $15,000 from the Interim Account
                    to pay the shares of the Estate, Dr Chiang and himself. He did this in
                    February 2011, by which time the plaintiff had already paid her
                $5,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    I consider that the defendant was not
                    justified in using the Interim Account to pay the $5,000 requested from him and
                    Dr Chiang. Whilst the administration of the Chiang Estate would ultimately
                    benefit the Estate, like the plaintiff, he and Dr Chiang were direct
                    beneficiaries of Mr Chiang’s will and were not inheriting simply
                    because of their interests in the Estate. That was why each of them was asked
                    separately to contribute $5,000 and there was no reason why each of them could
                    not have paid that contribution. If the defendant wanted to use funds from the
                    Estate because the three children were the beneficiaries of the Estate, then he
                    should have done so on behalf of all of them and, since the plaintiff had
                    already paid her share, he could have reimbursed the $5,000 to her at the same
                    time as he paid Aequitas on behalf of himself and Dr Chiang. The defendant
                    did not act with an even hand in this instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment to Taiwanese lawyers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The plaintiff’s complaint is that the
                    defendant had used money from the Interim Account to pay Taiwanese lawyers to
                    defend himself and Dr Chiang in the Taiwanese action which related to a
                    property in Taiwan which Mr Chiang had given to Ms Wen while he was
                    alive. Apparently, there was a mortgage over the property in favour of
                    Mr Chiang, and Ms Wen was seeking the cancellation of that mortgage.
                    The plaintiff alleged that the Estate was not a party to the action and
                    therefore its funds were wrongly used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The defendant’s explanation in his
                    closing submissions was that he paid $3,234.65 from the Interim Account on
                    behalf of the Estate, Dr Chiang and himself to Chieh Yeh Law offices in
                    Taiwan to defend the Taiwanese action. The defendant explained that all three of
                    them (<em>ie</em>, including the Estate) and the plaintiff
                    had been named as parties in the Taiwanese action and therefore had to be
                    represented. He asserted that if Ms Wen had lost her claim, the Estate
                    would have benefited and as a direct result the three siblings would benefit as
                    well. Although the plaintiff’s legal costs in Taiwan had not been paid
                    from the Interim Account, the plaintiff also stood to benefit from the
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    There were a few documents in the bundles
                    which related to this payment and the Taiwanese action. They paint a slightly
                    different picture from that given by the defendant. It appears from the
                    defendant’s lawyers’ correspondence with the Taiwanese lawyer that
                    Ms Wen had sued all the children of Mr Chiang. Therefore, the
                    defendants to the Taiwanese action were the plaintiff here and her two siblings
                    as well as Ms Wen’s own son. The Estate was not a defendant to the
                    action. Further, a Power of Attorney was given by the defendant here and
                    Dr Chiang to the Taiwanese lawyers to act for them in connection with the
                    Taiwanese suit. This Power of Attorney was signed by the defendant here on
                    behalf of himself alone; he did not sign it on behalf of the Estate. This
                    conclusion is supported by the defendant’s instruction to his Singapore
                    lawyers to appoint the Taiwanese lawyers to represent himself and
                    Dr Chiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In the circumstances, as the Estate was not
                    a party to the Taiwanese action, the defendant should not have used Estate funds
                    to pay the Taiwanese lawyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Expenses in respect of properties belonging to the Chiang
                Estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The defendant paid $58,705.33 from the
                    Interim Account in order to settle bills relating to the repair of
                    33 Merryn and 17C Dublin, both of which properties belonged to the
                    Chiang Estate. His explanation was that there had been an urgent need to repair
                    these properties because the tenants had complained about their condition. The
                    defendant wanted to ensure that the properties remained profitably rented out
                    and, as the Chiang Estate had had no funds, he used the Interim Account to make
                    payment. He believed that the Estate would be reimbursed when the Chiang Estate
                    was settled and, further, that income accruing from these properties would
                    ultimately benefit the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    I accept the defendant’s explanation.
                    Technically speaking, these repairs were the responsibility of the Chiang
                    Estate. However, 17C Dublin was devised to Mdm Ho and therefore on
                    distribution of the Chiang Estate she would have received both the property and
                    its income (net of expenses). It was in the interest of the Estate, therefore,
                    to repair 17C Dublin and maintain its income and the defendant cannot be
                    faulted for advancing money from the Estate for this purpose. The situation with
                    regard to 33 Merryn was different in that it had been devised to
                    Ms Wen. The Estate therefore would not benefit from repairing it. However,
                    the defendant may have been under the mistaken impression that the Estate would
                    be entitled to the rental earned by 33 Merryn between the date of
                    Mr Chiang’s death and distribution of the Chiang Estate because it
                    had a quarter share in his residual estate. Being familiar with the
                    defendant’s attitude in this case and the stand taken by him in relation
                    to 68 Oriole, I am inclined to believe that he had such a mistaken
                    impression. I  therefore accept that the defendant acted in good faith
                    in making these payments and should not be criticised for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Payment of $600,000 to the Chiang Estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The defendant paid the Chiang Estate the sum
                    of $600,000 because he had transferred this money out of CCL’s Account
                    after his death and should not have done so. He therefore reimbursed it to the
                    Chiang Estate. The plaintiff’s complaint in her closing submissions was
                    that “only $600,000 withdrawn after father’s demise has been
                    returned to the [Chiang Estate]”. Whilst the plaintiff was not really
                    contesting the correctness of this payment, she made the point that he had not
                    reimbursed the Chiang Estate with the amounts withdrawn before
                    Mr Chiang’s death. Strictly speaking, that is a matter to be taken up
                    by Ms Ong with the defendant and for the Chiang Estate to consider whether
                    it should make such a claim since Mdm Ho and her three children are the
                    residuary beneficiaries of the Chiang Estate. Therefore, I need say no more
                    about it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decisions on the plaintiff’s claims for relief</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The plaintiff’s statement of claim
                    contains the whole list of reliefs that she has prayed for. I have enumerated
                    the main prayers in [19] above. In view of the findings that I have made in the
                    foregoing paragraphs, I can deal expeditiously with most of these. I will need,
                    however, to deal in a little more detail with some of them. Using the numbering
                    in the statement of claim, I hold as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <u>Prayer
                            1</u>: There will not be a declaration that the defendant has
                        acted in breach of fiduciary duty and administration of the Estate because
                        although the defendant did misapply some money belonging to the Estate, he
                        has reimbursed the Estate with all funds which he misapplied and, further,
                        when he did so he considered that he was justified because the money was
                        used for the purposes of the beneficiaries of the Estate and could be
                        accounted for subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <u>Prayer 2</u>: While it is
                        clear that the defendant must account for all money taken from Account 46-8
                        and deposited into the Interim Account, the defendant is well aware of his
                        duty in that respect and has been carrying it out and there is no need to
                        make a declaration to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>Prayer 3</u>: The defendant
                        has provided accounts of all money belonging to the Estate up to 31 May 2013
                        and such behaviour shows his recognition of his duty to provide accounts. As
                        long as the defendant continues to provide accounts at yearly intervals
                        until the finalisation of the Estate, there should be no  reason
                        to make any peremptory order against him in that respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <u>Prayers 4 and
                            5</u>: The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration that the
                        transfers from CCL’s Account into Account 46-8 were wrongful as she is
                        not a legal representative of the Chiang Estate. For the same reason, she
                        cannot ask for an order that the defendant do account for the money
                        transferred out of CCL’s Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_e"></a>(e)     
            <u>Prayer 6</u>: There
                        is no legal basis for any declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to
                        trace and has a beneficial interest in the transfers that were made from
                        CCL’s Account to Account 46-8.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_f"></a>(f)     
            <u>Prayer 7</u>: The
                        plaintiff’s prayer that the defendant be declared liable to account
                        for funds from the Estate used to make interest payments to UOB cannot
                        sustained as it was proper to use the Estate’s funds for this
                        purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_g"></a>(g)     
            <u>Prayer 8</u>: The plaintiff is not entitled
                        to hold the key to the CISCO box.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_h"></a>(h)     
            <u>Prayers 9 and 10</u>: These
                        are not complete prayers and need not be dealt with.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_i"></a>(i)     
            <u>Prayers 11 and
                            12</u>: I have found that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim
                        loss and damage from the defendant so prayer 11 cannot be granted and prayer
                        12 asking for interest is also inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The last three prayers in the statement of
                    claim ( prayers 13,14 and 15) deal with the plaintiff’s main aim: the
                    removal of the defendant as executor and her appointment as his replacement. The
                    plaintiff made many allegations against the defendant. Most of these were
                    unjustified. However, I have made some findings which may have an adverse effect
                    on my assessment of his ability to administer the Estate. These are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant intermingled money
                        from CCL’s Account with the money in Account 46-8
                        ([68]–[70]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant had been dilatory in applying for grant of probate
                        ([78]–[79]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendant applied a different standard to the issue of renting
                        out 68 Oriole than he did to the issue of renting out 5 Harlyn
                        ([120]–[122]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendant had not filed a Schedule of Assets as late as five
                        years from Mdm Ho’s death ([137]–[139]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_e"></a>(e)     The defendant had wrongfully used the
                        Interim Account to pay levies for his domestic maids after his
                        parents’ death ([143]–[144]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_f"></a>(f)     The defendant had wrongfully used the Interim
                        Account to pay Aequitas on behalf of Dr Chiang, the Estate and himself,
                        but not on behalf of the plaintiff ([145]–[147]);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_g"></a>(g)     The defendant
                        had wrongfully used the Interim Account to pay Dr Chiang’s and
                        his legal fees in the Taiwanese action since the Estate was not a party to
                        that action ([150]–[151]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The question is whether these matters taken
                    together warrant the passing over of the defendant. As I have pointed out, there
                    is some excuse for the defendant’s actions in relation to the moneys in
                    CCL’s Account and, although the plaintiff was dilatory in filing for grant
                    of probate, he did take charge of the Estate from the outset and did not neglect
                    it. However, his tendency to use moneys from the Estate for his personal
                    liabilities (maids and legal fees) and his unwillingness or inability to
                    distinguish between the use of money for the administration of the Estate and
                    his personal use may support a finding that it would be undesirable and unsafe
                    to entrust the administration of the Estate to him. Further, he showed a
                    disturbing tendency to treat the plaintiff differently from himself and
                    Dr Chiang. On the other hand, the defendant has accepted the criticism of
                    his use of the funds and returned them to the Estate. He has kept complete
                    accounts of the transactions involving the Interim Account and has supplied the
                    plaintiff with these. This is an important point as it means any misapplication
                    of funds can be immediately identified and remedied. Also, the defendant
                    accommodated the plaintiff’s request for possession of 68 Oriole. It
                    may be argued that with proper advice he would be able to administer the Estate
                    properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    It may be instructive at this point to
                    consider the decisions of the Malaysian and Singapore Courts of Appeal in a case
                    involving basically the same parties and the same estate which was fought in
                    both jurisdictions. The decision of the Malaysian Court of Appeal is set out in
                        <em>Damayanti Kantilal Doshi v Jigarlal Kantilal
                        Doshi</em> [1998] 4 MLJ 268 (“<em>Doshi
                        (Malaysia)</em>”). The executors appointed by the will in that
                    case appealed the decision of the Johor Bahru High Court to revoke the probate
                    granted to them. The Malaysian Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding
                    that four of the complaints constituted “sufficient cause” for
                    interference. The complaints related to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_a"></a>(a)     the executors’ failure to
                        extract the grant of probate seven years after the grant (“First
                        Complaint”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_b"></a>(b)     the executors’ failure to render accounts or periodic accounts
                        (“Second Complaint”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_c"></a>(c)     the executors’ failure to take steps to prevent
                        the dissipation of assets (“Third Complaint”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_158-p2_d"></a>(d)     the open and
                        active hostility between the executors and the respondents who were all
                        beneficiaries under the will (“Fourth
                    Complaint”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The Malaysian Court of Appeal did not find
                    any dishonesty on the part of the executors, though it was of the opinion that
                    their conduct was deliberate in respect of the First Complaint, and that they
                    ought to have done more as “responsible executrix and executor having the
                    welfare and interests of the beneficiaries” in respect of the Third
                    Complaint. It would be noted that the Second and Third Complaints are not
                    germane to the present case and that the period of delay here is very much
                    shorter than that encompassed by the First Complaint. What is of particular
                    relevance to me is the Malaysian Court of Appeal’s finding on the Fourth
                    Complaint. The relevant paragraphs are set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the facts adduced and the various suits filed in various courts by
                        the respective parties, it is undoubtedly clear that as between the
                        appellants in particular the second appellant and the first and second
                        respondents, there exists not just animosity or disagreement between them
                        but that their relationship can safely be said to be one of open and active
                        hostility. <em>That relationship is such that it would be
                            nigh impossible for the second appellant to fairly and impartially
                            discharge his duties towards the
                        respondents/beneficiaries</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This hostility has manifested itself in the endless litigations commenced
                        by both parties against each other and these actions have produced a number
                        of interlocutory orders that were sought and obtained in the form of
                        injunctions, discoveries and appointment of receivers. This [<em>sic</em>] in turn have led to allegations of
                        non-compliance with court orders which culminated in actions for contempt.
                        There has not been any denial that estate funds were being utilised to
                        finance the spate of cases which may not see the light at the end of the
                        tunnel. On the criminal side, the first respondent was initially accused of
                        the murder of the deceased. This murder charge was subsequently withdrawn
                        and substituted with a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. The
                        first respondent contends that the second and third appellants were
                        responsible for making false allegations against him, resulting in the
                        criminal proceedings. If this is not clear evidence of direct and open
                        hostility, we do not know what is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While it is true that friction or hostility between the
                        parties per se may not be a good reason for the removal of the appellants as
                        the executrix and the executor, <em>such hostility if
                            grounded in the manner in which the estate is being administered or not
                            being administered, is a matter that ought not to be
                            disregarded</em>. In this respect Lord Blackburn in <em>Letterstedt (Now Vicomtesse Montmort) v Broers &amp;
                            Anor</em> [1884] 9 AC 371 at p 389 said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is quite true that friction or hostility between trustees and the
                            immediate possessor of the trust estate is not of itself a reason for
                            the removal of the trustees. But where the hostility is grounded on the
                            mode in which the trust has been administered, where it has been caused
                            wholly or partially by substantial overcharges against the trust estate,
                            it is certainly not to be disregarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    When the parties in <em>Doshi
                        (Malaysia)</em> had a similar fight over administration of the
                    deceased’s estate in Singapore, the outcome was very different. The Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Jigarlal Kantilal Doshi v Damayanti Kantilal
                        Doshi (executrix of the estate of Kantilal Prabhulal Doshi,
                        deceased)</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 290 (“<em>Doshi
                        (Singapore)</em>”) had to consider what constituted
                    “sufficient cause” under s 32 of the Probate Act which states that
                    probate may be revoked or amended for “any sufficient cause”. The
                    Court of Appeal at [12] adopted the interpretation in a number of Malaysian
                    cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The [Probate Act] does not define what constitutes
                        ‘sufficient cause’. However, ‘sufficient cause’ has
                        been explained in the authorities to mean ‘undue and improper
                        administration of the estate in total disregard of the interests of the
                        beneficiaries’: <em>Fazil Rahman v Machiappa
                            Chettiar</em> [1963] MLJ 309 at 210, and <em>Re
                            Khoo Boo Gong, deceased</em> [1981] 2 MLJ 68 at 69; <em>Tan Khay Seng v Tan Kay Choon</em> [1990] 1 MLJ 51. There
                        must be <em>evidence of misconduct or fraud</em> on the
                        part of the executors or <em>immediate danger of
                            loss</em>, and the test is an objective one. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    In <em>Doshi
                        (Singapore)</em>, the Court of Appeal accepted the findings of the
                    Malaysian courts that the executors had not properly discharged their duties as
                    executors in respect of the assets of the estate in Malaysia, and that there was
                    sufficient cause for the revocation of the executor’s grant of probate in
                    Malaysia. However, the Court of Appeal stressed that the court’s exercise
                    of the power under s 13(2) of the Probate Act is a discretionary one. The Court
                    of Appeal then declined to exercise its jurisdiction to revoke the letters of
                    administration here on the ground that there was no suitable party to take over
                    the administration of the estate in Singapore. I am in a similar
                dilemma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    On an overall assessment of the situation,
                    despite the hostility between the plaintiff and the defendant, I have concluded
                    that I should not exercise my discretion under s 55 of the Probate Act to
                    pass over the defendant as the named executor. Apart from the matters I have
                    mentioned in [157] above which serve to explain or ameliorate the
                    defendant’s conduct to some extent, he is not a person of bad character.
                    He has made mistakes but he has recognised these and reimbursed the Estate. His
                    overall concern is to administer the Estate on behalf of his mother who reposed
                    trust in him for at least the last 30 years of her life. It is important that he
                    was the person who handled all Mdm Ho’s financial affairs for a
                    substantial period before her death. His situation is different from that of the
                    executor in <em>Hameed Nachia</em> in that although he
                    delayed in the formal application for probate, he did take up the reins of the
                    Estate from the very beginning. In doing so, he simply continued to do what he
                    had been doing while his mother was alive. Unlike the named executor in
                        <em>Hameed Nachia</em>, the defendant also recognises
                    the claims of the plaintiff as beneficiary. The cases are clear that the
                    selection of an executor by a testatrix is entitled to be given great
                    weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I am also influenced by the fact that there
                    is no one else who has applied for probate who is suitable to administer the
                    Estate. Dr Chiang is not interested and, for the reasons that I give below,
                    I find it would not be in the interests of the Estate to grant its
                    administration to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s suitability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The defendant submitted that the plaintiff
                    is not suitable to act as the administrator of the Estate because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_a"></a>(a)     she is an extremely vindictive and
                        difficult person who will stop at nothing to achieve her
                    ends;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_b"></a>(b)     she had
                        extended her relentless attacks on CPPL by informing IRAS of irregularities
                        in the company’s affairs when there were none and this resulted in the
                        books and documents of CPPL being seized by IRAS;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_c"></a>(c)     she filed a police report against the
                        defendant for “threatening her with law suits” and another one
                        for “criminal breach of trust” in relation to the use of funds
                        from CCL’s Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_d"></a>(d)     on the expiry of the lease of 68 Oriole, the
                        plaintiff “drove outside 68 Oriole Crescent, stalking the
                        property” and then filed a police report that there was a
                        “stranger” living in the premises instead of ascertaining from
                        the defendant whether the tenant had vacated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_e"></a>(e)     the plaintiff lodged a police report against
                        Dr Chiang three days after Mdm Ho’s death because she wished
                        to pursue “the matter that my sister had accused me of causing our
                        mother’s death”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_f"></a>(f)     the plaintiff sent two letters of complaint to the
                        Singapore Medical Council against Dr Chiang complaining that
                        Dr Chiang had wrongfully prescribed Plavix for her mother. I should
                        note here that on 8 April 2010 the Singapore Medical Council informed the
                        plaintiff that the Complaints Committee had enquired into her complaint. It
                        had concluded that there was no evidence of professional misconduct on the
                        part of Dr Chiang and decided to dismiss the complaint;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_g"></a>(g)     the plaintiff
                        had no qualms about stealing files belonging to Mr Chiang from
                        5 Harlyn without informing the defendant or Ms Ong and in calling
                        in a locksmith to break the padlocks of the gate and change the locks of the
                        front door to 68 Oriole without informing the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The defendant also submitted that if the
                    plaintiff should become the executor, there was a real risk that the
                    relationship between her and Dr Chiang and the defendant would worsen even
                    further. It was also likely that there would be further litigation in the event
                    of the plaintiff being appointed. This would not be in the interests of the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    In response, the plaintiff submitted that
                    she had acted reasonably in requesting the Singapore Medical Council to
                    investigate her report against Dr Chiang regarding the prescription of
                    Plavix for Mdm Ho in view of accusations that Dr Chiang had made
                    against the plaintiff in relation to Mdm Ho’s death and of the
                    findings of the autopsy and toxicology reports. I note here that it is
                    somewhat odd to justify a serious complaint like the one made by the plaintiff
                    on the basis that Dr Chiang had made unwarranted accusations against the
                    plaintiff. The plaintiff is now a mature woman and should not take tit-for-tat
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The plaintiff said that she had taken
                    Mr Chiang’s files from 5 Harlyn for a purpose and had
                    subsequently returned all but one file. Further, the plaintiff had made efforts
                    at reconciliation with her siblings. She had put forward a draft set of terms of
                    settlement but unfortunately no settlement had resulted. She averred that she
                    had shown no animosity or unfairness or made groundless attacks on her siblings.
                    It was the defendant and Dr Chiang who were not fair and hostile to her.
                    The litigation here was started because the defendant had not properly
                    administered the Estate and not out of vindictiveness. The plaintiff,
                    unfortunately, seems to me to have no insight into her own motives and no
                    appreciation of how her actions appear to third parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Having considered all the evidence, I have
                    concluded that it would not be in the interest of the due administration of the
                    Estate to appoint the plaintiff as administrator. The relationship between her
                    and her siblings is so bad that the chances of further litigation are extremely
                    high: they would be suspicious of every action she takes and would take every
                    opportunity to criticise her as she herself has done in respect of the
                    administration by the defendant. The plaintiff also, from what I have observed,
                    is not an objective person. Once she has an idea in her head, she pursues the
                    same until the bitter end, disregarding any evidence or argument that might cast
                    doubt on the soundness of that idea. The plaintiff is also willing to deny
                    knowledge of matters she would clearly have been aware of for years and even to
                    deny that she is the author of letters concerning the defendant and the estate
                    when the information in such letters could not have been possessed by a third
                    party. The plaintiff has a tendency to put her own interests first as shown by
                    her behaviour in relation to 68 Oriole. She is also rather self-righteous.
                    All that does not bode well for the efficient and speedy and objective
                    administration of the Estate if she were to be appointed
                administrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The defendant’s counterclaim against
                    the plaintiff is in three parts. The first part is a claim for damages on
                    the basis that the plaintiff brought a frivolous claim against him. The second
                    part is the claim that she is liable to him for loss of rental in respect of
                    68 Oriole. The third part is a claim for an order prohibiting the plaintiff
                    from interfering in any way with the issue of grant of probate for the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    I will deal with the second part first. I
                    have held that any rental from 68 Oriole which accrued after
                    Mdm Ho’s death belongs to the plaintiff subject to deductions for
                    expenses incurred in maintaining 68 Oriole. The defendant as executor of
                    the Estate would have no claim on the rental unless the Estate is insolvent and
                    the rental is needed to pay its debts. There is, as stated earlier, no evidence
                    that the Estate is in this position. The defendant’s claim is premature.
                    When the Estate is being wound up, if it then appears that recourse has to be
                    had to the income from the specific devises in order to pay the debts of the
                    Estate, he will be able to make a claim against the plaintiff for her share of
                    the same. At that stage, of course, he and Dr Chiang, as the other specific
                    devisees, would have to make their contributions to the Estate’s debts as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I turn now to the first part of the
                    counterclaim. The basis of this counterclaim is that the plaintiff abused the
                    process of the court because she brought an action based on false allegations.
                    The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had embarked on this litigation
                    without basis. There were days of speculative oral evidence from the plaintiff
                    and her alleged expert and the litigation became more prolix with extended and
                    unnecessary cross-examination of the defendant. The conduct of the trial showed
                    no <em>bona fide</em> claim by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    As can be seen from my analysis in the
                    foregoing portions of this judgment, while many of the plaintiff’s
                    complaints were unjustified, she did have some grounds for challenging the
                    defendant’s suitability to be the executor. The most significant of these
                    was the defendant’s delay in filing for probate when the Estate required
                    firm management from the beginning. Had  the defendant responded to
                    the plaintiff’s various queries in 2010 by filing immediately for probate,
                    this action would not have been started.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Further, as I have pointed out above, the
                    defendant did act incorrectly in relation to certain expenditure that he had
                    made from the Interim Account. I  have decided on balance that it
                    would not be correct to pass over the defendant as executor. However, the
                    plaintiff’s claim was not totally frivolous and I do not think it would be
                    correct to award the defendant damages. The defendant asserted that if she had
                    not brought the action he would have, upon extracting the grant of probate, paid
                    off the loan secured by 70 Oriole and saved interest. This is not a very
                    convincing argument. If the defendant was so concerned about the interest, he
                    would have applied immediately for a grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    As regards the third part of the
                    counterclaim, in view of my other findings, it would be appropriate to order the
                    plaintiff to refrain from interfering with the issue of grant of probate for the
                    Estate and to remove the caveats that she has lodged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The defendant submitted that if the
                    plaintiff’s claims were dismissed, she should be held liable for costs on
                    an indemnity basis. His justification was that he should not be required to use
                    the Estate’s funds to cover the costs that could not be recovered on the
                    standard basis. If he had to do so, it would mean that the residuary assets to
                    be distributed to the defendant and Dr Chiang would be adversely
                    affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In response, the plaintiff cited the
                    following passage from <em>Raman on Probate</em> at
                    p 140:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>E.   </b>
<b>Costs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ordinarily, costs should follow the event. However, in probate actions,
                        there is a permutation to this rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Costs in probate actions are based strictly on the
                        jurisdiction or reasonableness of bringing such actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Executors and administrators, in the absence of gross misconduct, are
                            entitled to their full costs of the suit as between solicitor and client
                            out of the estate, properly incurred by them. The general principle is
                            that the estate must bear the expenses incidental to the proper
                            performance of the duties of the person representatives as personal
                            representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even where the defendant has been unsuccessful in opposing probate, costs
                        may be ordered to be paid out to him from the estate. In a case where the
                        defendants opposed the granting of probate alleging unsoundness of mind of
                        the testator at the time he made his will, costs were ordered to be paid out
                        to them from the estate as the court held that there was a reasonable case
                        for inquiry. It is only in cases where the party has been unreasonable that
                        he will be ordered to pay costs himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Having considered all the circumstances,
                    there is no doubt that many of the plaintiff’s complaints were
                    unjustified. The plaintiff also prolonged the proceedings unnecessarily in the
                    way that she conducted cross-examination of the defendant and by calling her
                    husband and daughter as witnesses when they had little, if anything, to
                    contribute to the proceedings. However, the defendant also behaved wrongly and
                    his attitude towards the plaintiff did not help very much. I note that if any
                    costs come out of the residue of the Estate, Dr Chiang would be adversely
                    affected. She took no part in the proceedings, except to testify, and should not
                    be penalised. Overall, I think the fairest approach would be to order that the
                    defendant’s costs of this action be taxed on a solicitor and client basis
                    and that the plaintiff bear 75% of the costs as taxed with the defendant bearing
                    the remaining 25%. The costs should not be recovered from the
                Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    For the reasons given above, the claim is
                    dismissed. Except that the plaintiff is ordered to refrain from interfering in
                    any way with the issue of grant of probate to the defendant in respect of the
                    Estate and to forthwith remove all caveats in respect of the Estate, the
                    counterclaim is dismissed. The plaintiff shall pay to the defendant 75% of the
                    costs of defending the action (including the costs of prosecuting the
                    counterclaim as it is inextricably tied up with the claim) as taxed on the
                    solicitor and client basis. The remaining 25% shall be borne by the defendant
                    who shall not be entitled to recover the same from the Estate.</p>
