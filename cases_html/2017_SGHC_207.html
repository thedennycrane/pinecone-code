At the material time, the Defendant was primarily involved in the business of consumer electronics, being the main distributor and licensee of the AKIRA brand of electronic products worldwide. It was founded by a couple, Mr Sng Sze Hiang and Ms Tong Jia Pi Julia (collectively, “the Sngs”). While its business appeared to do well, it incurred losses from foreign exchange derivatives, and had large loans, entailing personal guarantees from the majority shareholders of the company, the Sngs. Following the global financial crisis in 2008, the company’s position worsened, as credit dried up while it had outstanding claims from creditors amounting to some $607.03m.

In a situation of insolvency, the assets are essentially for the benefit of the creditors. The materiality of the state of solvency was recognised in <span class="font-italic">Re Econ</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span> because the primacy of the contractual arrangement was impliedly acknowledged in a solvent situation. Here however, a “diametrically different context” operates because the Defendant was never placed under liquidation and had been successfully restructured. Independent financial advisors such as the Plaintiff work to create value for companies in financial trouble. The Defendant had also obtained benefits from the Plaintiff’s efforts.

Independent financial advisors should be distinguished from court-appointed insolvency practitioners such as liquidators or receivers. A VAF arrangement (or other types of success fees) provides incentives for independent financial advisors. Such an incentive benefits the company in motivating financial advisors to strive for successful outcomes. Risk is shared between the company and the financial advisors. The treatment accorded by the court in this case will have an impact on Singapore’s aspirations as an international centre for debt restructuring. Singapore needs to attract top insolvency specialists and independent financial advisors. If such fee arrangements are readily rewritten, the “wrong signal” would be sent, disincentivising these professionals.

To discard the formula would leave the court with no principled basis to carry out the assessment. The share price and the benchmarks exhibited give the court a proper basis to conclude that the Defendant benefited from the Plaintiff’s services.

The Plaintiff did not play any role in obtaining loans, facilities or other investment for the Big Box Project. Even if credit can be claimed in respect of the latter, these would be work done in discharge of its responsibilities as an independent financial adviser to the Defendant, for which it has already been duly paid. The successful management of the Scheme put in place was dependent on the Defendant’s management and staff. The Defendant’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the Scheme depended on it obtaining the necessary funding required for the Big Box Project. Such funding was obtained by the Defendant’s own efforts and not the Plaintiff’s. The Plaintiff cannot claim that it has contributed value solely on the basis that certain events (such as new investments and loans) would not have materialised if not for the Scheme that saved the Defendant from being wound up. The Plaintiff’s claim of improving the Defendant’s balance sheet and restoring investor confidence, leading to the securing of credit facilities, particularly through the Reverse Dutch Action, is misconceived. The Defendant had negative equity as at 31 March 2011. That position continued to the end of the 2013 financial year. The improved equity position of the Defendant thereafter was largely due to the revaluation of property, plant and equipment rather than any improved financial performance of the Defendant. Furthermore, the Defendant remained liable to repay any non-sustainable debt which remained unconverted after the Scheme was terminated. The Defendant also continues to be in financial difficulties and has suffered losses during the financial years 2009 to 2016.

Where the matters are less complex, the appropriate fees are closer to the $10,266,164 that the Defendant argues should be taken as the appropriate global fees. As for the Singapore cases cited by the Plaintiff, aside from MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (“MF Global”), the rest are all the Plaintiff’s own matters, for which there is no clarity as to how the valuation was obtained. It is also unclear whether the fees charged in these examples included success fees.

As only a broad brush approach could be adopted here, the amount that is fair, adequate and reasonable, taking into account the value contributed by the Plaintiff in the exercise of judgment and expertise, would be the time costs claimed for the periods of 28 October 2008 to 31 May 2011 (including the value reflected in the Credit Note) and August 2011 to November 2012 (both these time costs would already carry a premium over the probable actual time costs that were reasonably incurred for the work), the outstanding disbursements as well as the Deposit of $500,000.

It is correct that in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2015</span>, the Court of Appeal noted that there was “some force” in the argument that <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> had no power to unilaterally order that the VAF be taxed if not agreed by the SM/the Plaintiff, the MC and the Defendant (at [194]–[195]). However, it expressly declined to reconsider the VAF Orders made in <span class="font-italic">TT1 2012</span> (see <span class="font-italic">TTI 2015</span> at [195]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">195 …[I]n our judgment, the fact that the CA may have been wrong in deciding that it had the power to make the VAF Orders does not afford us a basis for reopening [<span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span>] ([3] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), of which the VAF Orders form a part. In the final analysis, the public interest in the finality of litigation must prevail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, the VAF Orders made in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> remain applicable, and were not in any way modified by <span class="font-italic">TTI 2015</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Re Econ (No 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Given the endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Re Econ </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2)</span> by the Court of Appeal (see [33] above), the principles enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Re Econ </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2) </span>are instructive in assessing what would be a fair, reasonable and adequate level of remuneration. These principles apply equally to court-appointed as well as privately-appointed insolvency practitioners (<span class="font-italic">Re Econ </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2) </span>at [44]). In each case, the inquiry would be to “assess the value that the insolvency practitioner has brought to bear” (at [47]). In particular, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re Econ </span><span class="font-italic">(No 2)</span> specified a number of considerations in making this assessment:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was a right to fair and reasonable remuneration, but being remunerated on a time costs basis is not “a matter of right”. The time spent is “only one of several factors” to be taken into account – the precise importance of this factor is case-sensitive (at [45] and [51]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The burden of proof is on the insolvency practitioner that the remuneration is justifiable. The appropriate benchmark is fairness and reasonableness and the court “will carefully scrutinise the facts placed before it” (at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The difference or value brought by the insolvency practitioner is one of the most important aspects affecting his remuneration. The views of the major creditors would be significant, unless they are related entities (at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Rates cannot be taken at face value. The court determines what would be adequate remuneration for “a similarly experienced and qualified” insolvency practitioner. The fact that insolvency practitioners may exercise commercial judgment should not attract special treatment. Major insolvencies may attract different considerations but these are in the “realm of exceptional cases”. Comparative rates by other insolvency practitioners may not serve much use. In the absence of any industry practice, the court should consider a solicitor’s rate (one with similar experience) on an indemnity basis as a possible yardstick in determining the applicable hourly rate of an insolvency practitioner (at [52]–[56]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Claims for assistance of employees in the insolvency practitioners’ firms must be scrutinised to determine if this has been “reasonably incurred” (at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The functions and the responsibilities assumed by the insolvency practitioner should be considered, while considering the demands of the process of insolvency (at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Sufficient particulars of the disbursements claimed must be provided to determine whether they were “reasonably incurred” and if the quantum claimed is “reasonable” (at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The objective of the exercise, prescribed in <span class="font-italic">Re Econ</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2) </span>and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> as applicable to scheme managers, is for sufficient scrutiny to be given to the claim for fees made by the practitioner, to ensure that a fair, adequate and reasonable amount is charged.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Contract stipulates:

I agree that <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> did not find that the Contract should be discarded or ignored. There is nothing in the language of <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> that suggests such a conclusion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, the fact that the Contract remains relevant is not the end of the matter. <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> requires the assessing court to assess what is fair, <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> and adequate. Given that one of the aims is the determination of reasonable fees, the Contract cannot be the start and end points. Otherwise, the court would not need to be involved – the parties could just be held to their contractual agreement and that would be conclusive of the matter. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Indeed, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">TTI 2015</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [57] noted that the “upshot of [</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">TTI 2012</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">] was that [the Plaintiff] was not entitled to the full amount of the VAF under [the Contract]”.</span> This consequence flowed from the fact that the Court of Appeal found that there had been non-disclosure of the VAF to the MC. The Plaintiff argues that the non-disclosure was caused by the Defendant. Whatever the cause of the non-disclosure – whether, as the Plaintiff says, the non-disclosure was the Defendant’s own doing or otherwise – the Court of Appeal had to decide between unravelling the Scheme and allowing it to proceed. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> decided <span class="font-italic">not</span> to unravel the Scheme because it was not “practical to set it aside without causing more harm to the [Defendant] and the creditors”, given that the Scheme had been implemented for more than two years at the time of the decision (at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Given the decision to allow the Scheme to continue, the Court of Appeal could not have allowed the Plaintiff to be remunerated on the basis of the Contract – if it had done so, then there would have been absolutely no consequences to the fact that there was non-disclosure of the VAF to the MC. That was precisely the outcome the Court of Appeal wanted to avoid. Seen in this context, the Contract, which was the very thing that was not disclosed, could not be the controlling or determinative factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Plaintiff argues that weakening the force of the contractual bargain in this way may affect the position of insolvency practitioners and have a chilling effect on the field. However, the precedential effect of this decision is likely to be limited, given that it arose out of the non-disclosure of the Contract to the MC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the creditors. Where a restructuring is undertaken with appropriate disclosure of the scheme manager’s remuneration, the contract for fee agreement will, in the absence of anything else untoward, be given effect. Thus in most restructurings, insolvency practitioners acting as scheme managers can expect to get what they bargained for. There would thus be little by way of a <span class="font-italic">genuine</span> chilling effect if the Contract is not given primacy effect in the present case. It bears emphasis that the approach adopted here is different <span class="font-italic">only</span> because of the material non-disclosure to the MC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The fact that the Defendant, but not the MC, has objected to the Plaintiff’s fees in the Contract, despite agreeing to it from the very beginning, does not change anything. The VAF Orders require the fee to be negotiated between the involved parties, which includes the Defendant. The passivity of the MC does not mean that the fees sought by the Plaintiff should be granted. The weighing of reasonableness, adequacy and fairness still has to be made considering all the relevant factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  I have concluded that the Contract is neither a starting point nor a default basis to ascertain the Plaintiff’s fees. What then is the role of the Contract? At best, the Contract represents the outcome of negotiations only as between the Defendant and the Plaintiff – it cannot be taken to have been agreed by the MC who did not participate in the negotiations leading up to the Contract. Depriving the contract of that controlling role means that the bargain struck between the Plaintiff and the Defendant is given at most secondary weight. Having said that, the Contract is not however irrelevant or immaterial. The Contract is part of the factual matrix that an assessing court considers alongside the factors stated in <span class="font-italic">Re Econ</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span>. In principle, it can be considered in the court’s determination, as an indication of the value that is to be ascribed to the work rendered by the Plaintiff. But it is <span class="font-italic">only</span> one of many factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Crucially, the contractual fee must be shown to have been derived on a reasonable basis. Merely being the product of arm’s length negotiations that was freely entered into does not show that the agreed fee is reasonable. Such a fee might well be reflective of market value, but that is a different inquiry. Market value is often a product of a multitude of factors, particularly demand and supply. Additionally, the relative bargaining power of the parties, the presence/absence of competitors, and the adequacy of information available, will all have an impact. In comparison, the analysis of reasonableness, fairness and adequacy import other considerations such as equity, good faith, and the need to stymie profiteering and windfalls. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the point of the Contract, the Defendant alluded in one of its affidavits to the Sngs’ understanding that “the likely restructuring costs, on a [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] ‘all in’ basis, would be around $10 million”.

</div>
</div> Having considered the evidence, on a balance of probabilities, I find that there was no such understanding. The Contract is unequivocally <span class="font-italic">silent</span> on this alleged $10m “all-in” understanding. Even though it was entirely open to the Defendant to include an express provision in the Contract to record this alleged understanding, there is nothing in the negotiations and/or correspondence which evidences this. It is important to bear in mind that the Defendant is a sophisticated commercial entity, listed on the SGX Main Board, and was at all times legally advised. There is simply no excuse for the Defendant not to have included such a material term in the Contract if indeed there was any such understanding. In this vein, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 63 are apposite: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 …[N]o explanation was offered for the parties’ failure to put the alleged tripartite contractual agreement to set off in writing. … [O]ne would have expected that <span class="font-italic">sophisticated commercial parties</span><span class="font-italic"> … would not have agreed to deal with each other without ensuring that their contractual arrangements have been comprehensively evidenced by proper legal documentation</span> … Here we are not dealing with two individuals, or small entities, which have carried on their business relationship in an informal manner.

As the professionals in the latter category are appointed by the court, it would be expected that their conduct and remuneration would be subject to some scrutiny by the court. Scheme managers, on the other hand, are appointed essentially by either the company or the creditors on a <span class="font-italic">private</span> basis.

Contrary to the Plaintiff’s attempts to characterise the value it contributed through the mathematical calculation in the VAF Formula, the exercise to be undertaken is not a mathematical, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, solely quantitative, assessment (see [33] above). It is insufficient for the Plaintiff to merely allege that the VAF Formula reflects the direct and tangible benefit derived by the Defendant from the Plaintiff’s work. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TTI</span> <span class="font-italic">2012</span> emphasised that the value should be measured in terms of “the tangible results for the creditors and the company, as opposed to the <span class="font-italic">mere quantum of debt</span> involved” (at [31]) [emphasis added].

It was the Defendant and not the Plaintiff that had secured the necessary loan facilities and other investments to continue with the Big Box Project. In a related vein, the Plaintiff also argues that it should be credited with its efforts in preventing the Defendant from being liquidated, which was the reason why the Defendant could proceed with the Big Box Project in the first place. If such an argument is accepted, for any company under a scheme of arrangement, it would mean that the value of every successful project or investment (post-scheme) can be attributed to the scheme manager’s efforts since these projects would not have been possible if the company had went under. That logically cannot be right. What needs to be assessed is who had primarily contributed to the project’s success.

The object of the analysis of value is accrual of value in terms of the assets of the company, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, how much better it is in terms of financial value, because of the efforts of the scheme manager. While it is possible that the Defendant may benefit in a sense from the continued solvency of the Sngs, its founders and perhaps driving spirit, their relationship is too remote for the purposes of determining the value of work done for the Defendant. For the same reasons, any value derived by the Defendant’s creditors from the Scheme is also immaterial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In relation to the points made about the Defendant remaining a going concern, the Defendant’s employees not losing their jobs and the Defendant’s consumers being protected, these are aspects that will naturally feature in any reasonably successful schemes of arrangement.

</div> In my judgment, these are insufficient. The fact that there are similar hourly rates only helps to show that the rates themselves are not disproportionate. It does not substantiate or support the conclusion that the rates are reasonable for the work done. As for the prior agreement or consent of the Defendant and/or the MC, that is not conclusive in light of the directions in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span> for an assessment of a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> fee. If anything, the fact that a whopping $6.3m was charged for time costs in the first year alone strongly suggests that the Billed Time Costs are unlikely to be reasonable. In these circumstances, allowing full recovery for the Billed Time Costs will mean that a premium over and above the actual time costs incurred would be awarded to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In respect of the Unbilled Time Costs, I agree with the Defendant that <span class="font-italic">Re Econ</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span> requires cogent evidence to be given, so that there is at least <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> substantiation of the amounts claimed. In fact, showing that a set number of hours has been spent on a matter would not even be sufficient. Time spent needs to be linked to specific categories of work done, which in turn must be related to the scope of the engagement (see the Appendix to <span class="font-italic">Re Econ (No 2)</span>). It is only with this information that an assessment can be properly done. In the present case, the Plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence to justify the Unbilled Time Costs. The Plaintiff only makes reference to an agreed fixed monthly fee from August 2011 to July 2012, which again has limited relevance in assessing a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> fee, and the time costs for the period from August 2012 to November 2012. In respect of both time periods, there is no evidence of the number of hours worked, what the Plaintiff’s work entailed and the number of staff deployed. In the absence of the requisite evidence to justify the Unbilled Time Costs, to nevertheless allow full recovery for these unbilled time costs would also most probably award the Plaintiff a premium over the actual time costs incurred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Comparison evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Plaintiff relies on examples of professional fees charged in other restructuring engagements to indicate benchmarks for comparison. These examples are what could be obtained from public sources. While some of the comparators were the Plaintiff’s own engagements, the Plaintiff submits that these should not be disregarded as they were fees that were charged and “willingly paid” – these fees reflect the then prevailing market rates in Singapore which companies were prepared to pay for being advised on restructuring. In fact, one of the examples tendered, involving Jaya Holdings Limited (“Jaya”), handled by the Plaintiff, would perhaps be the “most comparable case” to the Defendant’s context in terms of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the quantum of debt restructured: in that case fees totalling about $21.1m, with a VAF of $15m was charged and paid.

Complex insolvencies such as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc (“Lehman Brothers”) and Nortel Network Corporation (“Nortel”) would naturally have resulted in larger quantum of fees being incurred. Instead, the fees charged in less complex matters such as Farepak Food &amp; Gifts and Alpari (UK) Limited were within the range of about $10.3m which the Defendant submits is appropriate in the present case. Additionally, it is not “a fair or objective comparison” for the court to look at matters which are the Plaintiff’s own. In any event, in relation to some of the examples such as Citiraya Industries Ltd (“Citiraya”), it is also unclear whether the figures indicated were pure time costs or whether they included a success fee.

But that assistance is premised on like being compared with like: that the facts underlying each case or precedent bear a resemblance to what is before the court. The difficulty with precedents for legal costs is that much would have to turn on the facts of the specific case. The variation is further compounded when one turns to comparisons between fees charged in restructuring schemes. What makes the situation even more complex is that unlike legal costs, which are ultimately determined by the court and for which there are guidelines in place, fees for schemes are currently left entirely for determination by the market forces. There is no third party control on the fees imposed. The comparisons must thus be considered only as indicative of what may be agreed. Even if the schemes in question are comparable, it by no means automatically follows that the fees agreed are fair and reasonable. Percentage indications, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fees charged in proportion to the total debts restructured, are also not that useful – larger deals may attract lower percentages, while lower deals may attract larger percentages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Of the comparisons made by the Plaintiff, I leave aside Lehman Brothers and Nortel, as these were large, multi-jurisdictional restructurings and insolvencies. Both were of an entirely different scale in terms of the value, legal issues and cross-border elements involved. I also did not place much weight on the fees charged in foreign insolvencies – the circumstances, framework and thus work done for restructurings in other jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia may differ materially. Without further submissions on whether this is so, it would not be meaningful to look to these as comparators.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 That leaves then the restructurings that took place in Singapore. Of these, MF Global was a significantly complex bankruptcy, for which I accept different considerations may have applied in determining the professional fees. As highlighted by the Defendant, the matter engaged multiple jurisdictions and involved numerous customers as well as creditors competing in relation to assets in all the various jurisdictions (moneys were owed to both customers as well as creditors).

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Response to the Plaintiff’s Exhibits dated 10 March 2017, Annex A.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> MF Global had over 6000 customers with “complex trading positions” in various types of financial contracts. As noted by MF Global’s liquidator, Mr Bob Yap, MF Global is “one of the biggest and most complex bankruptcies in Singapore because of the number of customers involved and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the business” and the task of “sorting out customers from creditors and customers’ entitlements was complex and laborious” (see “MF Global Singapore creditors may get as much as 91% of money back”, <span class="font-italic">Media Release</span> (28 May 2012)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Lastly, the fees charged in relation to the Plaintiff’s own work, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Citiraya, Jaya, and Seatown Corporation Ltd, could not be of much weight. The fact that the Plaintiff may have asked for and been paid the fees in question could not be evidence of the <span class="font-italic">reasonableness</span> of the fees charged by the Plaintiff in the present case, since in those cases, that specific question of reasonableness was not an issue. What these fees merely show is what the market is willing to pay, which, as noted above at [45], is not the relevant inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Overall assessment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In this application, the Plaintiff seeks a total payment in excess of $39.6m for its work done for the Defendant (see [13] above). In this connection, it bears pointing out that despite already being paid some $10.8m (~$10.3m + the Deposit), the Plaintiff is additionally claiming (a) $1.27m in unpaid time costs, (b) the VAF of $27.6m plus 5% of the Disputed Claims and (c) disbursements amounting to $3285.40. Even if the actual VAF to be determined based on the formula set out at [38] above yields a lower figure, the possible sum for the VAF is nevertheless an estimated <span class="font-italic">$15m </span>to<span class="font-italic"> $30m</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>– as observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TTI 2012</span>, “[b]y any standard, this is an extraordinary amount that will leave many breathless” (at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As noted above, it is not possible to come to a clear conclusion on the value that was created by the Plaintiff’s efforts. This thus leaves me with only a broad-brush approach to determine what would be a fair, adequate and reasonable fee for the Plaintiff’s efforts. Certainly, there is some element of contribution by the Plaintiff, but it is not anywhere close to the contractual figure nearing $28m. In the calculation the Plaintiff puts forth, the value of the items to be counted as part of the base figure includes various assets, funds and projects that cannot be unequivocally ascribed to the Plaintiff’s efforts, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Big Box Project and the increase in share price could not be wholly or even significantly credited to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Holistically considering the value of the work, the time costs, and the other relevant factors, I am of the view that an appropriate figure that provides a fair, reasonable and adequate compensation is an uplift on the actual time costs incurred. As noted above at [60]–[61], both the Billed Time Costs and the Unbilled Time Costs are to be taken to already include a premium over the actual time costs. One possible approach is to discount the premium from the actual time costs and then add an element for any extra value added that was not covered by the time costs, including compensation for any special expertise or judgment exercised. But as noted above, any such calculation, especially the quantification of the latter element, would be largely speculative. The preferable option instead is to treat these additional premiums as the compensation for the value contributed by the Plaintiff for the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the absence of clear evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s claim, allowing the Plaintiff to fully recover the Billed Time Costs, the Unbilled Time Costs, disbursements as well as the $500,000 Deposit, would seem to be a fair, reasonable and adequate fee, considering the value in question as best as can be determined now, the time expended, and the Scheme created. This sum might be quite far off the amount claimed by the Plaintiff under the Contract. It is certainly not what the Plaintiff expected when it embarked on the work. But the Plaintiff’s expectation does not determine the assessment – instead the task entrusted to this court is to determine a fair, adequate and reasonable fee. One’s expectation would not necessarily reflect a fair or a reasonable fee, at least from an objective or neutral perspective.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In relation to the outstanding disbursements of $3285.40 (before GST), I allow this claim for two reasons. First, from a perusal of the Plaintiff’s policy terms for charging of disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses to its clients,

This was a waiver by the Plaintiff of the sum of $401,150 owed by the Defendant on the <span class="font-italic">condition</span> that the payment owing from the Defendant was to be paid within a certain time. As it turned out, the Defendant made a belated payment. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to hold the Plaintiff to the Credit Note because the conditions for triggering the note were not met and the value of the note should thus not be deducted. Accordingly, the Defendant should pay $401,150 to the Plaintiff for the time costs incurred by the Plaintiff in April 2009. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Just a week before the parties were to file their written submissions, the Plaintiff filed Summons No 560 of 2017 to seek leave for the former lawyer acting for the Defendant in the matter, to give evidence orally and/or produce documents on behalf of the Plaintiff.

All in all, these sums add up to a total professional fee of $12,042,899.40. Accordingly, in addition to the $10,766,164 ($10,266,164 + $500,000 Deposit) that has already been paid by the Defendant, the Defendant has to pay the Plaintiff an additional $1,276,735.40. Since these sums exclude the corresponding GST, any unpaid GST has to also be paid by the Defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Directions for arguments on costs will be given separately. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Edwin Tong SC, Kenneth Lim Tao Chung (Kenneth Lin Daocong), Peh Aik Hin, Tham Chuen Min, Jasmine (Tan Jianmin) and Chua Xinying (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chan Hock Keng, Ong Pei Chin, Lawrence Foo and Chong Wan Yee Monica (Zhang Wanyu) (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
