The PRC should therefore be the natural forum. Further, save for the fact that the “Sea Justice” was arrested in Singapore, there are no other connecting factors to Singapore such that the dispute over liability (and damages) should be heard here. The Defendant further contends that there were material non-disclosures made by the Plaintiff in its application for the warrant to arrest of the “Sea Justice”, and the said warrant should accordingly be set aside. For the two reasons mentioned above, the Defendant submits that the security obtained in exchange for the release of the “Sea Justice” should therefore be returned in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In response, the Plaintiff contends that the Stay Application should not be granted as, amongst other arguments made, the Defendant has not shown that the PRC is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum such that substantial justice cannot be obtained by the Plaintiff in the PRC, and that there are, in any case, no concerns of infringing international comity since the Qingdao Court has denied the Defendant’s application for a worldwide behaviour preservation order to restrain parties like the Plaintiff from commencing legal proceedings against the Defendant in a foreign jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As regards the alleged material non-disclosures, the Plaintiff submitted that full and frank disclosure has been made and the warrant of arrest should not be set aside. Accordingly, the Plaintiff should not be ordered to return the security obtained from the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 During the course of hearings, the Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Timothy Tan, made an alternative submission. He submitted that should the Court decide to grant the Stay Application, the Court should also grant a “case management stay” or a “conditional stay”. The gist of such a stay is as follows: The proceedings in Singapore be stayed in favour of Qingdao Court on condition that (a) the security obtained from the Defendant remains with the Plaintiff, and (b) liberty be granted to the Plaintiff to lift the stay to enforce the Chinese judgment (assuming it prevails in Qingdao Court), to claim damages it could not have claimed against the security obtained from the Defendant. The Plaintiff argued that it would not be doubly compensated because the amount which the Plaintiff had claimed against the Defendant was over US$ 112.3m, and the SJ Limitation Fund was only just over US$ 6.1m. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The issues that the Court have to determine are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">First, </span>whether the Court should grant a stay of the Singapore proceedings in favour of the proceedings in the Qingdao Court? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Second</span>, whether the warrant of arrest granted on 19 October 2022 should be set aside for material non-disclosure? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">Third</span>, if the Court decides to grant a stay of the Singapore proceedings, what order should the Court make with respect to the security that was furnished by the Defendant to secure the release of the “Sea Justice”?

As they do not speak the Mandarin language, the language of proceedings in the Qingdao Court, the Qingdao Court is a less appropriate forum. It is also unnecessary to call in the marine surveyors as the parties could get documentary records of their findings, and they can travel to Singapore if need be. Although the Chinese Maritime Authority (“CMA”) had investigated the Collision and had produced an investigation report (the “CMA Investigation Report”), and the impact of the oil pollution was investigated and documented by various Chinese government ministries (the “Oil Pollution Report”), the reports stemming from these investigations were, in the Plaintiff’s view, irrelevant to the dispute.

The <span class="font-italic">Eleftheria </span>factors are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in what country is the evidence on the issues of fact situated or more readily available, and the effect of that on the relative convenience and expense of the trial as between the Singapore and the foreign court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the law of the foreign court applies, and, if so, whether it differs from Singapore law in any material respects;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) with what country either party is connected, and if so, how closely;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country, or are only seeking procedural advantages; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court because they would:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) be deprived of security for their claim;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) be unable to enforce any judgment obtained;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) be faced with a time bar not applicable here; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) for political, racial, religious or other reasons be unlikely to get a fair trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Other general factors the Court should consider are the personal connections of the parties and witnesses, connections to relevant events and transactions, applicable law, <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span> (through the risk of overlapping judgments), and the shape of litigation, though these factors should not be applied mechanically (see <span class="font-italic">Tania Rappo</span> at [71]). As a general principle, the place where a tort was committed is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for that tortious claim (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Reecon Wolf”</span> [2012] 2 SLR 289 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span>”) at [16] and <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [106], citing <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Furthermore, in an admiralty claim, the nature and existence of multiple or concurrent proceedings and the weight to be given to this factor will depend on all the circumstances of the case, including how advanced the other foreign action is, consequences of ongoing proceedings in terms of inconvenience, expenses, and other matters such as the risk of conflicting judgments (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> at [17]). The risk of conflicting judgments arising from concurrent proceedings is not necessarily a decisive factor in determining whether a stay should be ordered, and this must be weighed against the other factors in the overall <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> analysis (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stage 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At the second stage, the main consideration is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreign court (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [43]). The question is whether the foreign court would be able to try the dispute in a manner which is procedurally and substantively fair (see <span class="font-italic">Tania Rappo</span> at [110]). The burden lies on the plaintiff to establish “objectively by cogent evidence” that there is some personal or juridical advantage available to the plaintiff in the Singapore proceedings, and that it is of such importance that it would cause injustice to the plaintiff to deprive the plaintiff of it (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As to what constates a personal or juridical advantage, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>held (at [37]) that “[i]t would be contrary to <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> principles to look favourably upon a party who selected a forum based solely upon the level of damages that could be awarded or higher limits of liability”. The court therefore concluded (at [55]) that the existence of different limitation regimes is not considered a personal or juridical advantage under Stage 2. This is important and I will come back to this in my analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, I am of the view that the dispute was not sufficiently connected to Singapore for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Preliminary Issue: Does the </span>Spiliada<span class="font-italic"> test apply to an action in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span>?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 ADM 61 started out as an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>.

The parties did not dispute that the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test applies to an action <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span>. For completeness, and in any case, the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> principles and the Court’s discretion are not affected by the fact that the proceedings are <span class="font-italic">in rem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see<span class="font-italic"> The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stage 1 Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Where did the tort take place, and which law should apply?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I start by considering where the tort took place, and what the applicable law of the tort is.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Undisputedly, the tort — that is, the Collision — took place in Chinese territorial waters. Therefore, the PRC is the natural forum, and the applicable law of the tort is Chinese law. It is also undisputedly Chinese law that would be better applied in the Chinese courts. The PRC’s legal system is one of civil law, as opposed to the common law legal system which the Singapore courts use. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Plaintiff argued in its oral submissions that the Singapore court would have no issue applying Chinese law, as both the PRC and Singapore have acceded to the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (the “COLREGS”). However, the Plaintiff placed no material before me stating that the manner in which the COLREGS are interpreted and applied is the same in PRC as it is in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any case, the invocation of the COLREGS is in relation to the issue of apportioning liability of the parties in the Collision. In this regard, the issue of damages will be based on the prevailing laws of each jurisdiction, and again, no material has been placed before me as to whether the courts in the PRC assess damages in the same way as the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At present, Singapore is a party to the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (the “1976 LLMC”), as amended by the Protocol of 1996 (“1996 Protocol”). The 1976 LLMC and 1996 Protocol were incorporated into Singapore’s domestic law by way of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The 1996 Protocol raises the limits of liability of the shipowner for maritime claims covered under the 1976 LLMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In contrast, the PRC is not a state party to the 1976 LLMC or the 1996 Protocol. Instead, its limitation regime is based on domestically enacted laws being Chapter 11 of the Maritime Code on the rights and conditions of the limitation of liability for maritime claims. While it was not submitted by either party how different the limitation regime domestically enacted in the PRC is vis-à-vis the limitation regime the 1996 Protocol which Singapore recognises, it was undisputed between parties that the 1996 Protocol provided for a <span class="font-italic">much higher</span> limitation liability quantum wise as compared to the regime in the PRC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In sum, there was no evidence before the court to conclude that the laws on apportioning liability for maritime collisions or calculating the damages that would arise from such a collision as applied in the PRC is the same as how it is applied in Singapore. Further, how liability and damages are to be decided in respect of the environmental impact caused by the oil spill following the Collision was also not placed before me. Even if the Singapore courts can determine the issue of liability on the assumption that the COLREGS in both countries are interpreted and applied in the same manner, how should the damages caused to the environment be quantified and apportioned? These are all questions that the Chinese courts will be better placed to answer considering that Chinese law will be applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I pause to deal with one of the Plaintiff’s objections at this juncture. At the hearing, the Plaintiff attempted to argue a version of the presumption of similarity; that since the Defendant had not argued that the COLREGS were applied different in the PRC, it had to be presumed that the COLREGS applied similarly in both Singapore and the PRC. The Plaintiff submitted that if the Defendant says that there are differences, the burden of proof lies with the Defendant to prove otherwise and they have not discharged their burden (see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 (“<span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings</span>”) at [60] and [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Apart from the fact that this submission is very much technical in nature and sheds no light on whether there indeed are differences as to how both jurisdictions apply and interpret the COLREGS, the Plaintiff’s submission ignores the fact that the Defendant did plead one fundamental fact: the fact that the legal system in the PRC is a civil law system and Singapore’s is a common law one.

</div> This, taken together with the fact that the limitation regimes in the PRC and Singapore are based on different sets of laws, shifts the burden of proof to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has to show that the manner in which liability and damages are assessed in both countries are the same or at the very least largely similar. As I alluded to above, the Plaintiff tendered no material to this effect. I was therefore not persuaded that the Singapore courts will have no issue applying Chinese law purely because both the PRC and Singapore have acceded to the COLREGS.

The underlying concern is the need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole (see <span class="font-italic">Best Soar </span><span class="font-italic">v Praxis Energy Agents </span>at [39], citing <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam and another </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1 at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On point (a), in my view, there is a significant overlap between the claims before the Qingdao Court and the Singapore court. As both proceedings concern liability for the Collision, i.e., which vessel was at fault which ultimately led to the Collision, the same facts would be in issue and the testimony of the same witnesses will be required. It would therefore follow that there will be a real risk of conflicting decisions in respect of the present action and the Chinese proceedings if both proceedings are allowed to continue concurrently (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [17], quoting Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on <span class="font-italic">The Conflict of Laws, </span>Vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at [12-036] that “if genuine proceedings have been started and had some impact on the dispute between the parties…then this may be a relevant (but not necessarily decisive) factor whether the foreign jurisdiction provides the appropriate forum”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As for point (b), the dispute as to Collision liability would involve the same witnesses testifying at both the Qingdao Court and the Singapore court. This is more likely to inconvenience parties, as it duplicates the time, costs, and efforts. Having duplicate proceedings would be of great inconvenience to the witnesses, which should be given some weight (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [42], adopting Sheen J’s observations in <span class="font-italic">The Wellamo </span>[1980] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 229 that “the convenience of those who are professionally interested in litigation should carry little weight in comparison with the convenience of those whose normal occupation in life will be interrupted by attendance in court to give evidence”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 With respect to point (c), the Plaintiff argued that because the Qingdao Court denied the Defendant’s ASI Application, allowing the Singapore proceedings to continue is not at odds with international comity. The Plaintiff goes one step further. They argued that staying the proceedings in Singapore would be <span class="font-italic">against</span> the principles of international comity, since the denial of the Defendant’s ASI Application makes clear that the Qingdao Court permits proceedings elsewhere in the world to take place, concurrent to the proceedings at the Qingdao Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 With respect, I disagree with the Plaintiff’s submission. First, nothing in the court’s judgment said anything to that degree. For clarity, I reproduce the relevant portion of the Defendant’s English translation of the Qingdao Court’s Civil Ruling on the ASI Application (which translation is substantially similar to the Plaintiff’s

In this case, Symphony Company’s act of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">first filling</span> a lawsuit in the Marshall High Court did not violate the laws and regulations of our country. At the same time, the amount that Sea Justice Company appealed to Symphony Company was RMB 5 million. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">At present,</span> there is no evidence to show that the behaviour of Symphony Company has made it difficult to enforce the judgment of the Chinese court or caused the legal rights and interests of Sea Justice Company to be violated.

Pertinently, the Qingdao Court gave no reasons as to why the ASI Application in respect of proceedings in <span class="font-italic">other countries</span> was rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, the Qingdao Court’s ruling in the ASI Application seems to concern itself only with the Marshall Islands Claim and whether the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court would be affected in any way. While I accept that the ruling allows parties like that the Plaintiff to commence legal proceedings against the Defendant in other jurisdiction, nowhere in the grounds explicitly encourages the Plaintiff to do so. The submission by the Plaintiff that staying the Singapore proceedings would <span class="font-italic">go against</span> international comity is, with respect, pitching its case too high. At best, the Singapore proceedings does not <span class="font-italic">contravene</span> international comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Second, even if I were to take the Plaintiff’s case on this point at its highest, international comity goes further than whether a certain jurisdiction permits parallel proceedings to commence somewhere else. International comity is not premised on mere courtesy, but rather, the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [23]). Put simply, even though the ASI Application was denied, international comity requires the Court to recognise the right of the Qingdao Court to adjudicate fault for the Collision and the Defendant’s right to limit claims made as a result of the Collision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Not only is it oppressive for the Defendant to defend themselves on two fronts and for the parties to expend double the amount of time and resources over the same Collision (see <span class="font-italic">Tania Rappo</span> at [65]), parallel proceedings are inherently undesirable as it increases the risk of inconsistent judgments, which goes against international comity. Furthermore, inconsistent judgments may create friction between different jurisdictions. As noted in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [24], this has been judicially acknowledged by the concept of comity as a discretionary power for a judge to stay proceedings on the ground that there should not be “an unseemly race to be the first to obtain judgment…between two civilised and friendly states” (see <span class="font-italic">The Abidin Daver </span>[1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 339 at 344).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 While the multiplicity of proceedings is not determinative, it is one of the many factors to be considered by the Court (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [90]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Plaintiff cited the Hong Kong cases of <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “CF Crystal” and The “Sanchi” </span>[2018] HKCFI 2474 (“<span class="font-italic">The CF Crystal</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang Iron &amp; Steel Co Ltd &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Ors v Hui Rong NAV Corp SA &amp; Ors </span>[2008] HKCU 1326 (“<span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang</span>”) for the proposition that multiplicity of proceedings should not be considered a weighty factor. These were cases where the Court had dismissed the defendant’s application to stay the proceedings commenced in one court in favour of another court, and had instead allowed both proceedings in both courts to continue concurrently, i.e. the parties were allowed to continue having their claims heard in Hong Kong instead of an alternative maritime court elsewhere in the PRC. In my view, these two cases can be distinguished from the present case on the facts. I explain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The CF Crystal </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">The CF Crystal</span>, a collision on 6 January 2018 between the defendant’s cargo vessel, “CF Crystal” and the plaintiff’s tanker, “Sanchi”, led to the “Sanchi” exploding and sinking. The collision took place in the East China Sea which was outside the PRC territorial waters but within the PRC’s exclusive economic zone (“EEZ”). It bears mentioning that the point of collision also lay within the EEZ of South Korea and Japan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On 9 January 2018, the plaintiff, Bright Shipping, commenced legal proceedings against the defendant, Changhong, in the Hong Kong Court. On the same day, Changhong commenced legal proceedings against Bright Shipping in the Shanghai Maritime Court (“SMC”). Two limitation funds were subsequently constituted in the SMC. Changhong applied to stay the proceedings in the Hong Kong Court on grounds of <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span> and submitted that the matter should be tried in Shanghai since the proceedings in the SMC were on-going. The Court of First Instance dismissed the application and the decision was upheld by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal (“HKCA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In coming to its decision, the HKCA held that that “as the PRC is not a state party to the LLMC, there is no statutory bar on Bright Shipping [the plaintiff] bringing this action against Changhong [the defendant] in Hong Kong, notwithstanding the constitution of the limitation fund by Changhong in the SMC” (see <span class="font-italic">The CF Crystal</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [26]). In light of the court’s acceptance that proceedings can take place simultaneously in two courts, the Plaintiff submits that the multiplicity of proceedings factor should not be given much weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I disagree. In my view, <span class="font-italic">The CF Crystal</span> can be distinguished on two grounds. First, as the collision took place in a EEZ shared by Japan, Korea and the PRC, and not in the PRC territorial waters, there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>natural forum for the collision claim unlike in the present case. This meant that the place of the tort was a neutral factor. Second, the HKCA placed weight on the fact that Bright Shipping did not accept service of Changhong’s proceedings in the SMC and that those proceedings did not move beyond the stage of the initiating process (see [32] of <span class="font-italic">The CF Crystal</span>). The Court further held in the same paragraph that “as Bright Shipping has not submitted and does not intend to submit to the jurisdiction of the SMC, the possibility of conflicting decisions and the problem relating to estoppel per rem judicatam and issue estoppel will not arise”. This is pertinent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the present case, it was undisputed that the Plaintiff actively participated in the Qingdao Court proceedings. Not only did it file a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund set up by the Defendant, it has also filed its own inter-ship claim against the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s PRC lawyers had also made oral submissions on the Plaintiff’s defence on the issue of liability for the Collision and on the evidence tendered by the Defendant at the 19 April 2022 Hearing. Further, the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s lawyers had also conferred on the evidence tendered by the parties and jointly confirmed in writing to the Qingdao Court on the authenticity of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 There is no evidence that the Plaintiff intends to stop participating in the Qingdao Court proceedings. If the proceedings in the Qingdao Court continue, the Qingdao Court will arrive at a decision on liability and damages. There will therefore be a real risk of inconsistent judgments, and for the reasons explained above, this should be avoided. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Shijiazhuang </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In <span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang</span>, the plaintiffs were the owners of the cargo on board the cargo vessel, “Hui Rong”. On 17 March 2007, the “Hui Rong” collided with the “Peng Yen” in PRC waters and the “Hui Rong”, together with the goods she was carrying, sank. The plaintiffs commenced legal proceedings against the owners of “Peng Yen” (the “Owners”) in the Hong Kong Court. On 12 May 2007, “Peng Wei”, a sister ship of “Peng Yen”, was arrested in Hong Kong but was released shortly thereafter against the security of a Letter of Undertaking from the Owner’s insurers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In March 2008, other claimants commenced proceedings against the Owners in the Ningbo Maritime Court (“NMC”). On 30 April 2008, the Owners applied to constitute a limitation fund there and its application was approved. The Owners then applied to stay the Hong Kong Court proceedings in favour of proceedings in the NMC. The Court dismissed the application after it found, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the Owners, having freely made the choice to constitute a limitation fund in NMC despite the fact that litigation before the Hong Kong Courts have commenced should “also take any consequences” which may flow from their decision (see <span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang</span> at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 <span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang </span>can be distinguished from the present case on the ground that the Owners in <span class="font-italic">Shijiazhuang</span> had constituted the limitation fund in NMC almost 10 months <span class="font-italic">after</span> the arrest of the “Peng Wei” in Hong Kong, when proceedings in the Hong Kong Court had already commenced. It was therefore unsurprising that the Hong Kong Court held that the Owners must bear the consequences of their choice since they knew that proceedings in the Hong Kong Court was on-going before they commenced proceedings in NMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In our present case, although ADM 61 was filed before the SJ Limitation Fund was constituted on 12 July 2021, the writ was never served on the “Sea Justice”. It was only served when the “Sea Justice” was arrested on 20 October 2022, more than one year <span class="font-italic">after</span> the SJ Limitation Fund was constituted. Hence, it cannot be said that the Defendant had constituted the SJ Limitation Fund knowing that litigation before the Singapore courts was afoot.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Has the Plaintiff submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As a starting point, whether a party submitted to the jurisdiction of another court is not <span class="font-italic">determinative</span> of whether a stay should be immediately ordered. The presence of concurrent proceedings in another jurisdiction heightens the risk of inconsistent judgments and goes against the grain of international comity. This point was undisputed by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The parties’ experts took opposite positions on whether the Plaintiff had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. Professor Zhao Jinsong (“Prof Zhao”), who was the Defendant’s expert on Chinese maritime law, took the view that the Plaintiff has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. Prof Chu, who was the Plaintiff’s expert on Chinese maritime law, took the converse view, i.e. that the Plaintiff cannot be said to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The questions that were posed to them were as follows, does the:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">a. Plaintiff’s claim against the SJ Limitation Fund;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">b. Plaintiff’s participation in the Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">c. filing of the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim in the Qingdao Court; and</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">d. the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund by the Plaintiff and NEPIA,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">collectively referred to as the Four Concurrent Proceedings in the Qingdao Court, constitute the Plaintiff submitting to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court under Chinese Law?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The Plaintiff’s View: Professor Chu’s Opinion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 A summary of Prof Chu’s findings, pertinent to the present issue, is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">a. the Plaintiff’s participation in the Four Concurrent Proceedings does not (i) prevent the Plaintiff from suing elsewhere to obtain security, and (ii) mean that the Plaintiff has <span class="font-italic">clearly</span> and <span class="font-italic">unconditionally</span> submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court; and

</div> In his view, there could be no such “submission to jurisdiction” so long as (a) the jurisdiction was acquired over the case mandatorily, (b) the parties can still file cases elsewhere, and (c) the Plaintiff’s reservation of rights only reserves the right to raise possible jurisdictional defences (even though its reservation did not expressly address jurisdictional issues or any waiver of the foreign court’s jurisdiction).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In relation to the Plaintiff’s act of registering its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund, Prof Chu submitted that the Plaintiff did not submit to the jurisdiction of Qingdao Court as the Qingdao Court was not the Court chosen by the Plaintiff on its own initiative.

</div>
</div> In other words, what Prof Chu seems to suggest is that because the Plaintiff had to protect its interests after the Defendant had commenced legal proceedings against the Plaintiff in the Qingdao Court, the Plaintiff’s act of registering its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund was not voluntary and therefore does not mean that it had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 According to him, under the Maritime Procedure Law, the establishment of a limitation fund, the registration of claims by creditors, and the filing of confirmation proceedings by creditors are basic procedures regarding the limitation of liability for maritime claims; the Plaintiff’s act of registering the claim was simply what the Plaintiff was required to do in order for it to bring a claim against the limitation fund that the Defendant constituted, and not a decision to submit to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court on its own accord.

Therefore, the Plaintiff’s registration of its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund was based on special provisions that granted mandatory jurisdiction to the QMC over the Plaintiff.

</div> He specifically cites Article 4.1 of the Several Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court on the Trial of Cases of Disputes over the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claim (the “SPC Rules on Limitation of Liability), which I reproduce for clarity below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Upon the constitution of the fund for limitation of liability for maritime claims, the maritime court in which the fund has been constituted <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall have the jurisdiction</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>over a lawsuit filed by the maritime court in which the fund has been constituted shall have the jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed by the maritime claimant against the liable part on the relevant disputes over the maritime accident.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, as pointed out by the Plaintiff’s counsel, Prof Zhao’s opinion in the present case on this issue seemed to be contrary to the previous opinion he expressed in an Australian case of <span class="font-italic">CMA CGM SA v Ship Chou Shan</span> [2014] FCA 74(2014) (“<span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span>”)<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span>, the defendant ship, the “Chou Shan” collided with the plaintiff ship, the “MV CMA CGM Florida” (“CCF”) in the EEZ of the PRC. Three weeks after the collision, the owners of the CCF commenced proceedings in the Australian court. About a month thereafter, the owners of the  “Chou Shan” applied to the Ningbo Maritime Court (“NMC”) to establish a limitation fund under Chinese law. Claims against the fund were made by the owners of “CCF” in NMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The “Chou Shan’s” interests subsequently applied to the NMC for a warrant to arrest the “CCF” in NMC. The “CCF’s” interests also applied to the Australian court for a warrant to arrest the “Chou Shan”. It transpired that the “CCF” was later arrested in the PRC and so did the “Chou Shan”, which was later was arrested in Port Hedland, Western Australia. The “Chou Shan’s” interests applied to the Australian court to stay the Australian proceedings in favour of the NMC proceedings on two grounds. The first is that Australia is a clearly inappropriate forum for the hearing and determination of the dispute. The second is that the existence of the Chinese proceeding, in which the “CCF” interests are “actively and voluntarily participating”, renders the continuation of the proceedings in Australia vexatious and oppressive (see <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span> at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 One issue that arose was whether “CCF’s” act of making claims against the limitation fund in NMC amounted to “CCF” having submitted to the jurisdiction of China. Prof Zhao, who had testified on behalf of the owners of the “CCF” as an expert on Chinese maritime law submitted that the registration of claims against a limitation fund by a party did <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute a submission to the jurisdiction of the PRC. I recount the relevant portion of that judgment here for clarity (see <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span> at [97]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Professor Zhao expresses the view that as a matter of law, if the [plaintiff’s] interests had failed to register their claim with the Ningbo Maritime Court, they would waive all rights to claim against the limitation fund constituted by the Chou Shan owner…It would only be by registering the claim against the limitation fund that the plaintiffs would be able to recover compensation from the Chou Shan owners in China arising from the collision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, if the plaintiffs do not want to lose any rights to recover compensation from the Chou Shan owners in China, and assuming all claims may be subject to limitation, they must register their claims with the Ningbo Maritime Court against the fund. The failure to do so would be a waiver of any right. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The registration of the claim against the fund is only an expression to the court of willingness not to give up the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">right to the claim against the fund; it does not constitute a submission to the jurisdiction of China, according to Professor Zhao.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Prof Zhao’s evidence in <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span> directly contradicts his expert opinion in the present case. The Defendant’s counsel attempted to distinguish Prof Zhao’s evidence in <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan </span>by submitted that his evidence in <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span> may have been given based on the state of the law then, and that the law, at present, may have since changed. This was however unconvincing and unpersuasive as no evidence was adduced before this Court to show that there was indeed such a change in the law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Court’s Preferred View</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Defendant argued that because the Court did not have the opportunity to hear from Prof Zhao as to why his opinion in the present case was diametrically opposite from what he had given before in <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span>, his opinion, as given in the present case, should still be reliable. I disagree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan, </span>Prof Zhao was asked the very same question: does the act of registering a claim against a limitation fund in the PRC amount to submitting to the jurisdiction where the fund had been constituted? His answer was no. There was therefore, in my view, no ambiguity that the view he had proffered in the present case is opposite from what he had proffered in <span class="font-italic">The Chou Shan</span>. If anything, Prof Zhao should have explained why he had reached a different conclusion in his report. This he did not do. Considering that no evidence has been put forth to support and justify Prof Zhao reaching a diametrically opposite opinion, I am of the view that his opinion on this issue is unreliable and place no weight on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Just because Prof Zhao’s evidence on this issue cannot be relied upon does not mean that Prof Chu’s evidence should automatically be accepted. The Court should still “examine the correctness of the expert’s premises and reasoning process, as well as whether the expert is really purporting to address the issue or point on which his opinion has been sought” (see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace)</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1129 at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The crux of Prof Zhu’s opinion, put simply, is that the filing of a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund is merely done to protect the Plaintiff’s interest in the Qingdao Court. This lack of choice on the part of the Plaintiff to file the claim or risk the consequence of not being able to claim against the SJ Limitation Fund later cannot therefore be said to “submitting to jurisdiction”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On the assumption that Prof Chu is correct that both the Maritime Procedure Law and the CPC do not define what amounts to “submission to jurisdiction”, I see force in Prof Chu’s opinion, and accept that the Plaintiff, by participating in a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund set up by the Defendant, is, in and of itself, not submitting to the jurisdiction to the Qingdao Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The enquiry however does not end there. Filing a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund is but only one of the Four Concurrent Proceedings before the Qingdao Court. Unfortunately, Prof Chu’s opinion does not cover whether each of the three other concurrent proceedings amount to a “submission to jurisdiction”, and more crucially, whether the Four Concurrent Proceedings considered cumulatively would lead to the conclusion that the Plaintiff had indeed submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Indeed, one inference that may be drawn from the lack of any such analysis was that Prof Chu would have known that his opinion would be turned on its head when trying to explain the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim since the filing of the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim was on the Plaintiff’s own prerogative. I am therefore of the view Prof Chu’s opinion, similarly, cannot be fully relied upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As I have expressed doubts as to how Prof Chu and Prof Zhao have reached the conclusions they did, I make no finding on whether the Plaintiff had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. As highlighted earlier, whether a party submits to foreign jurisdiction is but one of the many factors to be considered and is not determinative in deciding whether there is some other available forum that is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate”. Hence, there is no need for me to make any specific finding on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Apart from being involved in the Four Concurrent Proceedings (and not filing any objections whatsoever to the constitution of the SJ Limitation Fund or the Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim despite having been given notice of the 187 Application and the said claim), what is clear from the evidence presented (which remain undisputed), is that the Plaintiff had participated in the proceedings in the Qingdao Court without any reservation of jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 18 April 2022, both the Plaintiff and the Defendant filed evidence in respect of the Collision for their Inter-Ship Claims;

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Furthermore, it is apposite to point out that the Plaintiff and NEPIA has set up its own limitation fund – the AS CLC Limitation Fund – to protect itself from third-party claims for oil spills. This shows that the Plaintiff was not merely participating in proceedings started by the Defendant, just so that they could put a stake on the SJ Limitation Fund; they had also set up their own limitation fund to protect their own interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 From the above, it is clear to me that both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were (and continue to be) willing for the Four Concurrent Proceedings to proceed full steam ahead. The proceedings in the PRC are more advanced than the proceedings in Singapore as both parties have constituted limitation funds in China, tendered evidence to the court on their respective claims, and made written and oral submissions as to the merit of their claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As (a) the PRC is the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>natural forum, (b) that legal proceedings have commenced by both parties in the Qingdao Court and are in a more advanced stage than proceedings in the Singapore Courts, and (c) that there would be a risk of multiplicity of proceedings which would offend the principle of international comity, I find that the Qingdao Court is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> a “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” forum for the case to be tried. The only connecting factor to Singapore was that the ship, the “Sea Justice”, was arrested within the jurisdiction of Singapore, which in my view, is insignificant compared to the three factors above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stage 2 Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The Plaintiff submitted that the juridical advantage they would lose if these proceedings are stayed in favour of proceedings in the Qingdao Court is the <span class="font-italic">security</span> in Singapore which was legally obtained, and not that they are able to claim a higher amount under Singapore’s limitation framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In my view, the practical effect of the Plaintiff losing the security it obtained is <span class="font-italic">no different</span> from losing the benefit of the higher limit that Singapore has to offer under her laws. This is because the security that was agreed upon by both parties for the release of the vessel was pegged to the maximum that the Plaintiff would be allowed to claim under Singapore’s limitation framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Further, at the hearing, the Plaintiff clarified that after the legal proceedings before the Qingdao Court are completed, they intend to come back to Singapore not to enforce the Qingdao Court’s judgment, but rather, to lift the stay of proceedings and apply to the Singapore court to issue a judgment in their favour on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel. This was, of course, on the assumption that the Qingdao Court finds that the Defendant was liable for the Collision. In doing so, the damages that can be obtained by the Plaintiff would correspondingly be subject to the limits which are applicable to the Singapore courts under the 1976 LLMC amended by the 1996 Protocol, which is higher than the limits applicable to the Qingdao Court under its own domestic laws. This way, the Plaintiff would effectively be allowed to enjoy the full extent of the Singapore limitation framework. It bears pointing out that at [37] of <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf, </span>Belinda Ang J (as she then was) foresaw such a situation and held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would be contrary to <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>principles to look favourably upon a party who selected a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">forum based solely upon the level of damages that could be awarded</span> or higher limits of liability.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Put plainly, the Plaintiff’s submission that it would lose the security it obtained from the Defendant if a stay is ordered is simply an attempt to sidestep the fact that the existence of different limitation regimes has previously been held not to be a personal or juridical advantage under Stage 2 on grounds of international comity (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [55]). Where a higher level of damages recoverable is the only reason for choosing Singapore as the forum for the claim, I cannot take this into consideration as a juridical advantage that the Plaintiff would lose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 If losing the security it had obtained is counted as a juridical advantage the Plaintiff stands to lose if this proceedings are stayed, this would inevitably force the Defendant to defend the claims in Singapore and to potentially set up a limitation fund in Singapore. This would be contrary to what the Court held in <span class="font-italic">Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd and Others</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 457 (“<span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span>”) at [47] that, “the right to claim limitation in any particular form is a right that belongs to the shipowner alone and that choice is not to be pre-empted by a claimant”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span>, a collision between “The Ever Glory” and the “Hual Trinita” happened in Singapore waters. The owner of “The Ever Glory” commenced a limitation action in Singapore under the 1957 LLMC (which was the applicable tonnage limitation regime then) and obtained a declaration that its liability was limited to approximately S$ 2.4m. The defendants, the owner or insurers of the cargo on board “Hual Trinita”, were aware that the limitation fund had been constituted but did not participate in the limitation action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Subsequently, a sister ship of “The Ever Glory” was arrested in Belgium and the defendants commenced an action against the plaintiff in Belgium. It was clear that the reason for doing so was because Belgium had ratified the 1976 LLMC, which provided for a higher limitation limit of S$13.5m. The plaintiff applied to the Singapore court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing their action in Belgium.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The court granted the anti-suit injunction and made two findings that are pertinent to the present case. First, the court held that a claimant cannot dictate where the limitation fund is to be constituted, and the defendants’ act of commencing proceedings against the plaintiff in Belgium is a means to frustrate or subvert the plaintiff’s choice of forum for pursuing a limitation action (see <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[47] to [49])<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>In coming to this finding, the court referred to <span class="font-italic">The Volvox Hollandia</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 361 (“<span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span>”) and affirmed its proposition that it would be wrong for a claimant to seek to usurp a shipowner’s choice of forum for his limitation action by seeking a negative declaration in the liability action to the effect that the shipowner is not entitled to limit (the “<span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span> principle”). The court held that, “where a higher limit is sought by the liability claimant like the defendants in contravention of the <span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span> principle, the court should not go to his assistance. The advantage of the 1976 Convention contended for by the defendants is not a legitimate consideration in the overall question of where the ends of justice lie” (see <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Second, the Court explained that once a limitation fund has been constituted, the defendants’ right to recover full compensation from the plaintiff is transformed into a right to payment of a proportionate amount of a limited fund, and the defendants are to share rateably with others in the amount of the owner’s limited liability available for distribution. <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory </span>(at [52])<span class="font-italic"> </span>states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 In Singapore, the decree of limitation conferred upon the plaintiffs a right to limit total liability. After the limitation fund is constituted, all claims arising out of the collision are to be brought against that fund. The defendants’ right to recover full compensation from the plaintiffs is transformed into a right to payment of a proportionate amount of a limited fund (see <span class="font-italic">The Happy Fellow</span>). The defendants are to share rateably with others in the amount of the owners’ limited liability available for distribution. In short, the plaintiffs are given a personal right to limit liability and protection from proceedings in rem after the decree is granted and the limitation fund constituted. It has been suggested in The Bowbelle [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 532 at 536 that the plaintiffs could enforce their rights by filing an appropriately worded caveat against arrest. The Belgium proceedings will alter those rights and obligations if the Singapore decree is not recognised. To that extent, the effect and consequence of the Belgium proceedings infringe or undermine the protection granted to the plaintiffs by the Singapore court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The Court held that if the defendants were allowed to commence proceedings against the plaintiff in Belgium, the defendants will obviate the need to share rateably with others in the amount of the plaintiffs’ limited liability available for distribution in Singapore, and this was obviously wrong,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[47] of <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span> is apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 The right to claim limitation in any particular forum is a right that belongs to the shipowner alone and that choice is not to be pre-empted by a claimant. <span class="font-weight-bold">In other words, a claimant cannot dictate where the limitation fund is to be constituted.</span> See <span class="font-italic">The Volvox Hollandia</span>. Rix J in <span class="font-italic">Caspian Basin Specialised Emergency Salvage </span><span class="font-italic">Administration v Bouygues Offshore SA (No 4)</span> with whom the Court of Appeal agreed with relied on <span class="font-italic">The Volvox Hollandia</span> for the proposition that it would be wrong for a claimant to seek to usurp a shipowner’s choice of forum for his limitation action by seeking a negative declaration in the liability action to the effect that the shipowner is not entitled to limit. <span class="font-weight-bold">In the same way, the effect and consequence of litigating in Belgium like the device of the negative declaration of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">non entitlement to limit is another means or way to frustrate or subvert the plaintiffs’ choice of forum for pursuing a limitation action.</span> It purports to dictate the limitation forum and that is wrong in law. It is hence oppressive as the plaintiffs are compelled or coerced through the institution and continuation of foreign proceedings to set up another limitation fund in this case in Belgium when there is already an existing and properly constituted limitation fund in Singapore. <span class="font-weight-bold">In addition, the defendants’ election to have limitation determined under Belgium law is not only inconsistent with the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> principle,</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">it</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> seeks to obviate the need to share rateably with others in the amount of the plaintiffs’ limited liability available for distribution in Singapore.</span> That is obviously wrong not only as between the plaintiffs and defendants but also as between the defendants and other claimants to the limitation fund.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> [Emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In my view, what the Plaintiff in the present case is attempting to do what the defendants in <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory </span>did when they arrested the plaintiff’s sister ship in Belgium and commenced legal proceedings there so that they could enjoy a higher limitation limit. Litigating in Singapore is the Plaintiff’s way of frustrating the Defendant’s choice of pursing a limitation action in the Qingdao Court. Applying the principles espoused in <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span>, the Plaintiff should not be allowed to dictate where the limitation fund should be constituted, and the Court should not go to the assistance of the Plaintiff where a higher limit is sought, in contravention of the <span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span> principle. The Plaintiff should share rateably with others in the amount constituted by the SJ Limitation Fund. Allowing the proceedings in Singapore to continue will alter the rights and obligations of the SJ Limitation Fund and will undermine and infringe upon the protection granted to the Defendant in the Qingdao Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I wish to point out that the Court in <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span>, at [62], had also held that while the 1957 LLMC limit may well be a disadvantage to the defendants in Singapore, it cannot be properly termed an injustice.

Owners and/or demise charterers of the ships or vessels “Milano Bridge” and “CMA CGM Musca” and “CMA CGM Hydra”</span> [2022] HKCA 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Milano Bridge</span>”), the plaintiff tried to arrest the wrongdoing ship in Hong Kong, as they would benefit from a higher limitation figure as per Hong Kong’s legislation. This contrasted with the lower amount that they could claim in South Korea, where the tort occurred.  In granting a stay of proceedings, the HKCA found that there were public policy considerations on comity that militated towards doing so. It held that just because the competing jurisdiction as a lower limit does not mean that justice can never be found in the natural and more clearly appropriate forum. [61] of the court’s judgment is apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If this action is allowed to proceed for the reason of the advantage relied on, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it will be hard to imagine any case, where limitation has a significant impact, in which the Hong Kong court will not pronounce that justice is not obtainable in the natural and otherwise clearly more appropriate forum simply because that jurisdiction applies the unrevised 1976 Convention limit.</span> In my opinion that would not be an approach in keeping with comity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 While I may sympathise with the Plaintiff for being only able to claim a fraction of its damages in comparison to its estimated alleged loss under the SJ Limitation Fund, this is not unjust to either party since the Qingdao Court had deemed it just to retain a lower limitation and the merits of that legislation are not justiciable before this court (see <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Ship or Vessel Ming Galaxy v The Owners of the Ship or Vessel or Property Herceg Novi</span> [1998] SGHC 303). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I therefore find that the PRC is the more appropriate forum and the Singapore proceedings should be stayed in favour of the proceedings in the Qingdao Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Issue 2: Whether the warrant of arrest should be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In respect of the application to set aside the warrant of arrest, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had failed to disclose four material facts at the Duty Registrar hearing, i.e., when the Plaintiff applied for the warrant of arrest. These are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The failure to disclose that the Plaintiff had relied on an erroneous translation of its affidavit in relation to the Plaintiff’s reservation of its rights to submit to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court. The Plaintiff had misrepresented to the Duty Registrar that it had reserved its right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court by adding the non-existent phrase “or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law” in its in-house English translation of its application to the Qingdao Court to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund. This phrase was however never in the original Chinese language document and it was only after the Defendant highlighted the glaring mistranslation that the Plaintiff admitted the error. The Defendant assert that the misrepresentation the Plaintiff made was a deliberate attempt by the Plaintiff to portray to the Court that the Plaintiff has not accepted and/or submitted to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court even though it has registered its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund (“Material Fact 1”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The failure to disclose that the Plaintiff did not file any objection to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court within the statutory time limit (“Material Fact 2”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The failure to disclose that it had taken part in a Qingdao Court hearing which was related to the Inter-Ship Claims (“Material Fact 3”); and.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The failure to disclose that the AS CLC Limitation Fund had been constituted in the Qingdao Court, and that the Plaintiff had brought an indemnity claim against that fund in the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim (“Material Fact 4”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Plaintiff’s response to Material Fact 1 was that they made full and sufficient disclosure of the existence of the two Inter-Ship claims in its affidavit filed in support of the application for the warrant of arrest, and at the arrest hearing itself. The Plaintiff also took pains to point out, in its written submissions and at the hearings, that the translation error was innocent and inadvertent. They submitted that the translation error was due to the Plaintiff’s PRC solicitors having inadvertently provided their Singapore counsel with an outdated in-house translation of the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim, at the time when the application for a warrant of arrest in Singapore was filed.

In their view, only the fact that proceedings were commenced in the PRC, and what those proceedings are, were relevant to the Duty Registrar’s assessment. In any case, the Plaintiff’s solicitors had brought the attention of the Duty Registrar to the proceedings in the Qingdao Court, including the Qingdao Court hearing relating to the Inter-Ship Claims, and the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund. I pause here to highlight that having gone through the records, the Plaintiff’s solicitor did not allude to the Inter-Ship Clams and the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund at the hearing before the Duty Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on setting aside a warrant of arrest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 When applying for a warrant of arrest, the Plaintiff is under a duty to disclose to the court hearing that application all matters within their knowledge which might be material, even if it may be prejudicial to their claim (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> "Vasiliy Golovnin”</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin</span>”) at [83]).

The Plaintiff must draw the attention of the judge to the relevant papers, and it is not sufficient to produce exhibits which contain the papers if no specific reference is made to them; a failure to refer to material documents is a failure to disclose (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin</span> at [94]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 However, as restated in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Jeil Crystal”</span> [2021] SGHC 292 at [69] and [70], when the Court condemns material non-disclosure by setting aside the warrant of arrest obtained <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span>, it is doing so in the public interest to discourage the abuse of the procedure.

This is because the reservation of rights, without the Missing Words, allowed the Plaintiff to raise a “procedural defence”. According to Prof Chu, the Plaintiff may challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court and choose not to submit to it by making a “procedural defence” under Chinese law.

</div> Prof Chu made two further points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 First, even if an express reservation of jurisdiction was included in the Plaintiff’s application to register its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund, it remains unclear under Chinese procedural law what legal effect that has on the exclusion of a foreign court from exercising jurisdiction based on its own laws.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As a starting point, whether the Plaintiff raised the issue of a reservation of rights when it registered its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund is relevant when considering granting a warrant of arrest. The reservation of rights signals to both the Qingdao Court and the Singapore court that the Plaintiff is intent to proceed with the legal action in the Singapore court and not the Qingdao Court. The fact that the Plaintiff had participated in the legal proceedings commenced in the Qingdao Court without any express reservation or objection to the Qingdao Court’s jurisdiction is therefore inconsistent with what the Plaintiff told the Court during the warrant of arrest application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Further, I note that by 19 October 2022 (which was when the application for a warrant of arrest was made), apart from the fact that the SJ Limitation Fund had been constituted and that the Plaintiff had registered its claim against the Fund, other proceedings in the Qingdao Court have also by then commenced and they are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Inter-Ship Claims on liability had been filed by both parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) NEPIA had filed, and the Qingdao Court had approved, for a limitation fund to be set up to protect the Plaintiff from 3rd party claims (Material Fact 4);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) parties have filed their evidence in relation to their respective Inter-Ship Claims (Material Fact 3); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s lawyers had conferred on the evidence tendered by the parties and jointly confirmed in writing to the Qingdao Court on the authenticity of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 For reasons only known to the Plaintiff, these were not disclosed to the Duty Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The picture that was painted to the Duty Registrar was that (a) a SJ Limitation Fund was set up in the Qingdao Court, (b) the Plaintiff has registered its claims against the said fund albeit with a reservation of rights, and (c) the Defendant’s ASI Application was rejected, and therefore the Plaintiff can continue with proceedings commenced in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 This was somewhat different from what had transpired in reality, i.e. that the Plaintiff did not object to the jurisdiction to the Qingdao Court in not one but four applications, and that proceedings in the Qingdao Court had begun and progress more than just the fact that the SJ Limitation Fund had been constituted and the Plaintiff registering their claims against the said fund had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 While I was not entirely convinced with the Plaintiff’s argument that the application should still be construed as one which was made with a strict reservation of rights as to jurisdiction even without the Missing Words (since no reasons were proffered to explain why the Missing Word had to be included in the first place if that was the case), the Defendant had offered no expert opinion to rebut the Prof Chu’s opinion on this. Accordingly, the court only has Prof Chu’s opinion to rely on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Since it was still possible, in substance, for the Plaintiff not to submit to the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court under Chinese law by challenging its jurisdiction by making a “procedural defence”, and that the Plaintiff did draw the Duty Registrar’s attention to fact that the Defendant’s ASI Application was denied by the Qingdao Court, I find that the lack of the Missing Words in the reservation of rights clause was, in the overall circumstance, not material to the granting of the warrant of arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As alluded to above, the Court always retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside a warrant of arrest (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Fierbinti</span> at [41]). In exercising this discretion, the Court often applies the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of such default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The “sin” in the present case is the limited extent of the disclosure made by the arresting solicitor at the hearing before the Duty Registrar. In my view, every proceeding before the Qingdao Court preceding the hearing before the Duty Registrar should have been disclosed. That said, the impact of not disclosing more was not significant considering that the Plaintiff would still be able to challenge the jurisdiction of the Qingdao Court even if it did not expressly reserve its rights on jurisdiction. I therefore exercise my discretion not to set aside the warrant of arrest. For completeness, I note that a reservation of rights on jurisdiction is not the same as a rejection of jurisdiction. Had the Plaintiff stated on its affidavit accompanying the application for the warrant of arrest that it had rejected the Qingdao Court’s jurisdiction even though it applied to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund, the outcome would have been different.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the security should be returned to the Defendant </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As I have decided not to set aside the warrant of arrest, it remains for me to determine whether (a) the two partial securities furnished to the Plaintiff in exchange for the release of the “Sea Justice” should be returned to the Defendant, and (b) in the alternative, the Court should grant a case management stay or a conditional stay on the terms proposed by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Security should be returned to the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In my judgment, granting the Stay Application necessarily requires that the security should be returned to the Defendant, as there would no longer be a basis for maintaining the security in Singapore without a pending claim against the Defendant in this jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As a starting point, the UK Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Putbus”</span> [1969] P 136 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Putbus</span>”) ruled that a shipowner, having limited his liability by constituting a limitation fund to answer collision claims, should not be compelled to put up further security in another country for the same collision claims. The following extract at 149E is apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“…If a ship is involved in a collision in circumstances to which the owner is entitled to limit his liability, then he should only be compelled to provide a limitation fund once and for all. If he makes it available in one country to meet all the limited claims, he should not be compelled to put up security for those claims in another country: or if he is compelled to do so, he should be able to get the additional security released…”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 This is consistent with the position in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span>, the court endorsed the starting position that a limitation decree not set aside is good against the world (at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sheen J in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Falstria</span> [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 495 at 497 explained that “[t]he essence of a limitation action is that the plaintiffs in that action seek a decree, which is valid against all possible claimants, that a limit is set upon the eventual liability of the plaintiffs to all those claimants.” <span class="font-weight-bold">A limitation decree not set aside, as was the case here, is good against the world</span>: See <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Volvox Hollandia</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 361; <span class="font-italic">The Happy Fellow</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In the present case, the SJ Limitation Fund has not been set aside and is good against the world. Further, as I had explained above (at [117]–[120]), the Defendant retains the inalienable right to choose the forum to limit its liability. To allow the security to be retained in Singapore is to allow the Plaintiff to usurp the Defendant’s choice of forum for its limitation action. As such, upon the Stay Application being granted, the security ought to be returned to the Defendant in full. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A case management stay or conditional stay should not be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The Plaintiff had suggested a form of a case management stay or a conditional stay to be imposed should this Court take the view that the issue of liability and damages should dealt with by the Qingdao Court. I disagree. Ordering a case management stay or conditional stay is, in substance, allowing the Plaintiff to be doubly secured, which goes against international comity and should not be allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, specifically where the court there held that a plaintiff should not be deprived the benefit of security in a country, even though proceedings should be stayed on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens, </span>to do “practical justice” by the plaintiff. In my view, <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>can be distinguished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Lord Goff of Chieveley was writing in <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta, </span>and in any case, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>showed that the tide has turned against this “practical justice” approach. Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>at [37] noted the turn from judicial chauvinism towards judicial comity, which based on the force of case law and public policy, should prevail in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Even though the Plaintiff has argued at lengths that there is no double security as the SJ Limitation Fund in the PRC was constituted pursuant to a domestic decree, respectfully, that argument misses the point. To allow the security to subsist in Singapore would effectively allow the Plaintiff to be doubly secured in Singapore and the PRC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Similar to what I explained above (at [118]) regarding <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory </span>and <span class="font-italic">The Bramley Moore, </span>allowing the Plaintiff to maintain its security in Singapore and claim against it at a later date would go against considerations of comity. By ordering that security be maintained here, it would be tantamount to making a finding that the legislative provisions in the PRC – which it had every sovereign entitlement to enact – were inadequate in comparison with our local legislation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 This is the exact situation that <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>foresaw, and the court very prudently closed the door on such situations (see <span class="font-italic">The Ever Glory</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62]). Quoting the decision of GP Selvam J in <span class="font-italic">The Herceg Novi</span> (unreported decision dated 10 September 1998 in Admiralty in Rem No. 514 of 1996) with approval, the Court cannot stay an action legitimately brought before it on the ground that there is “<span class="font-italic">something wanting in its system of justice and that better justice will be done in another jurisdiction</span>”<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Applying this to the present case, where the PRC legislature had deemed it just to impose a regime that provided for a lower limitation as compared to Singapore, the Singapore court must give effect to that legislation. The merits of that legislation cannot be justiciable before this court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Indemnity for oil pollution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 For completeness, the Plaintiff argued that it is unclear whether indemnity for oil pollution, which makes up the bulk of their claim in damages against the Defendant, should fall within the limitation fund. They submit that if it does not, they should be allowed to come to Singapore to claim against the local security for this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Again, the issue is whether the Plaintiff would be doubly secured. In my view, they would be, and this should not be allowed. Furthermore, they have not discharged their burden of proving that these claims are not subject to the SJ Limitation Fund in the PRC; their argument, without the requisite evidence, was speculative at best. In any case, they have already registered this claim against the SJ Limitation Fund.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In conclusion, as (a) the PRC is the natural forum, (b) that legal proceedings have commenced by both parties in the Qingdao Court and are in a more advanced stage than proceedings in the Singapore Courts which include the constitution of two limitation funds, (c) that there would be a risk of multiplicity of proceedings which would offend the principle of international comity since parties remain resolute in litigating their claims filed before the Qingdao Court, and (d) that the Plaintiff having to return the security is not a juridical advantage it would lose, I find that the Qingdao Court is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” a forum for this case to be tried. I therefore order that the present proceedings be stayed unconditionally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Further, as I have also found that the non-disclosures by the Plaintiff were, although relevant, were immaterial, I dismiss the Defendant’s application to set aside the warrant of arrest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Finally, I am of the view that the security should be returned to the Defendant in full and that no case management stay in the terms proposed by the Plaintiff ought to be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 It leaves me to thank counsel from both sides for their arduous work, both written and oral, from which I greatly benefitted from.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Nicholas Lai </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Timothy Tan, Gho Sze Kee and Liao Yanting (AsiaLegal LLC) for the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Xue Ting, C Sivah and Loh Wai Yue (Incisive Law LLC) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
