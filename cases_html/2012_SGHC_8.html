        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This dispute revolved around the operation of
                    the tenancy by Takashimaya department store of its current premises at Ngee Ann
                    City, Orchard Road, Singapore. The holding company of Takashimaya is Toshin
                    Development Singapore Pte Ltd (“the defendant”). The rent payable
                    under the terms set out in the lease in question was subject to review pursuant
                    to a particular rent review mechanism. HSBC Institutional Trust Services
                    (Singapore) Ltd (“the plaintiff/lessor”) on behalf of Starhill
                    Global Real Estate Investment Trust alleged that the defendant/lessee had acted
                    in such a manner as to render the rent review mechanism inoperable. The
                    plaintiff filed Originating Summons No. 376 of 2011 (“the
                    Originating Summons”) on 13 May 2011 for declarations that the rent
                    review mechanism was inoperable, that this was so because of the
                    defendant’s action; and prayed for an order that there be an inquiry as to
                    the prevailing market rental value of Takashimaya’s
                premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing lengthy arguments from the
                    parties, I dismissed the plaintiff’s application on 2 September 2011.
                    As the plaintiff has appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No.108 of
                    2011), I now set out my grounds for dismissing its application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a locally incorporated company
                    and is the trustee of Starhill Global Real Estate Investment Trust (SG REIT). SG
                    REIT has an interest in the building known as Ngee Ann City, situated at
                    No. 391 Orchard Road, Singapore where Takashimaya is located. SG REIT is
                    managed by a company known as YTL Starhill Global REIT Management Limited
                    (“YSGRM”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant is also a Singapore company and is
                    in the business of developing and managing shopping centres. It is a wholly
                    owned subsidiary of Toshin Development Co Ltd (Toshin Japan), a Japanese company
                    which is in turn part of the Takashimaya group based in Japan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At issue between the plaintiff and defendant was
                    the operation of a lease of premises Lot No U5785V of Town Subdivision 21 at
                    Ngee Ann City (“the Premises”). In 1993, Toshin Japan leased the
                    Premises from a company known as Orchard Square Properties Private Limited. In
                    2005, Orchard Square Properties assigned its interest in the lease to the
                    plaintiff, and in 2010, Toshin Japan transferred its interest in the lease to
                    the defendant. As it stands, the plaintiff is the current lessor and the
                    defendant the current lessee of the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The terms of the lease between the parties are
                    contained in Lease Instrument No IA/138539R as varied by Variation of Lease
                    Instrument No IA/139624V and Transfer Instrument No. IB/700860B. (The
                    various lease instruments will collectively be referred to as “the Lease
                    Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Lease Agreement was to endure for a period
                    of twenty years, commencing on 8 June 1993. These twenty years were divided
                    into several Rental Terms, each lasting for a successive period of three years,
                    except for the final Rental Term which would last for two years. Pursuant to
                    cl 2.4 of the Lease Agreement, the amount of rent payable by the defendant
                    to the plaintiff for the rental of the Premises was subject to review every
                    three years for each new forthcoming Rental Term. The amount of rent for the
                    Rental Term immediately preceding the rent review exercise was referred to as
                    the “Current Annual Rent”, and the amount of rent for the
                    forthcoming Rental Term was referred to as the “New Annual
                    Rent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Clause 2.4 of the Lease Agreement set out the
                    three-step mechanism by which the amount of rent was to be reviewed. The steps
                    were structured as successive redundancies, such that it was only if the first
                    step failed that the second step would be engaged, and only if the second step
                    failed that the third step would be engaged as a last resort. The first step was
                    contained in cl 2.4(c)(i) which provided that: “the Lessor and the
                    Lessee shall in good faith endeavour to agree on the prevailing market rental
                    value of the [Premises]... for purpose(<em>sic</em>) of
                    determining the New Annual Rent for the relevant Rental
                Term.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Clause 2.4(c)(iv) clarified that the
                    “prevailing market rental value” would be adopted as the New
                    Annual Rent, subject to the conditions that (i) if this amount was less than the
                    Current Annual Rent, the latter value would prevail as the New Annual Rent and
                    (ii) that if this amount exceeded 125% of the Current Annual Rent, then the New
                    Annual Rent would be fixed at 125% of the Current Annual Rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     If no agreement was reached by three months
                    before commencement of the forthcoming Rental Term then the first step would
                    have failed and only then would the second and possibly the third steps be
                    engaged. This mechanism was set out in cl 2.4(c)(ii). Since the storm
                    clouds of controversy were largely gathered around this clause, it is necessary
                    to set it out in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If by three (3) months (time being of the essence) before commencement of
                        the relevant Rental Term the parties have not reached agreement on the New
                        Annual Rent, the parties shall appoint three international firms of licensed
                        valuers (the “licensed valuers”) on the basis that each of the
                        licensed valuers shall proceed to separately determine the prevailing market
                        rental value of the [Premises]. The licensed valuers shall be nominated by
                        agreement between the Lessor and the Lessee or in absence of agreement by
                        the parties on any one of the licensed valuers by a date ten (10) weeks
                        (time being of the essence) before commencement of the relevant Rental Term,
                        such of the licensed valuers as have not been agreed upon shall be nominated
                        by the President for the time being of the Singapore Institute of Surveyors
                        and Valuers... All costs and expenses of and in connection with the
                        appointment of the licensed valuers shall be borne by the Lessor and the
                        Lessee in equal shares. The licensed valuers shall act as experts and not as
                        arbitrators and their respective decisions shall be binding and conclusive
                        on the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     To briefly summarise, the first step
                    envisioned the lessor and lessee agreeing on the prevailing market rental value.
                    If they could not agree, then the second step required that they appoint three
                    valuers to identify this value. If they could not agree on the identities of the
                    valuers then the third step required that the President of the Singapore
                    Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV) appoint the valuers. Crucially, the
                    expenses involved in engaging these valuers no matter how appointed, were to be
                    borne equally by the lessor and the lessee; this meant that the valuers were to
                    be <em>jointly appointed</em> by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     A New Rental Term for the Premises was
                    scheduled to commence on 8 June 2011; in the months before this date, the
                    parties sought to conduct the rent review exercise beginning negotiations
                    sometime in January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The point of contention between the plaintiff
                    and defendant centered on the second and third steps of the mechanism. These
                    steps involved valuers drawn from international firms of licensed valuers, of
                    which only eight such firms in Singapore could qualify. The plaintiff claimed
                    that the defendant had acted in such a manner as to render the second and third
                    steps inoperable, by unilaterally hiring seven out of the eight firms to conduct
                    a valuation of the Premises for the defendant’s own purposes over a period
                    stretching from July 2010 to February 2011, before the joint conduct of the rent
                    review exercise by the parties for the New Rental Term commencing on 8 June
                    2011. It should also be noted that the defendant had actually approached the
                    eighth firm, Savills (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Savills”) but Savills
                    had declined engagement by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The reliefs claimed by the plaintiff in the
                    Originating Summons consisted of first, a declaration that the rent review
                    mechanism had been rendered inoperable; second, a declaration that the
                    defendant’s actions in unilaterally engaging seven of the eight valuation
                    firms had rendered the mechanism inoperable; and third, an order that there be
                    an inquiry as to the prevailing market rental value of the Premises with this
                    court to issue directions as to the proper conduct of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff’s basis for its claim
                    started off with a resolute allegation that if any of the seven valuers that had
                    been engaged by the defendant were to participate in the rent review exercise,
                    then their findings would be tainted by conflicts of interest. As the
                    proceedings progressed, the precise basis of the plaintiff’s claim wavered
                    from an allegation of a conflict of interest to allegations of bias and improper
                    influence. Notwithstanding the uncertain nature of the plaintiff’s
                    unhappiness, it was clear that the plaintiff sought to convince this court that
                    something was not proper about the defendant’s behaviour in unilaterally
                    engaging seven out of the eight qualifying valuers, with these same valuers
                    being potentially involved in a rent review exercise that was due to commence
                    soon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Counsel for the plaintiff Ang Cheng Hock
                    (“Mr Ang”) submitted four arguments at the hearing on
                    29 August 2011 in support of the plaintiff’s claim. First, that
                    appointed valuers must act independently and impartially. Mr Ang submitted
                    that it was implied in cl 2.4(c)(ii) that the valuers were not expert
                    witnesses, but someone who had to make a rental determination that would bind
                    the parties. Second, that the valuers would want to abide by their previous
                    valuations. Third, that the defendant might have disclosed certain information
                    to the valuers which the plaintiff would not be aware of. Fourth, that the
                    defendant’s conduct suggested that they would know in advance which
                    valuers would provide low valuations of the prevailing market rental value.
                    Since this was to its advantage, the defendant could then support the
                    appointment of these valuers during the joint rent review
                exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Two concerns seemed to emerge from
                    plaintiff’s counsel’s above submissions. The first and second
                    arguments advanced gave the impression that the plaintiff was, firstly,
                    concerned that the findings of the valuers in the rent review exercise would to
                    some measure be tainted by conflicts of interest or bias. The third and fourth
                    arguments seemed to indicate that the plaintiff was, secondly, concerned that
                    the defendant would have obtained some form of advantage in the rent review
                    exercise which was to the plaintiff’s detriment. The defendant’s
                    responses to these concerns will be set out later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Before delineating the issues to be resolved
                    in this matter, it might be worthwhile pausing here to consider the nature of
                    the plaintiff’s claim. Although this was not stated in so many words in
                    the plaintiff’s submissions, the plaintiff’s claim appeared to
                    really be one about breach of contract, in that the defendant had acted in such
                    a way that the contract embodied in the Lease Agreement could no longer be
                    performed according to its terms. The plaintiff had also alleged that the
                    defendant should not be allowed to act in a manner that would result in the
                    frustration of the purpose of the contract<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Yet the
                    plaintiff seemed to have envisioned the Lease Agreement subsisting by simply
                    asked for declaratory reliefs and that the court order an inquiry into the
                    market rental value of the Premises. In substance, the latter remedy would
                    amount to the court substituting its own terms for those in the Lease Agreement,
                    which was a contract made between the parties. I had my reservations about the
                    legitimacy of this remedy, but decided to postpone my consideration of this
                    until after the merits of the case had been fully canvassed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Two issues needed to be resolved before I was
                    able to come to a decision on the overarching issue of whether the rent review
                    mechanism in the Lease Agreement had indeed been rendered inoperable as the
                    plaintiff claimed. The first issue was whether the independence of the valuers
                    in the rent review exercise would be compromised. This issue would encompass
                    considerations of conflicts of interest and bias whether apparent or actual.
                    Although the plaintiff had also alleged improper influence, the allegations in
                    my view were not substantiated and seemed to merely be a gloss on the conflicts
                    of interest and bias allegations. The second issue was whether the defendant
                    would stand to gain any unfair advantage in the rent review exercise as a result
                    of its 2010 engagement of seven out of the eight potential
                valuers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would the independence of the valuers in the rent review exercise be
                compromised?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     To some extent, the sub-issues of conflicts of
                    interest, bias and improper influence merge and conflate into one another. For
                    example, if as the plaintiff claimed, a valuer was suffering from a conflict of
                    interest, this could be a result of the valuer labouring under an improper
                    influence from his relationship with the defendant which end result would be
                    that the valuer would be biased toward the defendant. The discussion can be
                    crystallised to the inquiry on whether the valuer’s independence for the
                    forthcoming rent review exercise would be compromised; with the sub-issues
                    merely its facets. However, the plaintiff had alleged that it was important for
                    the valuers to avoid the <em>appearance</em> of bias when
                    engaged in the forthcoming rent review exercise. For this reason, it is
                    necessary to distill the issue of bias from the overall discussion in order to
                    ascertain how allegations of <em>apparent</em> and/or
                        <em>actual</em> bias will affect the overall
                    determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conflicts of interest </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At its most basic, a conflicts of interest
                    situation would arise when a person is under a duty to act in a party’s
                    interests; while that duty subsists, that person acts in such a manner as to
                    favour another party’s interests over the first party. The conflicting
                    interests could be those of a third party, or of the person himself. A potential
                    conflicts of interest situation would arise when the person is merely tempted to
                    act so as to favour another party’s interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff’s case was that the
                    valuers would owe duties to both parties jointly if they were engaged for the
                    forthcoming rent review exercise, notwithstanding that the parties’
                    interests in the rent review exercise would not be aligned with each
                    other’s. The conflict stemmed from the fact that, as claimed by the
                    plaintiff, during the rent review exercise, the valuers would also owe the
                    defendant a duty as a result of their prior engagement. The duty owed by the
                    valuers to the defendant would arise because valuers as professionals owed their
                    clients a duty of care when conducting a valuation for the latter. If the
                    valuers were engaged to conduct a second valuation of the same scope in the
                    future, the valuers would have an interest in adhering to the values they had
                    produced during the first valuation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is plain from the above paragraph that the
                    conflict alleged was between the duty owed by the valuers to the defendant that
                    subsisted from the previous valuation, and the duties owed by the valuers
                    jointly to the parties during the forthcoming rent review exercise. It seemed
                    clear enough that the scope of the previous engagement and the rent review
                    exercise were very similar in that both involved valuations of the Premises for
                    the purposes of ascertaining its rental value. The foundation stone of the
                    plaintiff’s argument was its claim that the valuers would continue to owe
                    a duty to the defendant singly during the rent review exercise, where this duty
                    would have subsisted from the previous engagement by the defendant. Without this
                    duty, there would be no conflict in the duties owed to the parties during the
                    rent review exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In support of its argument, the plaintiff
                    relied on the case of <em>Nugent v Benfield </em><em>Greig Group plc</em> [2002] 1 BCLC 65 (“<em>Nugent</em>”) for the proposition that professional
                    valuers would be bound by previous valuations conducted for their clients. In
                        <em>Nugent</em>, the valuers were tasked with valuing
                    shares that had been held by a director of a company before he was killed in a
                    helicopter crash in 1996. His shareholding passed to his executors, and the
                    company’s articles required that the shares be offered to other
                    shareholders of a company at a price to be valued by auditors. It came to light
                    that the same firm of auditors appointed for this purpose in 1999 had previously
                    been engaged by the same company in 1998 to value its shares with the direction
                    that the valuation should be as low as possible for tax purposes; and also in
                    1997 to value the same deceased director’s shares for the purposes of
                    assisting the remaining directors of the company in determining their approach
                    in respect of those shares. The plaintiff executors brought an action against
                    the defendant company pursuant to s 459(1) of the United Kingdom Companies
                    Act 1985 alleging unfair prejudice; the defendant company applied for summary
                    judgment against the plaintiff alleging that the plaintiff’s claim stood
                    no real prospect of success. Under those circumstances, Aldous LJ delivering the
                    judgment of the English Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant’s
                    application and held that there was a reasonable argument that the plaintiff had
                    been unfairly prejudiced. The auditor’s independence had been compromised
                    because it was restricted in their appointment as valuer “by the advice
                    that they had [previously] given in very different circumstances”; and
                    furthermore it had advised the defendant on a matter which was presently in
                    dispute between the plaintiff and defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the defendant, Cavinder Bull
                    (“Mr Cavinder”) responded that <em>Nugent</em> could be distinguished from the present case because in
                        <em>Nugent</em> the auditor had been engaged for the
                    purpose of providing a valuation of the shares that was as low as possible, but
                    in the present case the defendant’s previous engagement of the valuers was
                    to provide a fair and accurate valuation of the market rental value<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Thus, while the auditors in <em>Nugent</em> would have to contradict themselves in the later
                    valuation of the shares for market value, this consideration would not apply
                    here since both the 2010 valuations and the rent review exercise would be
                    undertaken to ascertain market value. Mr Cavinder went on to say that the
                    rent review exercise would not have required the valuers to value the Premises
                    under very different circumstances as was the case in <em>Nugent</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     However, it seemed to me that Aldous
                    LJ’s reasons in <em>Nugent</em> were slightly
                    different. At [32] of the judgment, the
                    learned judge held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It followed that by the time of the 1999 offer round, [the company] knew
                        that [the auditor] had put their name to a report valuing an ordinary share
                        at [a low value]. It is therefore arguable that they must have known that
                        despite the purposes of the previous request, namely that the valuation was
                        for the purposes of reporting to the Inland Revenue, it was unlikely that
                        they would say that the value placed on the shares was wrong or was valued
                        on a wrong basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Of greater concern to Aldous LJ was the
                    auditors’ professional unwillingness to depart from the valuations which
                    they had made earlier, notwithstanding the purposes for which they were made.
                    This priority of concerns must be right. The purposes for which a valuation is
                    done can be hard to define and discern, and even if the direction given to the
                    valuers is supposedly clear, the understanding of this direction can be modified
                    by the context in which the valuation is done and the valuer’s own
                    standards and assumptions. It does not seem wise to ascertain if a potential
                    conflict of interest could arise on the basis of amorphous
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This much was clear on the facts of this case.
                    Mr Cavinder submitted that the 2010 valuations were done on a “best
                    rent” basis<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> but later in the defendant’s
                    Supplementary Submissions it was submitted that the valuers were engaged in 2010
                    valuations to provide “fair and accurate” valuations<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Of course the descriptions
                    “best” and “fair and accurate” are not exclusive of
                    one another, but the subtle semantic differences could be difficult to evaluate
                    if we needed to ascertain the purposes of the valuations to decide if there was
                    a potential conflict of interest or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The 2010 valuation reports themselves appeared
                    to disclose different understandings of the concept of “market rental
                    value”. On 9 May 2011, the Managing Director of the defendant,
                    Kiyoshi Takehara, sent a letter to SG REIT enclosing five of the 2010 valuation
                    reports with the defendant’s confidential information redacted. Perusing
                    the reports, it is noted that four of the reports, namely those from DTZ
                    Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, Chesterton Suntec
                    International Pte Ltd (“Chesterton”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>,
                    Cushman and Wakefield (“Cushman”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and
                    Knight Frank Pte Ltd (“Knight Frank”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> all
                    understood market rental value to mean the “best rent” which could
                    reasonably be expected to be obtained for the Premises. In contrast, the report
                    from Colliers International Consultancy and Valuation (S) Pte Ltd
                        (“Colliers”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    understood market rental value to mean the rent which the Premises might
                    “reasonably be expected” to fetch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The defendant’s objectives in engaging
                    valuers for the 2010 valuation included the need to plan the defendant’s
                    business operations for the future, including negotiations with its sub-tenants
                    on rental rates; and also the need for the Takashimaya group which was publicly
                    listed in Japan, to prepare reports for its shareholders. The former objective
                    is significant – if the defendant had engaged the valuers to assist in its
                    negotiations with its sub-tenants, then the defendant would have been
                    approaching the 2010 valuations from the point of view of a sub-landlord, in
                    diametric contrast to the 2011 rent review exercise where the defendant would be
                    in the position of a tenant. The concept of “best rent” could mean
                    two very different things, depending on whether it was the landlord or the
                    tenant asking for the definition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The discussion above serves to underscore the
                    point that it is difficult to disclaim a conflict of interest simply because the
                    ostensible purposes of the valuations were different. The purposes may be
                    defined ambiguously or may be understood differently by different valuers, and
                    the context in which the valuations were undertaken could modify the purposes of
                    the valuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Returning to the case of <em>Nugent</em>, I was not convinced that it could stand for the
                    proposition that professional valuers would be bound by previous valuations
                    conducted for their clients. One line in <em>Nugent</em>
                    which the plaintiff relied heavily upon (at [37] of the judgment) was where Aldous LJ stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[the auditors] could not reasonably approach the task of valuer without
                        restrictions imposed by the advice that they had given in very different
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I accept that the “very different
                    circumstances” referred to the auditors’ previous instructions to
                    obtain a low valuation for the shares. But the restrictions imposed by that
                    advice referred to the auditors’ own professional unwillingness to depart
                    from their previous low valuation. I could not see how the
                    “restrictions” referred to any sort of duty on the part of the
                    auditors that subsisted beyond the submission of the earlier valuation report.
                    Professional valuers owe their clients a duty to conduct the valuation in a
                    professional manner, but once the valuation has been completed, then it seems to
                    me that the task has been performed and the situation is cut and dried. Valuers
                    do not warrant the quality of their valuations beyond the date of valuation, and
                    there is no reason why the valuers’ duty to their client should be
                    rehydrated and reconstituted beyond the valuation date. Perhaps an exception to
                    this would be where the client has engaged the valuer for a continuing series of
                    valuations, but this was not the case here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     If the valuers’ professional shackles
                    could be released, then there would be no reason to be concerned about a
                    conflict of interest. This would easily be achieved by jointly appointing the
                    valuers and issuing directions to them upon their appointment that they should
                    be independent and would not be bound by any previous valuations conducted at
                    any time in the past for either party. Indeed, this was the suggestion put
                    forward by Takehara of the defendant in his letter of 9 May 2011 to the
                        plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, and I find it an eminently sensible one. If
                    the defendant itself issued directions that the valuers are not liable to suit
                    by the defendant on the basis of their previous valuations, then there would be
                    no argument that the valuers were beholden to the defendant by any sort of
                    residual duty. The plaintiff’s claim that the defendant’s actions
                    were designed to bind the valuers to their previous valuations in anticipation
                    of the forthcoming rent review exercise<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> cannot
                    therefore stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I note the plaintiff’s objection to the
                    above suggestion, in that the suggestion was only put forward by the defendant
                        <em>after</em> the plaintiff had discovered that the
                    valuers were previously engaged by the defendant. The plaintiff claimed that if
                    it had not discovered the previous engagements, than the defendant would not
                    have made such a suggestion<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.
                    However, even if this was true, and even if the 2011 rent review exercise had
                    been carried out without the plaintiff’s knowledge of the
                    defendant’s previous engagements of the valuers, it would be most peculiar
                    if the defendant was to then sue the valuers for not adhering to their previous
                    2010 valuations. The mere whiff of such a suit would suffice for the plaintiff
                    to itself bring an action to disclaim the 2011 rent review exercise results on
                    the basis of actual bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For completeness, I should point out another
                    dimension of the conflicts of interests issue, which is the possibility that the
                    valuers’ own interests in future engagements from the defendant and
                    consequential financial gain would conflict with the plaintiff’s
                    interests. But this was not alleged by the plaintiff, and it is not for this
                    court to speculate that the valuers as reputable professionals would conduct
                    their business in such an unprofessional and/or unbecoming manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To lay the parties’ cases on the table
                    very simply, the plaintiff sought to draw an analogy between this case and cases
                    involving judicial determinations, and presented several cases to support its
                    proposition that decisions of an independent expert can be impeached on the
                    basis of perceived bias. Applied to the facts of the case, the plaintiff
                    submitted that the alleged conflict of interest would create an appearance of
                    partiality which tainted the seven valuers and was a ground for rendering the
                    rent review mechanism unworkable. In response, the defendant argued that the
                    valuers would be acting as experts in the rent review exercise, not
                    adjudicators; thus, actual bias rather than apparent bias should be established
                    in order to exclude an expert’s decision. The defendant submitted that
                    actual bias had not been established on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff also relied on a letter from the
                    Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (“SISV”) addressed to
                    the plaintiff dated 4 April 2011 This letter was written in response to a
                    letter dated 16 March 2011 written by Chong Thoon Shin of the plaintiff to
                    SISV, requesting SISV’s opinion on whether CB Richard Ellis
                    (“CBRE”), one of the valuation firms, should be excluded from the
                    2011 rent review exercise on the basis that CBRE had conducted a rental
                    valuation of the same premises in 2010 and because of this, that there could
                    potentially be a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     SISV’s response was that valuers to be
                    jointly appointed by the parties should be <em>perceived</em> as fair and equitable and that any firm that undertook
                    a rental valuation of the Premises before the rent review exercise should not be
                    included for the purposes of the rent review exercise. The plaintiff relied on
                    this as support for its submission that perceived bias was a relevant
                    consideration. With respect, SISV’s opinion was not very useful in the
                    light of the discussion to follow. Further, this opinion was sought without the
                    knowledge, let alone consent, of the defendant. Therefore, there was no reason
                    for the defendant to be bound by it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The realm of bias allegations is a veritable
                    minefield. The parties’ submissions appeared to invite me to make two
                    determinations: first, whether the valuers would be acting as experts or
                    adjudicators; and second, whether apparent bias suffices to cast doubt on the
                    independence of the valuers or whether actual bias must be shown. The issue may
                    not be as plainly dichotomised as that; indeed the issue of bias is in fact very
                    much tied up with the issue of conflicts of interest as the plaintiff’s
                    case suggested. At its simplest, the plaintiff’s allegation of bias meant
                    that the valuers acted (or in this case, if appointed, would act) such as to
                    favour the defendant in the rent review mechanism. While the reasons for such
                    favouritism can be manifold, the logical premise is that the valuers would have
                    acted with partiality because they had an interest in the outcome of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As to whether the valuers would be acting as
                    experts or adjudicators, the Lease Agreement made it clear. Clause 2.4(c)(ii) of
                    the Agreement states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The licensed valuers shall act as experts and not as arbitrators and their
                        respective decisions shall be binding and conclusive on the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This however, may not be the end of the
                    inquiry because the context in which the valuers operated suggested that there
                    was a dimension of dispute resolution to the matter. The valuers would only be
                    relevant at the second step of the rent review mechanism in cl 2.4(c)(ii),
                    which states that the valuers would only be called in to assist if the parties
                    were unable to agree on the prevailing market rental value. The valuers would
                    thus be engaged in the context of a dispute, in order to determine the very
                    thing which the parties could not agree on. Furthermore, the parties had agreed
                    to be bound by the valuers’ determinations, and the valuers’
                    determinations would decide on their substantive rights, <em>viz</em> the amount of rent that the defendant would pay and the
                    plaintiff would receive for the next three years, both of which were
                    characteristic of adjudicative behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On the other hand, there were also factors
                    apart from cl 2.4(c)(ii) pointing away from the valuers acting as dispute
                    resolvers. The valuers in creating a valuation would be undertaking
                    substantially the same exercise as they would be in a situation where there was
                    no dispute. A valuation of market rental value can be requested unilaterally by
                    one party, and there is no need for a dispute to force the determination of this
                    issue. Additionally, valuers arrive at valuations by taking into account various
                    considerations which are removed from the merits of the parties’ cases,
                    such as the location of the property, its condition <em>etc</em>, rather than making decisions based on the parties’
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     There would be little point in weighing the
                    various factors above to make a determination of whether the valuers in this
                    case were experts or adjudicators and in any event analogies are only useful up
                    to the point when they differ. A valuer is not a judicial actor, and to compare
                    him to one would be misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I can accept that the valuers appointed as
                    experts in the context of the rent review mechanism, should be independent and
                    cannot be biased, but I am not sure how much further beyond that I can
                    go.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Taking the plaintiff’s case at its
                    highest, that an allegation of perceived or apparent bias is sufficient to
                    impeach a valuer’s determination, I still found very little to convince me
                    of its merit. In the first place, the concept of apparent bias serves to protect
                    public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of a legal system.
                    Otherwise, as Andrew Phang JC stated in <em>Tang Kin Hwa v
                        Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 604, “all that is noble and fine which undergirds the
                    law will be tarnished and destroyed.” This was echoed in <em>Metropolitan Properties Co (F.G.C.) Lt v Lannon and ors</em>
                    [1968] 3 WLR 694 which the plaintiff relied on in support of its case.
                    At 707H, Lord Denning held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Justice must be rooted in confidence: and confidence is destroyed when
                        right-minded people go away thinking: “The judge was
                        biased.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It goes without saying that apparent bias can
                    impeach decisions of the judiciary. The same is also true for other tribunals
                    such as industrial, administrative or professional tribunals and arbitrators.
                    Tribunals and arbitrators both form parts of their own quasi-legal systems in
                    that there is some form of continuity and organisation in the circumstances they
                    operate in. Tribunals might be susceptible to judicial review, and
                    arbitrators’ awards are fortified by various domestic regimes and
                    international treaties. The point to note is that these constitute systems in
                    which the public confidence in the operation of the system needs to be protected
                    if the system is to continue to be relied upon. Putting things into perspective,
                    the valuers in the present case are appointed on the basis of a contractual
                    agreement made between two parties, and the only persons who would participate
                    in this system are the very same two parties who made the agreement.
                    Notwithstanding that the Lease Agreement was to endure for twenty years, it
                    would still be a little bit of a stretch to say that this mechanism constituted
                    a legal system in which public confidence was reposed in and should be
                    protected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I take the point that the parties were
                    companies which benefited from public participation. The plaintiff is the
                    trustee of a real estate investment trust and the defendant is a wholly owned
                    subsidiary of a Japanese public listed company. There are certainly some sectors
                    of the public which would be interested in the operation of the rent review
                    mechanism. However, that is not the same thing as saying that there is public
                    interest in maintaining public confidence in the rent review
                mechanism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     That said, even if we accept that the
                    principles of apparent or perceived bias should apply to the instant case and
                    even if we accept that apparent bias would be enough to impeach a valuer’s
                    determination, I am hard pressed to discern any apparent bias. I had opined at
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> that conflicts of interest in the
                    sense of the valuer being conflicted between the plaintiff’s and the
                    defendant’s interests are not an issue in this case. Further, the
                    possibility of financial interest in future remuneration from the defendant to
                    the valuers was not alleged in this case. There was no other allegation or
                    evidence of other interests which the valuers held. Under such circumstances I
                    am hard put to see what other interests the valuers could have in the outcome of
                    the case and why they would act with partiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I note that the test for apparent bias has
                    been variously stated as “reasonable suspicion” of bias and
                    “real likelihood” of bias<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. But I should make it clear that I had not even
                    engaged these formulations of the test because I could not see any suspicion or
                    likelihood of bias, let alone a reasonable or a real one. To my mind, there was
                    no justification for the independence of the valuers to be compromised by an
                    allegation of bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unfair advantage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I turn next to the second issue of whether the
                    defendant would have gained an unfair advantage in the 2011 rent review exercise
                    by engaging the valuers in 2010 to value the market rental value of the
                    Premises. The plaintiff submitted that the defendant in appointing the valuers
                    in 2010 would then know the likely values which the valuers would produce in
                    2011, and know which valuers to promote during stage two of the rent review
                    mechanism when the parties had to agree on the appointment of the
                        valuers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The plaintiff relied on the Australian case of
                        <em>Gollin &amp; Co v Karenlee Nominees</em> (1983) 153
                    CLR 455 (“<em>Gollin”</em>) for the
                    proposition that the defendant should not be allowed to “shop
                    around” for the lowest valuations such that it would know which valuer to
                    promote during the 2011 rent review exercise. However, the plaintiff’s
                    reliance on this case is misplaced because that case concerned unilateral
                    appointments of valuers by both parties for a rent review, and not joint
                    appointment of valuers by both parties as in the instant case. That case was
                    also concerned with the requirement of notice to the other party of the identity
                    of the valuer before a valuation is obtained, as a prerequisite of a valid
                    appointment. The Australian High Court’s comments on the undesirability of
                    “shopping around” must be read in that context: the parties in
                    that case were not to obtain valuations from each of the valuers and then
                    appoint those which were to their advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the instant case, the 2010 valuations are
                    irrelevant to the 2011 rent review exercise and therefore there is no question
                    that the defendant after allegedly having done its shopping around could appoint
                    those which were to its advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Perhaps the plaintiff was advancing the
                        <em>Gollin</em> holding a little further to suggest
                    that after the defendant knew what valuations the valuers had produced in 2010,
                    they could anticipate the values that the valuers would produce in 2011 and then
                    promote the valuers who would produce valuations in their favour. This however,
                    is premised on the assumption that the 2010 and 2011 valuations would be in some
                    manner consistent with one another. As I held above at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>, the valuers are not duty bound to abide by their previous
                    valuations. There is no reason to believe that the valuers would have a
                    propensity to value the Premises at a similar value. I had also accepted the
                    defendant’s submission that by the date of the hearing before this court,
                    more than a year would have passed since the 2010 valuations taken at value date
                    8 June 2010; the intervening events might provide the valuers with reason
                    to differ. I further agreed with Mr Cavinder that the 2010 valuation
                    figures were similar enough that no significant advantage would be obtained,
                    (although this is a submission which carries less weight because it could be
                    mere coincidence that the valuations did not differ much). The plaintiff’s
                    fears appeared to be unfounded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Would the rent review mechanism had been rendered
                inoperable?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the light of my findings that the valuers
                    were not involved in a conflict of interest; and also that the defendant had not
                    obtained any unfair advantage by engaging seven of the eight valuers in 2010, I
                    found that the rent review mechanism was still operable. I therefore dismissed
                    the plaintiff’s application with costs to the defendants to be taxed
                    unless otherwise agreed. There was no need for me to make a determination on the
                    remaining issue in this action, which was whether the court was entitled to
                    order an inquiry into the market rental value of the Premises in the event that
                    it was found that the rent review mechanism had indeed broken down. I gave the
                    parties liberty to apply in the event there was a dispute <em>vis
                        a vis</em> the terms of their joint letter to the President of SISV to
                    nominate three valuers in accordance with cl 2.4(c)(ii), and/or the joint
                    Request for Proposal to the three valuers when nominated by the President of
                    SISV.</p>
