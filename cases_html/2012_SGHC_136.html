        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is a case where eSys Technologies Pte Ltd
                    (“the plaintiff”) should have adhered to the adage “let
                    sleeping dogs lie” instead of suing nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd
                    (“the defendant”) for, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the refund of the balance of the deposit of S$2m (“the Deposit”)
                    that it paid to the defendant for the latter’s consultancy services. Its
                    filing of this suit prompted the defendant to file a counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff for a sum far in excess of the balance of the Deposit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a company which was founded and
                    incorporated in 2000 by Vikas Goel (“Vikas”). At the material time
                    in November 2006, the plaintiff was in the business of distributing computer
                    hardware. As of October and November 2006, the plaintiff had several worldwide
                    distribution agreements with Seagate Technology (“Seagate”).
                    Seagate is and was at all material times a multinational corporation based in
                    the United States which designs, manufactures and markets the Seagate and Maxtor
                    brands of hard disk drives. It is not disputed that the distributorship
                    agreements with Seagate were significant to the plaintiff as 40% of the
                    plaintiff’s sales comprised of Seagate and Maxtor products and that 40% of
                    the plaintiff’s receivables were derived from the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is a Singapore company. The
                    defendant is and was at all material times engaged in business and management
                    consultancy services, as well as corporate finance and restructuring services.
                    Its chief executive officer is and was at all material times, Nicky Tan
                    (“Nicky”). Prior to setting up the defendant, Nicky was the Head
                    of Advisory Services at PricewaterhouseCoopers Singapore. In addition, he was
                    also the Chairman of Financial Advisory Services of PricewaterhouseCoopers Asia
                    Pacific, as well as the previous Head of Global Corporate Finance at Arthur
                    Andersen for Singapore and the ASEAN region. Nicky’s curriculum vitae was
                    testimony to his expertise in the fields of corporate restructuring and
                    insolvency.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts leading to the commencement of the relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The relationship between the parties arose from
                    events which took place in November 2006. On 6 November 2006, Seagate
                    terminated various distributor agreements which it had with the plaintiff and
                    its subsidiaries. In doing so, Seagate filed an announcement with the United
                    States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC Announcement”)
                    which stated, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Today we took steps to commence the process of terminating our distributor
                        relationships with [the plaintiff] and we have ceased shipments of our
                        products to [the plaintiff]. [The plaintiff] was the largest distributor of
                        Seagate products (including Maxtor products) for the fiscal year ended June
                        30, 2006 and for the quarter ended September 29, 2006, representing
                        approximately 5% and 6% of our revenues for those respective periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In early October 2006, we initiated an audit of [the plaintiff’s]
                        point of sale records pursuant to our contractual rights to confirm the
                        accuracy and completeness of [the plaintiff’s] claims for program
                        credits under our distributor sales incentive programs. Discussions with
                        [the plaintiff] surrounding the timing, scope of work, and selection of
                        third party auditors continued until last week when [the plaintiff’s]
                        officials informed us they would deny our third party auditors access to
                        [the plaintiffs’] records to perform the requested audit
                        notwithstanding our contractual rights to do so. [The plaintiff’s]
                        officials also indicated to us that an audit would likely reveal
                        irregularities in [the plaintiff’s] compliance with the terms of our
                        incentive programs and other unspecified irregularities. In addition, [the
                        plaintiff] has failed to make full current payments on its obligations to
                        us. Accordingly, today, we notified [the plaintiff] that we are terminating
                        our commercial distributor relationships with [the plaintiff].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Then in December 2006, Seagate (and its related
                    companies) commenced Suits No. 844 of 2006 and No 854 of 2006 against the
                    plaintiff and Vikas respectively. (The two suits will be collectively referred
                    to hereinafter as “the 2006 suits”.) Suit No 844 of 2006 was
                    Seagate’s claim against the plaintiff for the then outstanding sum of more
                    than US$4m due from the plaintiff for the supply of Seagate products. Suit No
                    854 of 2006 was Seagate’s claim against Vikas as the guarantor of the
                    plaintiff’s debts under a guarantee dated 8 October 2004. In October
                    2006, this court dealt with five Registrar’s Appeals arising out of the
                    2006 suits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The agreement between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The events detailed at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> and <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above had severe
                    ramifications for the plaintiff. The termination of the distributorship
                    agreements with Seagate, a significant revenue generator of the plaintiff,
                    raised concerns in various parties who had vested interests in the plaintiff.
                    Such concerns resulted in actions which were financially detrimental to the
                    plaintiff. In particular, creditors and suppliers of the plaintiff cancelled
                    credit facilities while bank creditors demanded repayment or furnishing of
                    additional security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In a bid to alleviate its dire situation, the
                    plaintiff sought legal advice from its solicitors, Drew &amp; Napier LLC, whose
                    S Nair (“Nair”) recommended that the defendant be engaged as an
                    adviser. Nair then arranged a meeting with Nicky on 11 November 2006 on an
                    urgent basis. On 14 November 2006, the plaintiff and defendant signed a
                    letter of engagement (“the Engagement Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As the Engagement Letter is central to the
                    dispute between the parties, its salient terms are reproduced
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The main reason for appointing the defendant was
                    stated in the Engagement letter (“the Appointment Clause”) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT
                            ADVISOR</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Allegations of irregularities in a distribution deal between [the
                        plaintiff] and [Seagate] was made by Seagate in a filing on 6 November
                        2006 with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (“the
                        Allegations”) by Seagate. The Allegations may result in litigation
                        (“Potential Litigation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The scope of the defendant’s employment
                    was stated in the Engagement Letter (“Scope of Work Clause”) as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Engagement Letter provided that two types
                    of fees were liable to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. The first type
                    of fees comprised of, <em>inter alia</em>, time costs and
                    out-of-pocket expenses. This was stated in the Engagement Letter as follows
                    (“the Fees Clause”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The defendant’s] fees for the engagement comprise our time costs
                        fee, out-of pocket expenses (including fees of any experts or professionals)
                        and such other fees as may be provided for in any addendum to this letter.
                        [The defendant] will raise monthly progress billings (“Monthly
                        Progress Billings”) based on our time costs and other fees and
                        expenses. [The defendant’s] charge out rates and other charges and
                        expenses, are set out in the attached schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The schedule (“the Fees
                    Schedule”) to the Engagement Letter, referred to in the Fees Clause (at
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above) essentially detailed the
                    hourly charge-out rates of personnel of the defendant, which was based upon
                    seniority. The rates ranged from US$100 per hour for an associate, to US$1,000
                    per hour for Nicky.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second type of fees were value-added fees
                    (“VAF”), which were contingent upon the defendant performing
                    certain types of work which resulted in value being added to the plaintiff. This
                    was stated in the Engagement Letter as follows (“VAF

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the successful completion of any of the above foregoing scope of work

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The termination of the defendant’s engagement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After the Engagement Letter was executed, the
                    defendant carried out work for the plaintiff. The precise nature of the work
                    done by the defendant, as well as its efficacy, was hotly disputed by the
                    parties and is discussed at length below. The defendant rendered two invoices
                    (collectively “the two invoices”) to the plaintiff for time costs
                    and out-of-pocket expenses on 4 and 6 February, 2007 for the sums of
                    S$663,759.64 and S$69,680.15 respectively. The plaintiff terminated the
                    defendant’s engagement on the day that the second invoice was
                    rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim and defence to counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff sought an account of the fees
                    and expenses from the defendant pursuant to the above two invoices (“an
                    Account”). Further, the plaintiff claimed the sum of S$1,266,560.21 which
                    represented the balance of the Deposit after allowing for deduction of the
                    amounts in the two invoices (at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above).
                    The plaintiff contended that it was an implied term of the Engagement Letter
                    that the defendant must furnish an Account. As a corollary to this contention,
                    the plaintiff argued that the two invoices and their contents did not suffice as
                    an Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In respect of the defendant’s
                    counterclaim (see [20]),
                    the plaintiff asserted that the defendant was not entitled to any
                VAF.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In its defence to the claim for an Account,
                    the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s claim for an Account was
                    neither genuine nor <em>bona fide</em>. The defendant also
                    contended, in the alternative, that there had to be implied a term that any
                    Account sought by the plaintiff had to be obtained within a reasonable
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     By way of a counterclaim, the defendant sought
                    a declaration that it was entitled to an additional fee from the plaintiff
                    pursuant to the VAF Clause (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above).
                    The defendant further contended that it was entitled to VAF far in excess of the
                    balance of the Deposit and that pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter,
                    it was not liable to refund any portion of the Deposit under the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim for an Account</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff contended that it was incumbent
                    upon the defendant to furnish the following details in the two invoices</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Details of the time spent by the
                        defendant’s various employees carrying out the scope of work specified
                        in the Engagement Letter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Details of the actual work performed by such
                        employees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        hourly rates of such employees; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Details of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff contended that because the fees
                    invoiced by the defendant were based upon time costs incurred by the latter, an
                    Account of the matters set out above (at [21]) was essential for the
                    plaintiff to verify whether the fees levied were in accordance with the
                    Engagement Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff contended that the furnishing of
                    an Account (as detailed at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>) should be
                    implied regardless of whether the “officious bystander” test or
                    the “business efficacy” test was applied in the analysis. If such
                    a term was not implied, the plaintiff argued, the defendant would essentially
                    have a <em>carte blanche</em> to charge for its services as
                    it deemed fit and in disregard of the terms of the Engagement
                Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There were other submissions made by the
                    plaintiff in relation to the issue of whether or not it was entitled to an
                    Account. As I ultimately found that those submissions were not relevant in the
                    final analysis, I shall only set them out in brief. The plaintiff alleged that
                    an Account was not forthcoming from the defendant despite requests from the
                    plaintiff for the same. In support of this allegation, the plaintiff relied on
                    correspondence exchanged between the parties’ solicitors. In addition, the
                    plaintiff alleged that there was evidence adduced that the defendant had
                    overcharged the plaintiff, and that the invoices were not a true reflection of
                    what the defendant was entitled to charge pursuant to the Engagement
                    Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As stated earlier (at [19]), the defendant contended
                    that the plaintiff’s claim for an Account was not <em>bona
                        fide</em>. In this regard, the defendant relied in the main on the
                    following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the plaintiff sought an Account
                        only 3½ years after the invoices were rendered;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the plaintiff never requested the
                        defendant for an Account in the interval since the invoices were rendered,
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the
                        plaintiff had no interest in receiving an Account whatsoever given that it
                        was no longer a company of any worth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Alternatively, the defendant submitted that it
                    should be an implied term of the Engagement Letter that any request for an
                    Account ought to be made within a reasonable time. As a matter of course, the
                    defendant also argued that such reasonable time must be construed as being less
                    than 3½ years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on implied terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to an
                    Account would depend on whether a relevant term can be implied in the Engagement
                    Letter. The Court of Appeal succinctly summarised the law on implied terms in
                        <em>Chua Choon Cheng and others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and
                        another appeal</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 (“<em>Chua Choon Cheng</em>”) (at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that “a court will <em>not
                            lightly</em> imply a term into a contract” [emphasis
                            original]: <em>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron

                        The rule of thumb is that the more detailed or complex a contract is, the
                        less likely it is that the court will imply a term into that contract. The
                        touchstone for implying a term into a contract is always “necessity
                        and not merely reasonableness”: <em>Hiap Hong &amp; Co

                        parties”, which has to be objectively ascertained. In <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte

                        then was), after a detailed analysis of the historical origins of these
                        tests, concluded that the two tests are but different facets of the same
                        coin; “the ‘officious bystander’ test is
                            the <em>practical mode by which</em> the
                        ‘business efficacy’ test is implemented” [emphasis in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The threshold consideration of whether or not
                    a term is necessary to be implied, alluded to by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Chua Choon Cheng</em> was discussed by Chao Hick
                    Tin JA in <em>Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Hong Huat

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Be that as it may,
                            in considering the question of implied terms, it must be borne in mind
                            that the touchstone is necessity and not merely reasonableness. In the
                            words of Scrutton LJ in <em>In re
                                </em><em>Comptoir Commercial Anversois and
                                Power, Son &amp; Co’s Arbitration</em> [1920] 1 KB
                            868 at 899–900:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Court … ought not to imply a term merely because it would
                            be a reasonable term to include if the parties had thought about the
                            matter, or because one party, if he had thought about the matter, would
                            not have made the contract unless the term was included; it must be such
                            a necessary term that both parties must have intended that it should be
                            a term of the contract, and have only not expressed it because its
                            necessity was so obvious that it was taken for granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    Of course, a term to be implied must always be
                            equitable and reasonable. The court will imply a term if from the
                            language of the contract and the surrounding circumstances an inference
                            should be made that the parties must have intended the stipulation in
                            question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is well established that two tests may be
                    applied in considering whether or not a term may be implied into a contract.
                    They are commonly known as the “officious bystander” and
                    “business efficacy” tests, and were summarised by Andrew Phang
                    Boon Leong J in <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v
                        Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 (at [29] –
                    [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    It has always been
                            acknowledged that particular terms might be implied into particular
                            contracts. However, in order not to undermine the concept of freedom of
                            contract itself, terms would be implied only rarely – in
                            exceptional cases where, as one famous case put it, it
                                was <em>necessary</em> to give
                                “<em>business efficacy</em>” to
                            the contract (see <em>per</em> Bowen LJ (as then was) in the English Court of
                            Appeal decision in <em>The Moorcock</em>
                            (1889) 14 PD 64). In the words of Bowen LJ himself (at
                        68):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called, a covenant in law, as
                            distinguished from an express contract or express warranty, really is in
                            all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon
                            reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously
                            have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of
                            giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of
                            consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either
                            side; and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and there are
                            many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that
                            in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed
                            intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction
                            such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it
                            should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires
                            to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the
                            transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who
                            are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of the
                            transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure,
                            but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must
                            have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be
                            responsible for in respect of those perils or chances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    Indeed,
                            Lord Esher MR adopted a similar approach, although it is
                            Bowen LJ’s judgment that is most often cited. This is
                            probably due to the fact that a close perusal of
                            Lord Esher MR’s judgment will reveal that the learned
                            Master of the Rolls did not <em>explicitly</em> adopt the “business
                            efficacy” test as such. It might be usefully observed at this
                            juncture that the third judge, Fry LJ, agreed with both
                            Bowen LJ and Lord Esher MR (see [29] <em>supra</em> at
                            71).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    There was another test,
                            which soon became equally famous. It was by MacKinnon LJ in another
                            English Court of Appeal decision. This was the famous “<em>officious bystander</em>” test which was
                            propounded in <em>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926)
                                Limited</em> [1939] 2 KB 206 at 227 (“<em>Shirlaw</em>”) (affirmed, [1940] AC 701), as
                            follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then
                            said: “Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be
                            implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes
                            without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their
                            bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision
                            for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common
                            ‘Oh, of course!’”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">At least it is true, I think, that, if a term were never implied by a
                            judge unless it could pass that test, he could not be held to be
                            wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Interestingly, the essay referred to above was in fact a public lecture
                        delivered at the London School of Economics in the University of London: see
                        Sir Frank MacKinnon, <em>Some Aspects of Commercial
                            Law – A Lecture Delivered at the London School of Economics on
                            3 March 1926</em> (Oxford University Press, 1926) (and
                        see, especially, p 13).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Both these tests are firmly established in the
                            local case law (in addition to the cases cited below, see also, for
                                example, <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Batshita

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With the relevant legal principles in mind, I
                    turn now to analyse the parties’ respective cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The threshold consideration is whether the
                    term that the defendant be liable to render an Account was of such necessity
                    that both parties intended for its inclusion in the Engagement Letter. In this
                    regard, the plaintiff’s position was clear – that it must have
                    intended that the defendant justify its billings and that the only manner in
                    which this could be done was by the furnishing of an Account. As to whether the
                    defendant’s intent was consonant with the plaintiff’s, it was
                    pertinent that Nicky admitted during cross-examination that, in his view, there
                    was a “minimum obligation” to explain to clients how time costs
                    were calculated:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Tan, do you therefore take it that if a client
                            does ask – whether it’s one year, two years or three years
                            – there is an obligation on your firm to provide that information?
                            Or is it your position that there is no obligation?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I think contractually there is no provision in my
                            engagement letter that I should provide the breakdown; but
                            professionally, if any client were to ask me, that is <em>a minimum obligation I owe my client, to explain to my client how
                                the time costs have been built up, who spent what time on the job,
                                and how I billed my client</em>. If my client were to ask, you
                            rest assured I will tell my client very promptly the
                        information.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You said that’s the minimum obligation. So
                            that’s the very least you would do?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It depends what my client ask me. If my client asks
                            me, Mr Tan, “Can you tell me how many hours you have spent on the
                            job?” I’ll be very happy to tell him “This is how
                            many hours I have spent.” If he asks me, “Can you tell me
                            how many hours Mr Dan has spent on the job” I’ll be very
                            happy to do so. It depends on what information my client asks me. No one
                            in Singapore or around the world had ever sued me for not providing a
                            breakdown on the time costs”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Nicky’s description of the furnishing of
                    time-costs to clients as “a minimum obligation” spoke volumes
                    about his state of mind when entering into the Engagement Letter, <em>ie</em>, that the furnishing of an Account was essential and
                    taken for granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Given that both parties were <em>ad idem</em> insofar as the necessity of an Account being
                    rendered was concerned, I have little hesitation in holding that it was an
                    implied term of the Engagement Letter that the defendant was obliged to provide
                    an Account to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I turn now to address the defendant’s
                    contention that a term had to be equally implied in the Engagement Letter that
                    it was only liable to render an Account “within reasonable time”,
                    and that such time had passed. In this regard, s 6(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap
                    163, 1996 Rev Ed) states that “an action for an account shall not be
                    brought in respect of any matter which arose more than 6 years before the
                    commencement for the action”. The plaintiff’s right to an Account
                    was not time-barred when it commenced the present action on 9 September
                    2010, which was well within six years of the date of the second invoice
                    (6 February 2007). However, the plaintiff certainly took its time in filing
                    this suit and I shall return to the possible motives for its action later (at
                        [90]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the defendant entitled to VAF?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The context surrounding the Engagement Letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As noted earlier (at [6]), the SEC Announcement had
                    dire consequences for the plaintiff. It was not disputed that the immediate
                    consequences of the SEC Announcement were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff received written
                        demands from bank creditors for repayment or additional security amounting

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     The plaintiff’s bank creditors cancelled

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     The plaintiff’s suppliers cancelled

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     At the time the bank creditors made the above
                    demands, the plaintiff was unable to perform its repayment obligations. The
                    plaintiff’s inability to meet its repayment obligations was due to the
                    nature of its operations. As a trading company whose primary assets were
                    inventories and receivables, the plaintiff needed to realise its inventories and
                    collect its receivables in order to meet its liabilities. This much was conceded

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It was against this backdrop of the fear of
                    insolvency on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant was
                engaged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">VAF was payable on restructured bank liabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant’s case was that it
                    successfully restructured the plaintiff’s liabilities <em>vis-à-vis</em> the bank creditors. As such, it was entitled to VAF
                    amounting to 5% of such liabilities. In this regard, the defendant’s main
                    contention was that it had successfully secured agreement from the bank
                    creditors to stave off their demands, thereby enabling the plaintiff to
                    eventually repay its debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Nicky advised the plaintiff that in order to
                    convince the bank creditors that it was in their best interests to accord more
                    time for repayment, the plaintiff had to create a “virtuous”, as
                    opposed to a “vicious” cycle. In the former situation, all
                    creditors would be treated equally and no creditor would be preferred over
                    others. As a result, the plaintiff would secure the bank creditors’
                    agreement not to enforce their claims immediately, thereby allowing the
                    plaintiff to fully realise its assets and pay off its liabilities thereafter. In
                    the “vicious” cycle, some creditors would be paid in preference to
                    others thereby creating impetus for other creditors to enforce their claims
                    against the plaintiff immediately to the detriment of the plaintiff. Towards
                    this end, Nicky informed Vikas that a meeting with the bank creditors had to be
                    convened. In addition, Nicky told Vikas that at such a meeting, the plaintiff
                    should do the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     Present the most up to date
                        operational and financial information pertaining to the
                    plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     Provide
                        updates on all relevant matters which included the ramifications pertaining
                        to the SEC Announcement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     Assuage the bank creditors’ concerns;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_d"></a>(d)     Persuade the
                        bank creditors to agree to a standstill agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Vikas agreed to the plan suggested by Nicky
                    and decided that the plaintiff should proceed to arrange a meeting with the bank
                    creditors. The work done by the defendant, in the run up to the bank creditors
                    meeting, was not disputed at the trial. The defendant prepared the presentation
                    which was used during the bank creditors meeting which was eventually held on
                    24 November 2006 (“the Meeting”). The presentation detailed
                    the most updated financial position of the plaintiff and provided information of
                    the continued viability of the plaintiff. The decision to provide updated
                    financial information pertaining to the plaintiff was a strategic one taken by
                    Nicky. Prior to the Meeting, several of the bank creditors were of the view that
                    the plaintiff had not been transparent in furnishing information pertaining to
                    its financial position. In a bid to reverse the situation, the defendant decided
                    to provide the bank creditors with updated financial figures. Hence, the
                    defendant requested for the plaintiff’s management accounts to be updated
                    to 18 November 2006. Nicky explained during cross-examination that by doing
                    so, the defendant sought to demonstrate to the bank creditors that the plaintiff
                    was going to be transparent henceforth:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nicky: ... The fact that we produced numbers up to 18 November, to
                        show the banks “Look, forget about the past complaint about lack of
                        transparency; we are now – this is a new regime. We are giving you
                        numbers up to three – five days, seven days before you come to the
                        meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is the key. You hear – you see all the letters from the bank
                        complaining, “You are not transparent, I can’t meet you, I
                        can’t get any information from you.” One of the key things that
                        I was desperate to show to the bank, within two weeks of our appointment, we
                        got you the latest number. We got you the number as of 18 November. No
                        company produced such things.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key thing about steadying a ship when you are insolvent or you are
                        unable to pay the bank, what they need is clear, transparent information.
                        They don’t mind dealing with bad news; they don’t like to deal
                        with uncertainties. So you have to give clear, transparent information, so
                        they know what the situation is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Before the Meeting was convened, Nicky also
                    convinced the plaintiff that it should offer to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers
                    as the bank creditors’ financial adviser. In Nicky’s view, such a
                    move would boost the bank creditors’ confidence in the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Nicky chaired the Meeting which was attended
                    by three of his associates and three lawyers from Drew &amp; Napier. The Meeting
                    was a crucial event as it represented the first opportunity, after the bank
                    creditors had issued their demands on the plaintiff (at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above), for the plaintiff to convince the bank creditors to
                    withhold their demands and agree to giving more time for the plaintiff to repay
                    its liabilities. The minutes of the Meeting recorded that Nicky did the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     Distributed presentation slides and
                        took the bankers through the financial information of the plaintiff
                        contained therein;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     Informed the bank creditors that there were potential investors in
                        the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     Explained to the bank creditors the nature of the plaintiff’s
                        business in the light of which it would be in the bank creditors’ best
                        interest to hold off their demands against the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     Informed the bank creditors that the
                        plaintiff was formulating a repayment plan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_e"></a>(e)     Informed the bank creditors that no creditor was
                        going to be paid in preference to others; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_f"></a>(f)     Stated that the plaintiff was prepared to file
                        an application under s 210(10) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) if
                        necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Meeting concluded with representatives of
                    the attending bank creditors agreeing to meet amongst themselves the following
                    week. In addition, there was agreement that none of the bank creditors would
                    commence legal proceedings against the plaintiff in the interim. Indeed, none of
                    the bank creditors took action against the plaintiff after the Meeting and the
                    plaintiff was able to repay all its debts by March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">VAF payable on the Teledata deal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was the defendant’s case that it
                    performed work in relation to an investment by Teledata Informatics Ltd
                    (“Teledata”), of approximately US$100m in the plaintiff
                    (“the Teledata deal”). As such, the defendant claimed that it was
                    entitled to VAF amounting to 5% of the value of the said
                investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Vikas told Nicky about a proposal by Teledata
                    for a potential investment in the plaintiff at the first meeting between them on
                    11 November 2006. The investment contemplated the injection of US$100m by
                    Teledata into the plaintiff. In return, Teledata would obtain shares in the
                    plaintiff. On the same day, Nicky was given the draft Letter of Intent
                    (“draft LOI”) in respect of the said investment. Pursuant to the
                    draft LOI, Teledata would purchase 51% of the shares in the plaintiff in
                    consideration of US$60m. In addition, Teledata would provide a loan of US$40m to
                    the plaintiff as working capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Nicky’s evidence was that he advised
                    Vikas not to rush into a deal envisioned by the draft LOI, as the investment
                    structure was far from ideal. This was because the plaintiff would, as a result
                    of the LOI, have a pool of unencumbered cash would could rouse the bank
                    creditors’ interest in immediate repayment. In addition, the injection of
                    fresh funds directly into the plaintiff would give the bank creditors impetus to
                    put the plaintiff into liquidation or judicial management. Either scenario would
                    be detrimental to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Instead of the investment structure envisioned
                    by the draft LOI, Nicky advised on four types of structures to facilitate the
                    objective of obtaining new monies to restructure the terms of repayment to the
                    bank creditors as well as to provide working capital for the plaintiff.
                    Nicky’s advice was eventually incorporated into five agreements which were
                    entered into by the plaintiff with a company called Rainforest Trading Limited
                    (“Rainforest”). The five agreements are discussed in detail at
                        <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Holding Company
                        Structure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        US$5m VG (Vikas) Payment Structure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Revaluation Excess VG (Vikas) Payment Structure;

                        India Transfer Structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was the defendant’s
                    case that the abovementioned four investment structures were incorporated into
                    agreements between the plaintiff and Teledata. The agreements are discussed in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On 29 November 2006, a Share Subscription
                    Agreement (“SSA”) was executed by the plaintiff, Vikas and
                    Teledata. The key feature of the SSA was its investment structure (“the
                    Holding Company Structure”) whereby:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     A special purpose vehicle
                        (“SPV”) would be incorporated for the purpose of the
                        investment (the SPV that was eventually incorporated was
                    Rainforest);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     Vikas
                        would transfer all his shares in the plaintiff to the SPV in consideration
                        of approximately 49% of the shares in the SPV; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     The SPV would provide a secured loan
                        of US$60m to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition, the SSA provided
                    that Teledata would also provide a loan of US$40m to either the plaintiff or the
                    SPV.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On 29 November 2006, the plaintiff, Vikas
                    and Teledata executed a supplemental agreement to the SSA (“First
                    Supplemental”) which provided for the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff would transfer 48.6%
                        of its shareholding in eSys India (a subsidiary of the plaintiff) to Vikas
                        at a nominal consideration of US$1. Such a transfer resulted in Vikas
                        – or his nominees – owning 49.9% of the shareholding in eSys
                        India, and the plaintiff owning the remaining 50.1% of eSys India;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     eSys India
                        would enter into a Business Transfer Agreement with a new entity
                        (“Newco”), which would provide for the transfer by eSys India
                        of its existing business. eSys India retained its existing tangibles and
                        fixed assets (including the land which it owned in India). Newco would then
                        be owned by an entity known as Holdco, where Holdco would be 50.001% owned
                        by Teledata and/or its nominees, and 49.999% owned by Vikas and/or his
                        nominees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The effect of the above structure meant that
                    Teledata would own 50.001% interest in the business of eSys India <em>via</em> Teledata’s shareholding in Holdco. In
                    addition, the First Supplemental provided for Holdco to pay the sum of US$5m to
                    Vikas and/or his nominees. The First Supplemental also provided that parties
                    would perform a revaluation of the plaintiff’s assets, and that should
                    such revaluation of the plaintiff result in any surplus over the sum of US$60m,
                    the surplus less the sum of US$5m would be paid to Vikas and/or his nominees
                    (this was effectively the Revaluation Excess VG Payment Structure referred to in
                    [48(c)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The effect of the First Supplemental was such
                    that Teledata would own approximately 50% interest in the business of eSys India
                    via Teledata’s shareholding in Holdco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On 29 November 2006, the plaintiff, Vikas
                    and Teledata entered into a Second Supplemental Agreement to the SSA
                    (“Second Supplemental”). The salient amendment to the SSA, vide
                    the Second Supplemental, was that Vikas was to be issued 60,000,000 shares in
                    the SPV whilst Teledata was to be issued 60,000,001 shares in the
                same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On 9 February 2007 (after the
                    defendant’s engagement was terminated), the plaintiff, Vikas and Teledata
                    entered into the third supplemental agreement to the SSA (“Third
                    Supplemental”). The Third Supplemental provided for a company Baytech Inc
                    to be appointed as Teledata’s nominee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On 14 February 2007, the plaintiff, Vikas
                    and Teledata executed the fourth supplemental agreement to the SSA
                    (“Fourth Supplemental”) which provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     Upon the completion of the
                        subscription for shares in Rainforest by Vikas and Teledata, Vikas would
                        sell 5,000,000 shares in Rainforest to Teledata in consideration of
                        US$5m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     Vikas
                        would sell an additional 1,200,001 of his shares in Rainforest to Teledata
                        for a sum of not less than US$1,200,001 or at a fair market value to be
                        determined by the parties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Fourth Supplemental Agreement retained the Holding
                        Company Structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As a result of the injection of funds into the
                    plaintiff via the deal with Teledata, the defendant claimed that it was entitled
                    to VAF computed at 5% of the value of such injection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">VAF was payable on restructured supply creditor liabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The crux of the defendant’s claim was
                    that the standstill it achieved with the bank creditors enabled the plaintiff to
                    continue trading with its suppliers and further led to such suppliers not
                    demanding immediate repayment of amounts owing to them. The defendant therefore
                    claimed that it was entitled to VAF calculated on the basis of 5% of the
                    supplier/trade creditor liabilities as
                “restructured”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was VAF payable on restructured bank liabilities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The plaintiff contended that the
                    “informal standstill” (at [44]) did not entitle the
                    defendant to claim 5% of TGVA as VAF under the VAF clause (at [13]) even though the plaintiff
                    did not dispute that the “informal standstill” was instrumental in
                    facilitating the plaintiff’s eventual repayment of its liabilities. The
                    plaintiff contended that the omission of any reference to a “standstill
                    agreement” in the Engagement Letter meant that the parties did not intend
                    for any VAF to be payable upon occurrence of such events. In particular, the
                    plaintiff contended that the bank liabilities were not
                    “restructured” because “standstill agreements”
                    merely involve creditors withholding or refraining from enforcing their existing
                    rights, and do not result in the alteration of the creditors’ rights as a
                    result of which the plaintiff enjoyed a benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was VAF payable on the Teledata deal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff’s defence to this aspect
                    of the counterclaim was twofold. First, that the defendant did not perform
                    substantial work in relation to the deal involving Teledata. Second, that
                    Teledata did not invest in the plaintiff but in Rainforest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Vikas averred that the defendant was not
                    involved at all in the investment involving Teledata. The relevant portions of
                    his affidavit of evidence–in-chief (“AEIC”) read:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant did not render any
                        advice and/or assistance to the plaintiff in relation to the transaction
                        with Teledata;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     the structure of the intended transaction with Teledata was based on and
                        formulated from discussions between representatives of Teledata and Vikas.
                        The defendant did not render any advice orally or otherwise to Vikas or to
                        the plaintiff in relation to such structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Vikas further averred that while the defendant
                    was kept informed of the negotiations between the plaintiff and Teledata, this
                    was only because it was part of the defendant’s scope of work to procure
                    new investors, and also because the plaintiff was hopeful that the defendant
                    could have procured a better offer than that proposed by Teledata.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on contractual interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) endorsed the contextual
                    approach to contractual interpretation (<em>Zurich
                        Insurance</em> at [121]). Such an approach permits reference to
                    extrinsic evidence even if the term involved is not ambiguous (<em>Zurich Insurance</em> at [114] – [120] and [132(c)]).
                    There are two conditions precedent to the use of such extrinsic evidence: first,
                    that the evidence must be “relevant [and] reasonably available to all the
                    contracting parties”; second, that it must “relate to a clear or
                    obvious context” (<em>Zurich Insurance</em> at
                    [132(d)], see also [125] and [128] – [129]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The defendant’s entitlement to VAF
                    hinged upon whether or not it had performed work which satisfied the conditions
                    precedent to such entitlement pursuant to the Engagement Letter (at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). I turn now to address each of the
                    defendant’s claims in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">VAF on restructured bank liabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The critical issue for determination is, did
                    the informal standstill by the banks <em>restructure</em>
                    liabilities pursuant to the VAF clause? It was not disputed that the defendant
                    was instrumental in getting the bank creditors to agree to an informal
                    standstill. What was disputed, however, was whether the informal standstill
                    “restructured” the liabilities of the plaintiff in a manner which
                    would entitle the defendant to a VAF. According to the defendant’s case,
                    it had completed item (iii) of the Scope of Work Clause (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) by advising and assisting the
                    plaintiff in restructuring the plaintiff’s financial arrangements, which
                    led to the plaintiff’s liabilities being restructured or avoided pursuant
                    to (a) of the VAF Clause (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In my view, given the context in which the
                    Engagement Letter was entered into, the standstill agreement undoubtedly
                    entitled the defendant to claim VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter.
                    Consequently, VAF is payable to the defendant calculated at 5% of the total bank
                    liabilities which were the subject of the standstill agreement. The reasons are
                    set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The context in which the Engagement Letter was
                    entered into is critical in determining exactly what the plaintiff sought to
                    achieve in restructuring its liabilities. Vikas had stated the following in
                    cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The context in which this scope of work [under the
                            Engagement Letter] was sought was the banks were seeking payments
                            against you on an urgent basis; correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And you needed breathing space?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And you needed nTan to assist you [to] restructure
                            the obligations; correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I wouldn’t say “restructure”,
                            but talk to the banks to adopt a path which made sense, that we would be
                            able to pay off – just breathing space, as you would put it,
                            yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">“Breathing space” means they would
                            hold back on their demands against you; correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">They would give us some time</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I mean, if you put it that way, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     At a later stage, Vikas had (in
                    cross-examination) conceded that the main reason why the plaintiff hired the
                    defendant was so that the latter could help the former obtain a standstill and a
                    breathing space from the bank creditors:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your banks didn’t want to back off, right?
                            They were making demand after demand, and we saw that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What you needed was an ability to stave off the
                            demands until such time when you were able to pay them;
                        right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s why you went to consult with Drew
                            &amp; Napier and accepted their advice to consult with Mr Nicky

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Consequently, it cannot be disputed that the
                    work done by the defendant was crucial in ensuring that the bank creditors
                    agreed not to enforce their claims against the plaintiff immediately. In this
                    regard, Louis Han of HSBC, who was present at the Meeting testified as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">...First, in order for the bank to agree to an
                            informal standstill, would you agree that the bank must first be given
                            comfort that the bank has a chance of being better off if you allow the
                            company to trade as a going concern than if you move in and put in
                            insolvency professionals immediately?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That would be correct, yes</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And in order for you to get that comfort, you must
                            be able to see from the financials presented at this meeting that the
                            company indeed, based on its own financials, is able to continue to
                            trade as a going concern, with a better – with the prospect of a
                            better realisation at the end.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That is the ultimate objective, yes, to maximise
                            recovery, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes. And you should also expect to see, as you had
                            asked, a realistic repayment plan coming up from the company;
                            correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah, a repayment plan, restructuring plan,
                            whatever – yeah. Yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If you were given that amount of comfort, then you
                            would be prepared to agree to a standstill?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, of course, because to do a standstill, we want
                            to make sure that certain controls are in place, to make sure that
                            someone is there to ensure there is no preferential
                        treatment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In the end, an informal standstill was given to the
                            company, was it not?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It was, yeah. No banks took actions, so it was a
                            – there was an informal standstill, yeah because – I think I
                            will clarify: “standstill” means formal or informal. We
                            have a formal standstill, it means everybody sign up on a piece of
                            paper.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It is also not in dispute that the informal
                    standstill allowed the plaintiff to repay the bank creditors eventually by March
                    2007. Vikas admitted that after the Meeting, none of the bank creditors filed
                    writs or attempted to wind up the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff was able
                    to realise its receivables and inventories in an orderly fashion and which
                    enabled it to repay the bank creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I further noted that Vikas conceded at one
                    stage during cross-examination that he actually considered the informal
                    standstill to constitute restructuring of the plaintiff’s existing
                    liabilities:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I wanted to understand from you what you understood
                            “restructuring financial arrangements” to mean. And
                            I’m suggesting to you that it means to help with the banks in a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Vikas’ concession during
                    cross-examination is unsurprising, given that the survival of the plaintiff
                    hinged upon whether or not it received more time to repay its debts. However,
                    Vikas shifted his position during re-examination and proffered a new general
                    definition of “restructuring”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Restructuring, especially in context of banks, and you read it in the
                        newspapers every day, with every day some company undergoing this or that.
                        Basically means either the banks take a haircut; they say, “Instead
                        of $100 I take $50” – or $25, whatever; or they say,
                        “Okay, we waive you of interest” or give you – I mean, a
                        loan in a different format. And then sometimes in terms of time period also,
                        it is – short-term borrowings are converted into long term loans which
                        could be three years or – like, minimum, one to two years but three
                        years, five years, with soft interest rates and payment plans where the
                        business could be revised and the money could be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Vikas further attempted to proffer his
                    definition of “restructured” in the context of the Engagement
                    Letter:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Well, the clear-cut understanding for me, and also during the discussions,
                        was if I owe someone $100, it becomes $50; out of the 50, he keeps 5 per
                        cent, I keep 95 percent. Not if I have to pay the same amount of money and
                        still on top of that I pay another 5 percent, because there was no way I
                        would be able to pay that 5 percent or it would have made any sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In my view, Vikas’ suggestion as to what
                    he viewed as “restructuring” in the context of the Engagement
                    Letter was an afterthought. It was clear that at the material time, the
                    plaintiff was satisfied to have its debts “restructured” in any
                    manner which would ensure its continued viability – and that such a result
                    could only be achieved if its existing obligations for immediate repayment to
                    the bank creditors were deferred. Vikas’ purported definition of the term
                    “restructure” was also completely untenable as it would limit the
                    definition of the said term to a deal which accorded the plaintiff with a
                    reduction in its total liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Given the context in which the Engagement
                    Letter was entered into, this clearly was not the case. The plaintiff was eager
                    to “restructure” its liabilities in a manner which accorded it
                    valuable time to repay its obligations. In this regard, there were many ways in
                    which this could have been achieved. For instance if, instead of the informal
                    standstill, the defendant had obtained the agreement of all the bank creditors
                    to accept bonds issued by the plaintiff at 5% interest over the course of 5
                    years, the plaintiff’s total monetary liability would still have been
                    increased. Yet, in such a situation, the plaintiff would be hard pressed to
                    argue that its liabilities had not been restructured even though all that the
                    bond issue achieved would have been additional time for the plaintiff to repay
                    its debts, albeit at a higher total cost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I am therefore of the view that the informal
                    standstill constituted restructuring of the plaintiff’s liabilities
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the bank creditors because the
                    character of such liabilities had morphed dramatically. Prior to the informal
                    standstill being granted, the plaintiff’s liabilities were due and
                    payable. This was a situation which could potentially cripple the plaintiff.
                    After the informal standstill was granted, the plaintiff’s bank
                    liabilities were no longer due and payable forthwith. The plaintiff was
                    therefore given the crucial breathing space it needed to repay its debts within
                    an unspecified period of time. In the result, I find that the plaintiff’s
                    liabilities in relation to the bank creditors were restructured pursuant to the
                    VAF clause as there was a significant shift in the temporal nature of such
                    liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was VAF payable on the Teledata deal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The defendant’s claim in respect of VAF
                    payable on the Teledata deal, was: first, pursuant to (v) of the Scope of Work
                    Clause (at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) whereby the defendant
                    had assisted the plaintiff in securing an investor, <em>ie</em>, Teledata. Second, the defendant’s work it was
                    submitted, had resulted in the injection of new equity raised by the plaintiff
                    pursuant to (c) of the VAF Clause (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The plaintiff denied that the defendant had
                    performed work in relation to the deal involving Teledata. As a secondary
                    argument, the plaintiff contended that the injection of funds by Teledata did
                    not benefit the plaintiff. As a result, it was submitted, the defendant was not
                    entitled to VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter. I turn now to consider the
                    two issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Nicky had performed work in relation to the Teledata
                deal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the course of the trial, it was patently
                    clear that the plaintiff’s position that the defendant was not involved in
                    the Teledata deal was untenable. Prior to the defendant being informed of the
                    proposed investment by Teledata, the plaintiff was contemplating the execution
                    of a deal with Teledata which was completely different from that which was
                    eventually executed. This is clear from the draft LOI which envisioned a direct
                    injection of cash by Teledata into the plaintiff in exchange for 60% shares in
                    the plaintiff. Based upon the draft LOI and the complete absence of any evidence
                    that the plaintiff was aware of the Holding Company Structure before the
                    involvement of the defendant, it was evident that the only investment structure
                    which was contemplated by the plaintiff and Vikas – prior to the
                    involvement of the defendant – was a direct injection of funds by Teledata
                    in consideration for shares. The question which immediately arose is: why were
                    the agreements (at [49]
                    –
                    [55]) markedly different
                    from the draft LOI?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Nicky’s evidence as to why he had
                    advised Vikas to adopt the investment structures was not only logical and
                    cogent, it was also not contradicted at trial. Nicky testified that he met Vikas
                    on 25 November 2006, and on this occasion explained the Holding Company
                    Structure to Vikas diagrammatically; (the drawing was admitted into evidence).
                    Vikas alleged, during the course of the trial, that it was he who had taught
                    Nicky about the Holding Company Structure at the meeting on 25 November
                    2006. This allegation was, in my view, completely spurious. Nicky’s
                    expertise at the material time, in the realm of corporate finance was
                    encapsulated in his <em>curriculam vitae</em>. In addition,
                    if Vikas had personal knowledge of the sophisticated investment structures
                    – without assistance from Nicky – which were eventually incorporated
                    into the agreements, then Vikas would not have consulted Nicky at all in the
                    first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Consequently, I have no hesitation in finding
                    that the Holding Company Structure was incorporated in the agreements between
                    Teledata and the plaintiff, because of the defendant’s advice to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Nicky had contended that he initiated the idea
                    of US$5m VG Payment Structure and the Revaluation Excess VG Payment Structure
                    which were eventually incorporated in the agreements between Teledata and the
                    plaintiff. In support of his contention, the defendant tendered a Bundle of
                    Teledata Diagrams (“Diagrams”) which provided contemporaneous
                    notes supporting Nicky’s assertion. Neither Nicky’s evidence in this
                    regard nor the contents of the Diagrams were challenged by the plaintiff. As
                    such, I find that the defendant had advised the plaintiff on the aforementioned
                    two structures which were incorporated in the agreements between Teledata and
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Teledata deal involved injection of equity into the
                plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I find that the plaintiff’s argument
                    that the defendant was precluded from claiming VAF in respect of the Teledata
                    deal, because the injection of funds accrued to Rainforest, was totally
                    unmeritorious. This is because the Teledata deal was structured in a manner
                    which benefitted the plaintiff whilst Rainforest was a mere shell. This was
                    readily apparent from the agreements between Teledata and the plaintiff. In
                    short, Rainforest was merely a conduit to achieve the end of raising funds for
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was VAF payable on the trade and supplier liabilities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The defendant had also claimed VAF (see para
                    24(4) and (5) of the defence) for its advice to the plaintiff’s management
                    in collecting receivables, on how to manage suppliers who were concerned about
                    Seagate’s termination as well as the plaintiff’s creditors. At
                    Vikas’ behest, the defendant dealt directly with Western Digital
                    Corporation, one of the plaintiff’s largest suppliers, on payment and
                    return of inventory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiff’s former chief financial
                    officer, Chay Suet Meng (“Emily”), and Nicky were cross-examined
                    on this aspect of the defendant’s claim. Emily had confirmed that the
                    defendant assisted the plaintiff to answer questions raised by vendors and had
                    advised her not to make undue preference payments to the plaintiff’s
                    creditors and suppliers. She further agreed that the defendant had to analyse
                    the plaintiff’s prospects of recoverability of trade receivables from its
                    debtors. Emily did not affirm an AEIC for her testimony. Instead, a draft AEIC
                    was presented to her in court (in exhibit P1) which she confirmed save for
                    certain amendments. The thrust of Emily’s testimony was that the defendant
                    hardly did any meaningful work (except for work done for the Meeting) so as to
                    earn the invoiced sums. I find this to be an unfair glossing over of the work
                    carried out by the defendant. In my view, Emily’s testimony may well have
                    been coloured by the fact that she is currently employed by a company (Ezy
                    Global Infotech FZE) which is largely owned by Vikas’
                family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Nicky had testified that two to three members
                    of his staff (including Dan Yock Hian (“Dan”)) were stationed at
                    the plaintiff’s office on a daily basis from mid-November 2006 to early
                    January 2007. The defendant implemented a disbursement request payment policy
                    which stipulated that the plaintiff’s management must give its approval
                    before payments were disbursed in order to avoid undue preference payments being
                    made by the plaintiff. It was also to ensure that the plaintiff made essential
                    payments such as salaries and CPF contributions and paid parties that enabled
                    the plaintiff to continue trading, such as its suppliers and
                vendors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It was also Nicky’s evidence that the
                    defendant’s staff had to manage the plaintiff’s operations in the
                    initial period of the defendant’s engagement because, at that time, Vikas
                    had apparently fled Singapore for fear of being investigated by the Commercial
                    Affairs Department of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. Whilst this
                    allegation was denied by Vikas, the undisputed fact remains that he and Emily
                    were constantly on the telephone with Nicky (as evidenced by Nicky’s
                    mobile telephone bills in exhibit D5). Vikas had 6 telephone conversations with
                    Nicky, while Emily had 40 telephone conversations with Nicky and 81 telephone
                    conversations with Dan. She had also exchanged 60 short message services with
                    them. I should add that Nicky’s evidence that Vikas spoke to him on
                    Christmas Eve of 2006 for 16.3 minutes on the Teledata deal was also evidenced
                    in exhibit D5. Nicky testified that he took the telephone call on his mobile
                    telephone because Vikas was afraid that Nicky’s land-line was
                    tapped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I find that the frequency of the telephone
                    conversations between Vikas and Emily with Nicky as well as the
                    defendant’s staff does not support the allegation that the defendant did
                    very little work for the plaintiff during the short period of the
                    defendant’s engagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     While the evidence conclusively shows that
                    Nicky did substantial work in relation to the plaintiff’s trade partners
                    and suppliers, the question remains as to whether such work entitled the
                    defendant to VAF. In resolving this issue, the parties’ intentions –
                    as evinced in the VAF Clause at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above
                    – is critical. In this regard, only (a) of the VAF Clause is relevant and
                    Nicky’s work, as discussed at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above, must have resulted in the
                    plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities being “written off,
                    extinguished, avoided or restructured” in order for a claim for VAF to
                    succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In my view, the defendant’s work in
                    relation to the plaintiff did not entitle the former to VAF. The main difference
                    between the plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities and its bank creditor
                    liabilities is that there was actually an informal standstill agreed to between
                    the bank creditors. That was the restructuring of a significant temporal nature
                    which took place in relation to the plaintiff’s liabilities <em>vis a vis</em> its bank creditors. Such a standstill did not
                    take place in relation to the plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities. On
                    the contrary, the evidence showed that the plaintiff <em>met</em> (emphasis added) its liabilities to its trade/supply
                    creditors. Whilst the defendant undoubtedly played a key role in ensuring that
                    the plaintiff met its obligations towards its trade/supply creditors, such work
                    was only compensable pursuant to the Fees Clause as no value add – as
                    defined in the VAF Clause – occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In regard to the plaintiff’s claim for
                    an Account, I had earlier held (at [33]) that it was an implied term that the defendant would be
                    liable to render an Account to the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff should have
                    requested for the same within a reasonable period after the defendant’s
                    services were terminated which, as noted earlier (at [25]), was not the case. I
                    accept in this regard the defendant’s submission that Vikas had
                    deliberately waited until after 3½ years had lapsed and the
                    plaintiff’s assets had been “hollowed out of the company”
                    before he requested for an Account. Vikas (who is funding this action) wanted to
                    ensure that the plaintiff was judgment proof before it commenced proceedings
                    against the defendant. Indeed, the plaintiff’s latest audited accounts as
                    of 31 March 2009 showed it was/is insolvent as its liabilities exceeded its
                    assets by some US$14m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As the plaintiff’s claim for an Account
                    is a claim in equity, I find that there was an inexplicable delay in making the
                    claim bearing in mind that the first time the plaintiff requested for an Account
                    was by its solicitor’s letter dated 6 August 2010, well after the
                    defendant’s second invoice had been issued on 6 February 2007.
                    Although it was not said in so many words, the defendant’s complaint that
                    the claim was not made timeously is really that laches applied and the plaintiff
                    should be denied this relief even though its claim was not time-barred. At the
                    very least, the maxim: delay defeats equities should apply to the plaintiff. Had
                    the plaintiff made its claim while it still had assets (<em>viz</em> before 31 March 2009), the defendant would have been
                    able to enforce its judgment if it succeeded in its counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I accept the defendant’s contention that
                    the plaintiff’s request and current claim for an Account was neither
                    genuine nor <em>bona fide</em> and should not now be
                    entertained. The plaintiff has nothing to lose if its claim for an Account is
                    unsuccessful. Apart from the security for costs it had furnished to the
                    defendant, the plaintiff has no assets against which the defendant can have
                    recourse to for its costs, over and above the $200,000 security. In this regard
                    Vikas’ statements under cross-examination are telling:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I found Vikas to be an untruthful witness
                    whose evidence could not be believed. I say this because he had been caught
                    lying in many other instances besides the incidents referred to at [799] and
                        <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> above. As an example, I refer to
                    another portion of his testimony where Vikas alleged that Nicky had told him
                    that Nicky had lied in affidavits filed by the defendant on behalf of Asia Pulp
                    &amp; Paper Company Ltd (“APP”) in Originating Petition No 2 of
                    2002 (see <em>Deutsche Bank AG &amp; Another v Asia Pulp &amp;
                        Paper Company Ltd</em> [2002] SGHC 257). I had pointed out to Vikas
                    that I dealt with that matter and had dismissed the bank plaintiffs’
                    application to appoint judicial managers for APP. I did not recall Nicky filing
                    any false affidavits in that case. The only affidavit he filed was to give his
                    opinion that putting APP into judicial management was not in the interests of
                    APP’s creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In contrast to Vikas’ many
                    inconsistencies, Nicky gave his evidence in a clear and forthright manner and
                    without hesitation or contradictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I find that by virtue of the work done by the
                    defendant, it is entitled to VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter in respect
                    of: (i) the bank liabilities that were successfully restructured by Nicky, and
                    (ii) the Teledata deal. The defendant is therefore awarded interlocutory
                    judgment with costs on its counterclaim for VAF. An inquiry shall be held by the
                    Registrar to determine the amount of VAF with costs of such inquiry reserved to
                    the Registrar together with interest on the VAF assessed. The VAF amount when
                    assessed shall be paid from the balance of the Deposit. The balance thereafter
                    of the Deposit if any, shall be utilised to pay any outstanding costs due from
                    the plaintiff to the defendant over and above the security for costs of
                    $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It follows that the plaintiff’s claim
                    for a refund of the balance of the Deposit is dismissed with costs. Both sets of
                    costs awarded to the defendant are to be taxed on a standard basis unless
                    otherwise agreed.</p>
