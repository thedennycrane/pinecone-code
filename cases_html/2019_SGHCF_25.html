The application was made under s 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) (“GIA”), with the Mother as the defendant. After the Guardian discovered that the Child’s name and racial group had been changed by deed poll, the Guardian’s solicitors wrote to the Mother’s solicitors on 14 December 2017 to object to the change.

In the deed poll, the Mother and the Husband had stated that they were “the lawful parents and legal guardians” of the Child. The Child was almost nine years old then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Mother gave the following reasons for changing the Child’s name. First, given that the Father’s name is not stated in the Child’s birth certificate, it is natural for the Child to take after the Mother’s name. Second, the Mother wanted the Child to have the Mother’s surname rather than the surname of the Grandmother’s Husband, who has no blood relation with the Child. Third, the Mother wanted the Child to have a greater connection to her, especially after years of being separated.

First, s 5 of the GIA does not give the court jurisdiction to hear applications by a guardian relating to the identity of a child. Parents stand at the apex of all the relationships a child has and parental authority takes precedence over a guardian’s authority. The supremacy of parental rights over those of a guardian is recognised by the GIA and disputes over “custody” between a parent and a guardian are considered differently from such disputes between parents. Second, the name of a child is a matter of parental rights in respect of a child’s identity and connection with her family. This falls outside the scope of matters that are under “custody” and is dealt with differently. The local cases dealing with changes of name involved disputes between natural parents. A guardian should not be allowed to interfere with decisions on a child’s identity. International law and case law from other jurisdictions also consider a change of name to be reflective of the identity of a child and an exercise of parental authority. Third, it is in the best interests of the Child that her name should now be changed to follow the new surname of the Mother (and step-brothers) to reflect her bond with them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.

Section 17(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SCJA confers jurisdiction on the High Court to “appoint and control guardians of infants and generally over the persons and property of infants”. But one does not simply walk into the court to ask for a grant of custody over one’s grandchild. For instance, if a grandmother disagrees with the parenting style of her daughter-in-law, she must establish her basis for invoking the court’s jurisdiction or power to grant her the custody of her grandchild. The enabling provision for the invocation of the court’s jurisdiction and power is s 5 of the [GIA], which permits only “either parent or … any guardian appointed under this Act” to make the application. <span class="font-italic">Unless she is</span><span class="font-italic"> already a guardian appointed under the GIA, the grandmother may not be able to make the application </span>(for a discussion on whether she could in limited circumstances do so, see Leong Wai Kum, “Restatement of the Law of Guardianship and Custody in Singapore” [1999] Sing JLS 432 and Debbie S L Ong and Stella R Quah, “Grandparenting in Divorced Families” [2007] 1 Sing JLS 25 (“Ong and Quah”)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The relationship between parents and their child is indeed unique. Being the ones who have brought the child into the world, absent any other party who may become involved in the upbringing of the child, parents are charged with the duty to perform that role, and are fully responsible for the well-being of the child when discharging that duty. Even when other parties become involved in the child’s upbringing, the relationship between parents and their child does not change. However, where the parents then stand <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> these other parties would have to be examined based on what the laws that govern such relationships provide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I acknowledge and appreciate the usefulness of the academic commentaries for their assistance in deciding this case. Indeed, besides the Mother, the Guardian also relies on commentaries in the same publication to support her position. I further note the discussions and the recommendations of the Law Commission Report. I have taken all these into consideration when arriving at my decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB</span>, the passage from [32] was to highlight that the jurisdiction of the court has is to be invoked before it can exercise its powers. The illustration used was that in a contest over the custody of a child between its parents and grandmother who was not formally appointed as a guardian, or accepted by the court as a guardian, the grandmother could not invoke the jurisdiction and powers of the court under s 5 of the GIA until she was so appointed or accepted. I do not think that the illustration assists the Mother in the present case where the Guardian has been formally appointed by the court as a guardian. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 To reiterate, in dealing with how the present dispute should be decided, it would be more appropriate to examine the statutory purpose of the GIA and consider the framework that it provides for resolving disputes that come within its ambit. Thereafter, the status of a parent’s relationship with a child <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the status of the relationship of other adults, including guardians, with the child, can be taken into consideration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">How questions relating to children are decided under the Guardianship of Infants Act</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Under the GIA, it is beyond doubt that the welfare of the infant is paramount when considering matters relating to the infant. This is entrenched by s 3 of the GIA, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span> Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Under this section, as between parents, neither parent is deemed to have any superior right to the other parent in matters relating to the infant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, while it is the parents who are usually charged with the duty of bringing up an infant and dealing with issues connected with it, for various reasons they may not always be present, and other parties can then become involved in the infant’s upbringing. Sometimes these other parties are formally appointed as guardians and sometimes they are not. In the latter situation, sometimes these parties are recognised as guardians despite there being no formal appointment (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin Huat Francis and another v Lim Kok Chye Ivan and another </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 392 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chin Huat Francis</span>”)), and sometimes they are not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There will also be parents who, although present, are less than ideal parents or are otherwise unable to function as parents or discharge all their duties as parents. Other parties may then become involved in the infant’s upbringing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The appointment of testamentary guardians and the requirement to act jointly</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I begin by examining the framework under the GIA when one or both of the parents are deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Sections 7(1) and 7(2) of the GIA provides that either or both parents of an infant may appoint any person to be guardian of the infant after his or her death (“the testamentary guardian”). Upon the death of the appointing parent, the testamentary guardian is to act jointly with the surviving parent of the infant so long as the mother or father remains alive, unless the mother or father objects to his so acting: s 7(3) of the GIA. This is because the surviving parent also becomes the guardian of the infant: ss 6(1) and 6(2) of the GIA. Where both parents have died, the testamentary guardians are to act jointly: s 7(5) of the GIA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Where a surviving parent objects to the testamentary guardian so acting, or where the testamentary guardian considers the surviving parent unfit to have custody of the infant, the testamentary guardian may apply to court to have custody of the infant. The court may refuse the application, in which case the surviving parent remains as the sole guardian, grant the application so that the testamentary guardian becomes the sole guardian, or order that the testamentary guardian act jointly with the surviving parent: s 7(4) of the GIA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Under s 8 of the GIA, when a dispute arises on any question affecting the welfare of an infant between two or more persons who act as joint guardians of an infant, whether between a testamentary guardian and the surviving parent, or between testamentary guardians, any of them may apply to the court for its direction. They can also apply to the court under the section to vary or discharge any order previously made under this section: s 8(c) of the GIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The sections referred to above show that in the case of an infant where one of the parents has died, the guardianship rights of the surviving parent can be circumscribed on application to court by the testamentary guardian if the guardian considers that the mother or father is unfit to have the custody of the infant. Even when the surviving parent continues as guardian, he or she has to act jointly with the testamentary guardian, and any dispute between them will be resolved by the court. The GIA does not place one party above the other, or allow either of them to decide any question affecting the welfare of the infant without involving the other.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">The application of the framework for testamentary guardians to other guardians</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I fully appreciate that the above sections govern the roles and relationship between a surviving parent and a testamentary guardian or between testamentary guardians, and that there is no express provision similar to ss 6 and 7 of the GIA which governs the roles and relationships between a parent and a guardian appointed during the lifetime of the parents of the infant. However, I am of the view that, in the absence of any express provisions to the contrary in the GIA, the same framework would also apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, while s 8 following immediately after ss 6 and 7 appears to suggest that the section applies to situations where the dispute is between persons who act as joint guardians of an infant where one or both of its parents are deceased, the language of s 8 contemplates that it is of a wider application. The section does not make any reference to ss 6 or 7 of the GIA, and its scope is not expressly limited to situations where one or both of the parents of the infant are deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I should add that this section deals with disputes between persons who “act as joint guardians” and is not limited to dealing with disputes between persons who are “appointed as joint guardians”, as the Mother seemed to suggest.

</div>
</div> There is no necessity for such a restriction as s 7 of the GIA, for example, does not require any such formal appointment, and only charges the relevant parties to “act jointly”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 5 of the GIA (see [39] above), which allows a parent or guardian appointed under the GIA to “make, discharge or amend orders for custody and maintenance of infants”, also draws no distinction between the type of guardians appointed under the GIA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, testamentary guardians or otherwise) who may apply under the section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I would add that although s 5 of the GIA does not refer to applications under the section being made only when there is a dispute between the parents or between the parents and guardians of an infant, I do not think its scope is limited to unilateral applications in situations where there is no dispute, as applications would be unnecessary in most of such situations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Sections 5 and 8 of the GIA do not set out how the provisions are to be applied in particular situations and whether how they are applied depends on who the applicant is. However, whether a parent is unable to act because he or she is deceased, or because he is not available to act or is incapable of acting, the situation faced by the infant is still the same and a framework is needed to resolve any impasse. Since the court is to have regard to s 3 of the GIA in deciding matters relating to the infant, this must mean that when a guardian appointed during the lifetime of the parents makes the application, the same framework would have to apply in dealing with that application. Otherwise, it would mean that the considerations in deciding matters relating to the infant would depend on who is applying, whether he is a parent, testamentary guardian or guardian appointed during the lifetimes of the parents. I do not think that how matters relating to an infant is decided depends on who the applicant is. To do so would be tantamount to placing the interests of the infant below that of the applicant, which is inconsistent with the mandate under s 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, whether or not parents stand at the apex of all relationships a child has, subject to s 11 of the GIA which is discussed at [68]–[69] below, the decision on matters to the child would still have to be made based on what is in the best interest of the child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I would add the following. Guardians may be appointed to act during the parents’ lifetimes for a variety of reasons. These can include the impending unavailability of the appointing parent to look after the infant, whether because he is relocating to a different country without the infant, or is suffering a physical or mental ailment that would soon render him unable to look after the infant even though he remains in the life of the infant. Whatever the reason may be for the appointment, once a guardian is appointed, he has a duty to act in the best interests of the infant as provided under the terms of the appointment until his appointment ceases, or when he is otherwise removed. That duty would have to be exercised independently of whoever it was who has appointed him. To hold otherwise would detract from the purpose of the appointment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This next part of the judgment deals with how the issue of the name change of the Child is decided, and does so based on the legislative framework provided under the GIA. It does not attempt to prescribe what the hierarchy of the relationships between parents, guardians and even non-guardians and a child should be, and should not be viewed to be doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Also, the dispute in the present case does not concern the appointment of the Guardian, but is confined to the dispute between the Mother and the Guardian over the naming of the Child. Therefore, while I have commented generally on the applicability of the framework dealing with testamentary guardians to guardians who are appointed in the lifetime of a child’s parents, I appreciate that I only need to consider whether the framework for dealing with disputes between a surviving parent and the testamentary guardian can apply to resolve the dispute between the Mother and the Guardian, who was appointed with the agreement of the Mother. The applicability of this framework to disputes involving other types of parties who are part of the life of a child will have to be decided when such cases arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Guardianship of Infants Act recognises the supremacy of parental rights over that of a guardian’s rights</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Mother argued that the GIA evidences the supremacy of parental guardianship over non-parental guardianship. This is because the appointment of guardians is to supplement the role of parents, usually in their absence. Moreover, s 6 of the GIA provides that on the death of a parent, the surviving parent becomes the guardian of a child by default, without the need for an appointment by the court. The surviving parent only needs to act jointly with the guardian appointed by the deceased parent, and his rights are not supplanted by that of the guardian’s. Disputes between the surviving parent and the guardian are resolved by the court. Further, all other provisions of the GIA limit the authority of guardians, unlike the authority of parents which is unlimited. Finally, s 11 of the GIA also mandates a hierarchy of parental authority over guardianship authority, as the wishes of the parents of a child must be considered when the court exercises the powers under the GIA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons set out earlier, I do not accept these arguments in support of the supremacy of the parental rights over the guardian under the GIA. I also do not accept that s 11 of the GIA mandates a hierarchy of parental authority over guardianship authority. The section states:

In doing so, the wishes of the child’s parents are to be taken into account when determining this. This does not mean that a parent’s wishes are the determinative factor, as the overriding concern is still the welfare of the infant. Section 11 of the GIA also does not stipulate that in a dispute between a parent and a guardian, the parent’s wishes <span class="font-italic">must</span> be preferred over a guardian’s wishes.  If the approach is indeed hierarchical as the Mother has submitted, the legislature would certainly have made this abundantly clear in the GIA. In any event, this is unlikely to be the legislative intent, as sometimes guardians are appointed because the ability of a parent to look after the welfare of a child is in doubt, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, when the parent is seriously ill and is not able to do so, or the parent has little interest in the welfare of the child. In such limited situations, the argument for the supremacy of parental rights breaks down. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin Huat Francis</span>, the Court of Appeal stated that the wish of the child’s mother for the child to be adopted by the respondents “should not be given any weight” after reviewing her involvement with the life of the child since birth, and finding that it was “unsubstantiated, having been made without consideration to [the child’s] welfare” (at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether disputes over “custody” between parents, and between parents and guardians should be considered differently</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Mother submitted that since guardianship is a legal construct, the custody rights of a guardian are defined differently from parental rights and responsibilities. The guardian is not an adoptive parent, and through an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos </span>appointment of a guardian, a parent cannot be said to have abdicated all of her rights. Accordingly, a guardian’s rights of “custody” that can be raised in an application under s 5 of the GIA must be more limited than the entirety of rights encompassed in parental rights. A guardian can therefore only make an application under s 5 for limited questions in relation to the custody of a child, and not all questions relating to the child,

</div> is not supported by case law. In fact, this view is inconsistent with the definition of “custody” adopted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 To understand what each order entails, we must first realise that, where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is divided into two smaller packages, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “care and control” and residual “custody”. In this context, residual “custody” is no longer the same concept as our general understanding of custody. Instead, residual “custody” is the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">To put it simplistically, “care and control” concerns day-to-day decision-making, while residual “custody” concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 As was appropriately summarised by Anthony Dickey in <span class="font-italic">Family Law </span>(LBC Information Services, 3rd Ed, 1997) at pp 326–327:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]t common law, care and control concerns the right to take care of a child and to make day-to-day, short-term decisions concerning the child’s upbringing and welfare. Custody without care and control (that is, custody in its narrow sense) concerns the right to make the more important, longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 In other words, <span class="font-italic">a “custody order” only gives the parent the residual right to decide on long-term matters affecting the child’s welfare. For instance, the right to decide on the type of education resides with the parent(s) with custody as it concerns the more important and long-term aspects of a child’s upbringing.</span> The right to decide the particular school may also reside with the custodian(s) depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education. However, the right to decide how a child should dress or travel to school, what sport he should take up or musical instrument he should play and similar ordinary day-to-day matters, resides with the parent who has care and control. Such a demarcation between the two types of orders proposed by Dickey is generally consistent with our local jurisprudence where matters such as choice of schools, tutors or healthcare have been regarded as matters for the custodian(s) to decide (for example, see <span class="font-italic">Yeap Albert v Wong Elizabeth</span> [1998] SGHC 97 at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Court of Appeal defined “residual custody” as matters concerning the “long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 While I note that the dispute over custody matters in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span> was between two parents, I am of the view that the definition of custody given in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span> can still provide guidance to interpret the definition of “custody” in s 5 of the GIA in a dispute between a parent and a guardian.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The changing of the name of a child goes towards the child’s identity. Since this is one of the “long term matters affecting the child’s welfare”, it would be a matter that relates to “custody” (<span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span> at [33]). Under s 5 of the GIA, which deals also with issues of custody, a guardian will be entitled to apply to the court for the determination of the name change of a child by his parent, and the court would have the jurisdiction to hear this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Third, a plain reading of the statute indicates that “custody” in s 5 of the GIA has the same definition regardless of whether a parent or a guardian applies for an order. In the absence of further clarification or specification in the GIA, the wording of s 5 implies that <span class="font-italic">both </span>a parent and a guardian can apply to the court for orders regarding the “custody for such infant”. Further, it would be logical for a court to allow a guardian to make an application to the court regarding long-term decisions for the welfare of the child, which includes the child’s identity, but ultimately leave it to the court to decide on such an application, having the welfare of the infant as the paramount consideration. Adopting the Mother’s approach would mean that the court would never be able to consider long-term decisions for the welfare of the child on the application of a guardian to court. As such, there is no reason why the plain reading of s 5 in the GIA should be departed from.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Fourth, the Mother’s submission that the guardian’s authority over the child cannot exceed the parents’ natural authority (<span class="font-italic">Elements</span><span class="font-italic"> of Family Law </span>at para 9.044) does not automatically mean that a guardian’s rights are so limited as to bar a guardian from <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">making an application</span> under s 5 of the GIA regarding the identity of the child, which is a long-term decision. In <span class="font-italic">Elements</span><span class="font-italic"> of Family Law </span>at para 9.148, Prof Leong commented that where a guardian is appointed to have full authority of a child, this order can be called a “custody” order, though qualifying that the modern understanding is that the total bundle of authority over a child is split into the residual “custody” order and the “care and control” order: see <span class="font-italic">CX v CY. </span>This suggests that there are cases where legal guardians can have <span class="font-italic">full authority</span> over a child. Moreover, there are different types of guardianship orders which bestow dissimilar levels of authority to a guardian (<span class="font-italic">Elements</span><span class="font-italic"> of Family Law </span>at para 9.045):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The authority bestowed on a guardian, flowing as it does from formal appointment, can be narrower than parental authority. The instrument of appointment can set out the time and other limits of the authority of the guardian. The guardian may be appointed to have only “care and control” of the child, or more widely, to have “custody” of the child. … while a parent exercises authority both over the person and the property of the child, a guardian may be appointed only for the “person of the infant” or for the “property of the infant”. <span class="font-italic">Appointments of guardian are, by default, appointments of guardian of the person of the infant. Such guardians step into the shoes of the parent to exercise the authority that the parent naturally possesses over the child.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the present case, the Guardianship Order did not contain any restriction on the Guardian’s authority over the Child, such as over the “care and control” order or over the “property of the infant”. This was not unexpected as the Mother was in no position to care for the Child, and was even prepared to give her up for adoption. I find that in the absence of any restriction, the default position stands and the Guardian’s appointment was that of a guardian of the infant who steps into the shoes of the parent to exercise the authority that the parent naturally possesses over the child. This necessarily entails the Guardian being able to make an application under s 5 of the GIA regarding the identity of the Child, which affects her welfare. For the above reasons, I find that the court has the jurisdiction to hear the Guardian’s application on the change of name or racial group of the Child under s 5 of the GIA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I note though that the Mother has submitted that the name of a child goes to the identity of the child, and is a parental right that is not part of the rights covered by custody. I will deal with this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the name of a child is a matter of parental rights in respect of a child’s identity and connection with the child’s family</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Local cases dealing with change of name</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In <span class="font-italic">L v L</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 529 (“<span class="font-italic">L v L</span>”), the mother who was given custody of a child after divorce changed her surname by deed poll from L to T a year after the divorce.

The evidence was to the contrary. The father had been providing for [the child]. He has also been taking an active interest in and regularly enjoying his “generous” access to [the child].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In <span class="font-italic">Khor Bee Im v Wong Tee Kee</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 55 (“<span class="font-italic">Khor Bee Im</span>”), the father abandoned his child and the mother in 1985, when the child was about eight months old, to live another woman. Parties were divorced in 1988 and custody of the child was given to the mother. She remarried in 1989, and changed the surname of the child in 1990, when the child was about five years old. When the father discovered the change in 2001, he applied to declare the change in surname null and void. The child was already 17 years old then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The High Court applied the approach in <span class="font-italic">L v L</span> and refused the father’s application, as it found that there were compelling reasons for the court to countenance the change of surname (at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Save for the payment of maintenance (at [12]), the father had shown no attachment to or desire to keep in touch with the child. Despite suggestions by the mother for him to see the child, he had only been with him once in 1990. The mother’s husband loved the child very much, and was the only father he knew (at [5]). The child had little recollection of the father, was angry and felt deserted and unloved by him, and preferred to be known by his new surname (at [7]). The child had been known by his new surname for 12 years, and all his friends knew him as such. All his school and official records also bear that surname (at [13]). It was not in the interest of the child to order his surname to be changed back as that would cause him considerable difficulties and even embarrassment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Both <span class="font-italic">L </span><span class="font-italic">v L</span> and <span class="font-italic">Khor Bee</span><span class="font-italic"> Im</span> were thus decided on the welfare principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">L v L</span>, the Court of Appeal had held at [21] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A custody order, without s 120 of the [Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) (“WC”)], would only empower the custodial parent to decide on the day to day matters relating to the child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Court of Appeal has since explained in <span class="font-italic">CX v CY</span> that the “custody order” it had referred to in <span class="font-italic">L v L</span> at [18] was one on the care and control of the child (see [30]). There is therefore no clear decision that the naming of a child is not within matters which form part of the custody of a child. Accordingly, the cases do not assist in establishing whether the naming of a child is a parental right over which the guardian has no say.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">L </span><span class="font-italic">v L</span>, the surname of a child is the symbol of his identity and his relationship with his parents (at [17]). However, I am of the view that this is not the only such symbol, as the child’s identity and relationship with his parents are also defined by his religion and the language he is brought up to use as well. Since the choice of religion can be decided by a guardian (Art 16(4), Singapore Constitution) and the language of instruction is part of “upbringing and education of the child”, which are custodial rights referred to in s 126(1) of the WC, it follows that the choice of a child’s surname is also part of the custodial rights over a child. Therefore, whether or not the choice of a child’s surname is a parental right, it is something that is to be dealt with as part of custodial rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I note that the above cases on the naming of a child concerned disputes between parents, given that it is part of custodial rights. That said, a guardian is not precluded from putting it before the court, and the same principles would then apply when deciding the issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">International law and case law from other jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Mother has referred to the first paragraph in the Declaration made by Singapore in 1995 when ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (20 November 1989), 1577 UNTS3 [1991] ATS 4/28 ILM 1456 (1989) (“UNCRC”) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Republic of Singapore considers that a child’s rights as defined in the Convention, in particular the rights defined in articles 12 to 17, shall in accordance with articles 3 and 5 be exercised with respect for the authority of parents, schools and other persons who are entrusted with the care of the child and in the best interests of the child and in accordance with the customs, values and religions of Singapore’s multi-racial and multi-religious society regarding the place of the child within and outside the family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 She also referred to cases decided in Australia on the issue of the identity of a child in relation to Article 8 of the UNCRC, which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Articles 8</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

Where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 She submitted that even when <span class="font-italic">adoptive</span> parents wish to change the name of an adopted child, the sanction of the court was necessary in the Australian cases of <span class="font-italic">Re KSE &amp; The Adoption Act 2000</span> [2006] NSWSC 92 (“<span class="font-italic">Re KSE</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Re MJR and Another</span> [2003] NSWSC 937 (“<span class="font-italic">Re MJR</span>”) . In contrast, there are no requirements for a <span class="font-italic">natural</span> parent to seek court approval to change the name of her child in Singapore. Accordingly, the Mother argued that there is no need for a natural parent, such as herself, to seek the consent of the Guardian for the name change. However, I am of the opinion that the principles discussed in the Australian cases are inapplicable to the present case. The cases of <span class="font-italic">Re KSE</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re MJR</span> concern Australian statutory requirements for the court to approve a change in the given name or names of a child on application by an adoptive parent, while the present case does not involve an equivalent Singapore statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As may be seen from <span class="font-italic">L v L</span> and <span class="font-italic">Khor Bee</span><span class="font-italic"> Im</span>, where the other parent opposes the name change, the sanction of the court is necessary. Further, having regard to the framework of the GIA that I have described above, the same would apply if a guardian who has joint custody of the child opposes the name change. So even though a child’s name is an element of his identity that he has a right to preserve, I do not think it is an issue that can be dealt with in such a straightforward manner that the Mother has submitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Having decided that the change of the surname of a child is an issue that is to be decided as part of the matters under custody of the child, the Guardian has a right to be involved in that determination, and the decision is to be based on what is in the best interest of the Child (“the welfare principle”), I turn next to consider how the issue is to be decided using this principle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether it is in the best interests and welfare of the Child to change her name</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legal position in cases on name changes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The cases on disputes in name changes that are referred to by parties are those involving parents who were once married (<span class="font-italic">L v L</span> and <span class="font-italic">Khor Bee Im</span>) or who have not been married (<span class="font-italic">TAM v TAN</span> [2014] SGDC 73 (“<span class="font-italic">TAM v</span><span class="font-italic"> TAN</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">TDI v TDJ</span> [2016] SGFC 45 (“<span class="font-italic">TDI v TDJ</span>”)). The present case, however, does not involve the Father of the Child. It is concerned with whether the Mother, who once having shared the surname of the Child but has since changed her own surname, could similarly change the surname of the Child to be the same as hers again. Notwithstanding the differences in the factual circumstances, I am of the view that the approaches in those other cases are still helpful in deciding the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The DJ stated at [13] of the GD that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is accepted that a child’s name is a symbol of the child’s identity and relationship with the child’s parents (<span class="font-italic">L v L </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 529 (“<span class="font-italic">L v L</span>”) at [17]).

</div> The Guardian argued that it is therefore not in the Child’s best interest to have to change her name after such a long time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I agree that given the length of time the Child has had Surname FF, there will definitely be an impact on her if her surname is changed to Surname DD. However, she is much younger, and has crossed fewer milestones in life than the child in <span class="font-italic">Khor Mee Im</span>, who was almost an adult and whose name appeared in his school records, examination certificates, polytechnic records, bank account and similar important documents at the time of his name change. In comparison, the Child would have fewer of such documents with her name, as she has not yet even completed her primary education. The only bank account that would be affected is the Child Development Account (“CDA”) into which money received from the Government under the baby bonus scheme is paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 However, like the child in <span class="font-italic">Khor Mee </span><span class="font-italic">Im</span>, the Child is likely to continue to mix with those who know her by her previous name: members and extended members of the Surname FF family, her teachers, classmates and friends. She is also unlikely to be living with the Mother and her family anytime soon. The impact on the Child of having to deal with all these while bearing a new surname would require careful consideration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">The importance of the surname in maintaining a link between the Mother and the Child</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The District Court in <span class="font-italic">TDI v TD</span><span class="font-italic">J</span> pointed out at [17] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An application of the “golden thread” principle [the welfare of the child is paramount], in my judgment, meant that reasons given by a parent for changing or seeking to change a child’s name or surname based on the sole fact that the name is not of the parent’s choice, or the surname is not the same as the parent’s should not by itself, without more, be determinative of whether the Court should allow or countenance such change. The maintenance of a link or bond between a parent and a child is not a mere matter of a name or surname on a birth certificate, a deed poll or indeed any other document, but also a matter of <span class="font-italic">the degree of commitment, quality of contact and existence of parental responsibility by a parent towards a child</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Mother said that the Child having the same surname as her would allow her to have a closer connection with the Child. However, while a child’s name is a symbol of his identity, it is not the only link or bond of the child to his or her parent. As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">TAM v TAN</span> and <span class="font-italic">TDI v TDJ</span>, it is not necessary for a change of surname to allow the child to know he or she is the parent’s child. If that was indeed the case, it could lead to a situation where a child has to change his surname every time his parent, who is free to change his surname anytime, decides to do so in order to preserve the parent-child connection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The link or the bond is also a matter of “the degree of commitment, quality of contact and existence of parental responsibility by a parent towards a child” (see [121] above). Thus, this is a factor which contributed to the success of the father in <span class="font-italic">L v L</span>, who had maintained a close relationship with his daughter (<span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> v L</span> at [23]), in opposing the change of her surname by the mother to that of her new husband. On the other hand, it contributed to the failure of the father in <span class="font-italic">Khor </span><span class="font-italic">Mee Im</span>, who only saw the son once in over ten years despite suggestions by the mother for him to see the child, and has shown no attachment save for the payment of maintenance, in opposing the change of surname by the mother to that of her new husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 After the Child was born in 2008, she was looked after by Mdm R and the Mother had agreed to the Child being adopted by Mdm R. When the adoption did not take place, the Mother had left the Child to be cared for by the Guardian. She also supported the Guardian’s appointment as guardian in 2011 when the Child was three years old. As can be seen from the table at [101] above, the Mother had only lived with the Guardian and Child from 2008 or 2009 in Singapore and then in Johor until 2012, when the Child was four years old. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Mother’s evidence was that she had always kept in touch with the Child after she stopped staying with the Guardian, and thought that the Child had continued her education in the Singapore school in which she was enrolled for Primary One in 2015. She said that it was only in 2017 that she realised that the Guardian had withdrawn the Child from the Singapore school a few months after her enrolment and brought her to Johor where she was enrolled in a school there which followed the Singapore school curriculum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 According to the Guardian, the Mother hardly contacted the Child after she returned to Singapore and got married in 2013. It was only in 2017 that the Mother removed the Child from Johor and brought her back to Singapore without her knowledge. Records of exchanges between the Mother and Guardian show that the Mother was aware of the withdrawal of the Child from the Singapore school as early as April 2016,

</div> As stated in [113] above, the Mother recognised that she would not be in a position to care for the Child for some time yet. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The Guardian also has mental health issues, which she said is under control. She has financial issues as well, but she seems to be able to get by, and has managed to support the Child for almost nine years. There are allegations against the quality of the care that she is giving to the Child, but that is a matter to be decided separately from the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For the immediate future, the care and control of the Child is with the Guardian, who shares a common background as the Child in the way she has been brought up for the last nine years. If the Child’s surname is changed to that of the Mother’s new surname, she remains in the same environment where she will continue to have to live in, but with a new surname. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Whether or not the care of the Child remains with the Guardian eventually, the Mother still cannot look after the Child. She has not been looking after the Child for the first nine years of her life, and had to rely on others to do so. Even in FC/OSG 250/2017, she has also not sought to have immediate care and control of the Child for herself, but applied for the Child to be put under the interim care and control of Mdm G, after earlier giving up the care and control of the Child to Big Love. It would be fair to say that until the Mother herself is able to provide care and control to the Child, her future role in the Child’s life is likely to remain the same, being that of a natural parent who keeps in touch with the Child, whether frequently, regularly or otherwise, while the Child is brought up by persons other than the Mother.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The Child will therefore continue to grow up in an environment where she is brought up by persons other than the Mother, whether it is the Guardian or someone else, be it the choice of the Mother or the court if it is called upon to intervene. Based on the evidence before me, whichever surname the Child will take after this judgment, the only real links between the Mother and the Child after today will be the blood bond between them, and the visits she can make to the Child. And if the Child takes the Surname DD that the Mother now has, this link will likely be only a symbolic one.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The wishes of the Child in the choice of her surname and name</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As stated in [25] above, besides the change of the surname, the Child was given a new middle name which is the Mother’s first name. According to the Guardian, the Mother told her that the Child wanted to keep the surname FF.

Having regard to the relationships that the parties have with the Child, I am of the view that it is more likely that the Child would have preferred to keep her old name, as the Guardian has been her only caregiver and a big part of her life for several years since she was a toddler. The Mother knew as early as April 2016 that the Child was placed in a school in Johor.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Guardian’s Affidavit dated 7 December 2017 at para 125 and p 57.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Yet she had been content to let the Guardian continue to look after the Child until 27 July 2017 when she and Mdm G brought the Child from Johor back to Singapore. The name change took place on 15 August 2017, less than three weeks later, hardly time for a close bond to be built up between the Mother and the Child for her to endorse such a major change, especially when she was only almost nine then, and would be able to form her own views on something as major as a name change.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evaluation of the factors for name changes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 A number of factors are neutral (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, how the Child got her name, and the Child not being related by blood to the Grandmother’s husband).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As stated earlier, the present case is unlike that of a mother who has custody, care and control of a child who, having married or remarried, wishes to change the surname of the child from that of the child’s father to that of her new husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I note the unique situation the Child is in. She is a child of parents from different racial groups, who took her Surname FF from the Mother and not her Father, as they were never married. She was raised as a member of a family with Surname FF from a racial group (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Race B) with whom she has no blood ties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Child’s mother (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Mother), who had little involvement in bringing her up, has married and started a family with her husband (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Husband). Instead of adopting his surname, the Mother had changed her surname to that of her own mother (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Grandmother), Surname DD. This was despite her being content to share the surname of the Child (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Surname FF), and be identified as a member of the same racial group (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Race B) for 26 years. She said that she had changed her surname to reflect her own actual heritage. However, the evidence does not support her averment that she is closer to the Surname DD family of her mother (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Grandmother). The Grandmother has already emigrated in 2011, and there is no evidence of the Mother’s contact with other family members of the Grandmother. Notwithstanding all these, I accept that it is the Mother’s prerogative to change her own surname and racial group any time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The Mother has also changed the surnames of her two sons with the Husband (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the step-brothers) to Surname DD, and wants the Child to follow suit, to discard the surname and racial group that the Child has had for the entire nine years of her life. She said this is intended to preserve the link that the Child has with her, her mother (the Grandmother) and the Child’s step-brothers. Yet, on the available evidence, it is unlikely that the Child will have close links to the Mother’s new family and her step-brothers after the change. There were minimal links between the Child and her step-brothers before 2017, and when the Child was brought back to live the family in July that year, the Mother could not cope and had to seek help from the Big Love and Mdm G just two months later. Eventually, the Child ended up being cared for by the Guardian again.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Given her circumstances, it is unlikely that the Mother will be able to care for the Child in the foreseeable future. It is also unlikely that there will be any close link between the Child and the Grandmother, her family and the step-brothers. The Child will therefore either remain in the Surname FF family circles in which she was raised if the Guardian continues to care for her, or be looked after by someone else altogether if the Guardian ceases to care for her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In the circumstances, the only substantive link between the Child and the Mother will be the blood bond between them, and the visits she can make to the Child. This is irrespective of whatever surname the Child may have. The additional link that results from the Child having a new surname (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Surname DD) and racial group (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Race A) is likely to be only a symbolic one. The sole reason for the change of the Child’s surname to that of the Mother’s new surname is therefore to create and maintain this symbolic link between her and Child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Since there will be few other links between them, I recognise the importance of preserving this symbolic link between the Child and the Mother and her relatives. However, I do not think that this should be achieved by endorsing what the Mother has done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As required by s 11 of the GIA, I have considered the Mother’s wish to change the surname of the Child. However, considering the factors listed in <span class="font-italic">TDI v TDJ </span>(see [100] above), the name change would result in the Child having to abandon the link to her heritage that she was brought up in. In exchange, there is no assurance that she will have anything to do with the heritage that her new surname and racial group are linked to. Indeed, for the immediate future, she will still be immersed in the heritage that is linked to her old surname and racial group while having a new surname and racial group. Thereafter, there is also no certainty of “commitment, quality of contact and existence of parental responsibility” (<span class="font-italic">TDI v TDJ</span> at [17]). While I accept that this may not be something which the Mother intended given her difficult circumstances, its impact on the Child will still have to be considered. The Child will also have to face all the associated difficulties incidental to the name change, which is not something that the Child would have wanted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 After weighing all the factors, I am of the view that it would not be in the best interests and welfare of the Child for her to change her surname and racial group for the reasons stated earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The link between the Mother and the Child can be preserved without abandoning the Child’s heritage from the Surname FF family, for example, by including the Mother’s new surname (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Surname DD) as part of the Child’s name, while retaining her Surname FF. There can be other options too. However, this is not within my power to order, and I can only leave this course of action for the parties to consider.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 For the reasons stated above, I agree with the DJ’s decision to set aside the deed poll and accordingly dismiss the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As stated in [65] and [66] above, this judgment does not attempt to prescribe what the hierarchy of the relationships between parents, guardians and even non-guardians and a child should be. It also only deals with the framework that is to be used to resolve the dispute between the Mother and the Guardian, who has been appointed by the Court. It does not deal with what is the framework to be used when resolving disputes involving other types of parties who are part of a child’s life.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 There is much dispute between parties on the suitability of each of the parties to be given custody, care and control of the Child, with affidavits filed by them, the Grandmother and Mdm G all stating their respective views. While I have taken into account the contents of these affidavits where they are relevant to the decision on whether the Child’s name should be changed, I wish to point out that my decision is restricted to this issue. I make no finding on any matter otherwise unless they are required for the resolution of the dispute over the Child’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 With regard to the prayers to change the racial group of the Child back to Race B, I will leave it to parties to take the necessary steps to return matters to the previous <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>. All these will have to be done within one month of this judgment, in default of which there will be liberty to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 With regard to the issue of the representation by the Husband in the deed poll that he is a guardian of the Child, there were no substantive arguments on whether this would have invalidated the deed poll. Having regard to my decision to dismiss the appeal and therefore void the change of name, I make no findings on the issue. Had I decided to dismiss the appeal as it was in the best interest of the Child to change her surname and racial group, it would always be open to the Mother to execute another deed poll for the Child even if the earlier deed poll is invalidated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Finally, given that both parties are legally aided, I make no order as to costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon  <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">David Isidore Tan Huang Loong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the appellant;<br/>Koh Tien Hua, Thian Wen Yi and Marcus Ho (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
