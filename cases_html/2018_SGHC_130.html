</div>
</div> I now set out my detailed grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The facts of the parties’ dispute are set out in detail in my judgment on liability in <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2015] SGHC 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin (HC)</span>”). They are also canvassed in the Court of Appeal’s decision on liability in <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal</span> [2016] 4 SLR 728 (“<span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiet Shoong (CA)</span>”). It therefore suffices for me to set out the background to this dispute briefly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiffs are the Wees, a family of high net worth individuals. The first plaintiff, Cheong Soh Chin, is the mother of the second and third plaintiffs, Wee Boo Kuan and Wee Boo Tee. The first and second defendants, Eng Chiet Shoong and Sylvia Lee, are husband and wife. They are experienced asset managers. The third defendant, C S Partners Pte Ltd (“CSP”), is a company incorporated by Ms Lee to provide “integrated services to families on wealth protection and wealth creation”. I shall refer to all three defendants collectively as “the Engs”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In early 2004, the parties agreed to combine their capital and financial expertise in a project they called the “WWW Concept”. The WWW Concept was intended to be a long-term and profitable collaboration for the Wees and the Engs. Under this concept, it was envisaged that the parties would find fledgling private equity (“PE”) fund managers and provide them with seed capital to start new PE funds in which the parties would also invest. They would then participate in the fund managers’ profits and also in the funds’ profits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The first step in the WWW Concept was for the parties to build a track record for themselves, in order to attract fledgling hedge fund managers. To do this, the Wees and the Engs decided to set up their own PE fund. This PE fund was to be a fund of funds, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a fund which would invest its capital in other funds. The plan was that the Wees would provide the necessary capital for the initial PE fund and the Engs would provide the financial expertise. Once the PE fund had a good track record, it would become the first fund under the WWW Concept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, in 2004 and 2005, the Wees invested US$30m in five PE funds (“Initial PE Funds”) and another US$100m in ten additional funds (“Additional PE Funds”). The Wees agreed to pay the Engs a management fee of 1.5% in respect of the Initial PE Funds. There was no similar agreement with respect to the Additional PE Funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In addition to investing their capital in these PE funds, the Wees also invested capital in five ventures which the Engs introduced to them. The ventures are known as Project Plaza, Project Sailfish, Project Red Spot, the Bahamas Fund, and the Kendall Court Fund. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Wees’ investments in the PE Funds and in these five ventures were held through a network of 24 special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”). Although these vehicles were established and maintained with the Wees’ funds, all of the vehicles were set up and controlled by the Engs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The relationship between the parties deteriorated and eventually broke down. In April 2012, the Wees brought this action against the Engs. The Wees sought, among other things, orders requiring the Engs to render an account and to return the assets which the Wees had entrusted to them. The Engs brought a counterclaim against the Wees for fees and expenses incurred in managing and administering the Wees’ investments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision in the liability phase – </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Cheong </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Soh Chin (HC)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin (HC)</span>, I allowed the Wees’ claim, holding that the Engs were indeed liable to account to the Wees and to pay to the Wees the sums which the account showed were due. I dismissed the bulk of the Engs’ counterclaim, holding that the parties were not in the relationship of a service provider and client but were instead joint risk runners working together towards the WWW Concept (at [69]). I did, however, hold that the Engs were entitled to management fees of US$450,000 per annum for the Initial PE Funds. Accordingly, I ordered the Wees to pay these management fees up to the date that the Engs transferred the structures holding these funds to the Wees (at [77]–[78]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As for the Additional PE Funds, I held that the Engs were not entitled to any management fees at all (at [81]). I held that there was no express or implied agreement that the Engs would be paid fees for the Additional PE Funds (at [83]). Additionally, I held that the Additional PE Funds were part of the WWW Concept and that the Engs had rendered their services in the expectation that they would be compensated for those services out of the eventual profits of the WWW Concept, if it succeeded. I therefore rejected the Engs’ claim that they were entitled to an award of fees on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> (at [86]–[87]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I also rejected the Engs’ claim for management fees and expenses for Project Plaza, both in contract and on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [96]–[106]). I held that the Engs were risk runners with respect to Project Plaza also, and that they expected to be compensated for their services and expenses but never took steps to negotiate and agree that compensation with the Wees. I held further that the parties had no overarching agreement under which the Wees were to meet all of the expenses incurred by the Engs in connection with Project Plaza (at [98]–[99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Lastly, I rejected the Engs’ claim for breakup and facilitation fees. I found that the Wees never agreed to pay any such fees to the Engs (at [93]–[94]). I also rejected the Engs’ claim for approximately US$320,000 for work done administering the Wees’ other investments partly on the basis there was no evidence to suggest that any such work was actually done (at [107]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Court of Appeal’s decision on appeal – </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Eng</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Chiet Shoong (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 There was no appeal against my decision on the Wees’ claim. But both parties appealed my decision on the Engs’ counterclaim. The Engs appealed my dismissal of their counterclaim. The Wees appealed my order that they pay management to the Engs fees for the Initial PE Funds beyond the date on which they demanded the transfer of the PE Funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Court of Appeal allowed the Wees’ appeal on the counterclaim. It held that the Wees had to pay management fees only up to the date on which the Wees demanded the transfer, plus a period of reasonable notice. The court took into account the payments that the Wees had already made to the Engs between 2005 and 2009 and ordered the Wees to pay management fees for three further annual periods of 2009-2010, 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 (at [103]–[105]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Court of Appeal dismissed the Engs’ appeal on the counterclaim in all respects save in relation to Project Plaza. The Court of Appeal reversed my finding that Project Plaza fell within the WWW Concept (at [62]) and held instead that the Engs were entitled to be paid A$2m for work done on Project Plaza on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> (at [86] and [92]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In all other respects, the Engs’ appeal failed and the Court of Appeal left my findings in <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin (HC) </span>undisturbed (at [93]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the reasons set out above, we allow [the Engs’ appeal] in part inasmuch as the Engs are entitled to be compensated for work done with regard to Project Plaza (albeit not with regard to the [Additional PE Funds]). <span class="font-italic">We decline to interfere with the </span><span class="font-italic">Judge’s findings on the other aspects of the Engs’ counterclaim</span>.

</div> and not simply a factual consensus reached between the parties which falls short of binding the parties as a contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Law on </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I begin by setting out the law on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The doctrine comprises three principles: (a) cause of action estoppel; (b) issue estoppel; and (c) the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or the “abuse of process” defence (<span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104 (“<span class="font-italic">TT International</span>”) at [98]). Although the three principles are distinct in application and focus, they are founded on two main considerations. The first is the public interest in achieving and upholding finality in litigation. The second is a party’s private interest in not being vexed twice in respect of the same matter (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [98]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In addition, the three principles can be broadly placed in two categories (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [105]). In the first category are the principles which apply where a point <span class="font-italic">has been</span> <span class="font-italic">previously determined</span> as between the parties by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the second category is the principle that applies where a point <span class="font-italic">has not been</span> <span class="font-italic">previously raised </span><span class="font-italic">for determination but ought to have been</span> in earlier proceedings between the same parties before a court of competent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I examine these two categories in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Category one: cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the first category, we have cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel. These two types of estoppel are similar in that they apply to prevent a party from raising a point that has been previously determined against it. The similarities between the two types of estoppel are evident from the significant overlap in the elements which a party who seeks to rely on either type has to establish. Those elements are as follows (<span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi v Koh Kim Seng and another </span>[2015] SGHC 175 (“<span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi</span>”) at [40] and [54]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there must be identity of cause of action (for cause of action estoppel) or of subject matter (for issue estoppel).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the earlier judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, there must be identity of parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Even though the elements of the two types of estoppel overlap, the second element above shows that the focal point of each type of estoppel is different. In cause of action estoppel, the court is concerned with a “claim in the later proceedings [which] is identical to that which was determined in earlier proceedings between the same parties” (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [100]). Bearing in mind the twin policy considerations on which the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>is founded<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [25] above), the cause of action in the two proceedings will be “identical” so long as the later proceedings are founded on the same matrix of facts as had been placed before the court in the earlier proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>at [49]–[50]). The emphasis is on <span class="font-italic">substance</span> as opposed to <span class="font-italic">form</span> (<span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>at [44]), a second claim can be barred by cause of action estoppel even if the earlier claim is characterised or framed in different legal terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In issue estoppel, by contrast, the focal point is whether “some question of fact or law” was determined in earlier proceedings between the same parties (<span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [100]). Thus, even where a party advances a different cause of action in the later proceedings, the party may very well be precluded by issue estoppel from raising an issue of fact or law in those later proceedings which had been determined between the parties in the earlier proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In this regard, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) set out in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Lian Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”) what amounts to “identity of subject matter” for the purposes of issue estoppel (see also <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>at [55]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the issue raised in the two proceedings must be identical. This means that the earlier proceedings must have traversed the same ground as the later proceedings, and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision on the issue must not have changed or must be incapable of change (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the determination of the issue in the earlier proceedings must have been fundamental to the earlier decision. In other words, it must be the case that the earlier decision would not be able to stand without the determination of the issue in question (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the issue must have been raised and argued in the earlier proceedings. But issue estoppel may still apply if the issue was raised but was either conceded or was not argued (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Category two: “extended” doctrine of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the second category is the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. This is also known as the “abuse of process” defence. This principle arguably has the widest application because it can be invoked even where the cause of action or the issue raised in the later proceedings was not raised or determined in the earlier proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Given the width of its application, applying the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span> inevitably carries the risk that a party will be denied access to justice because it will be prevented from pursuing a genuine claim which it has never before pursued. The doctrine must therefore navigate the fine line between allowing a genuine claim to be litigated and preventing a party from being oppressed by repeated litigation. For this reason, the extended doctrine requires the court to examine all the circumstances of the case and to take into consideration the following non-exhaustive list of factors (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the later proceedings are in substance nothing more than a collateral attack upon the earlier decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier proceedings was not; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the later proceedings to continue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analytical framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Given the different scope and application of the three principles, it is important to ascertain which one is applicable when a litigant seeks to invoke the <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> doctrine to bar its opponent from raising a point. The court must first determine whether the point was decided earlier by a court of competent jurisdiction. In that event, cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel apply. If not, the question is whether the point ought reasonably to have been raised for decision in the earlier proceedings. If so, then the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>applies (<span class="font-italic">TT International </span>at [103] and [105]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With those legal principles in mind, I now turn to the facts of the case at hand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Can the Engs argue that there is an overarching agreement for the Wees to pay expenses?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my judgment, both cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel operate to prevent the Engs from arguing now that there was an overarching agreement for the Wees to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Engs for the Wees’ investments. The judgments in the liability phase in both <span class="font-italic">Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Soh Chin (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Chiet Shoong (CA)</span> make it clear that the issue of whether such an overarching agreement exists has been determined as between these parties by a court of competent jurisdiction, and has been determined against the Engs. The judgments in the liability phase have also determined that the Engs cannot claim these costs and expenses on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decisions in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Cheong </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Soh Chin (HC)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Eng</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Chiet Shoong (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I begin my analysis by considering how the Engs’ counterclaim was disposed of in the liability phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Engs’ counterclaim pleaded that that they had an implied agreement with the Wees that the Wees would pay the Engs “Management Fees and Related Expenses”

First, the fundamental premise of this argument is that the Engs drew a distinction between “fees” and “expenses” when advancing their counterclaim in the liability phase. I have already rejected that premise (see [49] above).

</div> In that case, a director breached the duties he owed to a company and was ordered to account to the company for the profits he had made from the sale of two vessels. In the accounting phase, the director sought to adduce evidence to establish the price at which one of the vessels had been sold. The evidence was disallowed by the trial judge on the basis that the issue of the price had been determined at the main trial and the director thus could not re-open the issue.
