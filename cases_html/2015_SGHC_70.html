<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On
29 January 2015, I gave oral judgment (“the Oral Judgment”) on the
issue of ancillaries in divorce proceedings between the plaintiff
(“the Wife”) and the defendant (“the Husband”). A copy of the Oral
Judgment is attached for easy reference. The Wife has filed an appeal
against my entire decision. I elaborate on my reasons below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody of the daughter and
care and control</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       There
are two children of the marriage: a son who is more than 21 years
of age and a daughter who is below 21 years of age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Neither
party sought any order for custody or care and control of the son.
As for the daughter, the parties agreed to joint custody over her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
Wife also asked for care and control of the daughter. The Husband
eventually accepted that the daughter preferred to stay with the Wife.
Hence, I granted both parties joint custody over the daughter and care
and control of the daughter to the Wife with reasonable access to
the Husband. Accordingly, the question of custody and care and control
of the daughter should no longer be in issue and the Wife’s notice
of appeal should not be against my entire decision on the ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
parties agreed that the value of the matrimonial assets total $23,915,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Husband held $23,055,000 worth of the assets. This included a 50%
interest in a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat. It was agreed
that the 50% interest was worth $195,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
Wife held $860,000 worth of the assets including the other 50% interest
in the HDB flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
Wife asked for 60% of the matrimonial assets if she was given care
and control of the daughter and 50% if she did not have such care
and control. I did not see why care and control of the daughter
should be a reason for giving the Wife a higher portion of the matrimonial
assets. That was a matter for maintenance. Furthermore, as mentioned
below, the Husband would be the one who would provide for the children’s
future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Husband offered to give the Wife the HDB flat and a private apartment
free from encumbrances and $1 million cash. In addition, she would
keep the assets held by her. This would work out to $3,381,668 (<em>ie</em>, about 14.14% worth of the matrimonial
assets):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It
should be noted that in the above table, the Husband had used $631,668
as the value of assets held by the Wife but this excluded her 50% share
of the HDB flat. The parties eventually agreed that the value of
assets held by the Wife, excluding the HDB flat, was $665,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
main dispute was the portion which each party was entitled to of the
total matrimonial assets. As stated above, the Wife wanted 50% to
60%. Based on the revised figures of the Wife’s assets, the Husband’s
proposal would work out to about 14.28% of the total matrimonial
assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As
stated in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> and <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> of the Oral
Judgment, I took into account various factors when I granted the
Wife 20% of the matrimonial assets. I elaborate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although
20% of the matrimonial assets for the Wife may appear low for a
28 year marriage, a large portion of the assets held by the Husband
are not liquid. These are shares in a private company which he built
up. The value of the shares is $10,314,191.20 which is a substantial
portion of the $23,055,000 worth of assets he holds, <em>ie</em>, about 44.74%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Secondly,
he had stated that he was trying to involve the children in the
business and in any event, he would provide for their future. I
accepted his assurance. Indeed, the Wife did not dispute these assertions
even though she alleged that the Husband is pursuing a relationship
with another woman and he is likely to remarry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Thirdly,
in my view, it was the Husband who built up the business. I did
not accept that the Wife helped him much in his business. According
to the Husband, he continued to build up the business after he discovered
in 2007 that she had squandered or lost in gambling various sums
of money totalling $700,000. While the Wife disputed his allegations,
the Husband’s elaboration of the contradictions in her explanations
made it clear that she was not to be believed. It is not necessary
for me to repeat here the Husband’s arguments about her contradictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Husband alleged and I accepted that her gambling habit weighed on
the Husband’s mind and the Husband could no longer rely on her to manage
their finances which she had been doing before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The
absence of her assistance to manage their finances and the fact that
she had lost substantial sums of money as he was building up the business
was material. The Husband said that the fact that she squandered
a large sum of money in 2007 almost wiped out his hard earned money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There
was also the real danger that the Wife would lose much of what was
to be granted to her to the detriment of the children. While one
could argue that the money would be hers to lose anyway, such an
argument would appear counter-intuitive when a court is considering
the interests of the children as well as the parties. Perhaps that
is why the Wife did not specifically assert that argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In
balancing the interests of the parties and the children, I was of
the view that 20% for the Wife was fair. That amounted to $4,783,000
which is still a large sum and more than enough for her to live
comfortably. Indeed, that amount includes:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a
HDB flat;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a semi-detached house;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">cash of $968,000 from the Husband
(which was erroneously stated as $1,001,332 in [11(c)] of the Oral
Judgment); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Wife’s own assets of $665,000
(which was erroneously stated as $631,668 in [11(d)] of the Oral
Judgment).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Both the HDB flat and the
semi-detached house were granted to her free from encumbrances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I
ordered the Husband to pay $2,000 per month for the Wife’s maintenance
with effect from 1 February 2015. This was the amount he had been
giving her. My reasons are stated in <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> of the Oral Judgment which I
will not repeat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the daughter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I
ordered the Husband to pay another $2,000 per month for the daughter’s
maintenance and certain specific expenses, including her school fees,
which I set out in the Oral Judgment. This was effective from 1 February
2015. My reasons for the quantum are stated in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> of the Oral
Judgment which I will not repeat. However, I will stress that the specific
expenses which the Husband is to pay for already include some items
which the Wife used to increase her claim for maintenance for the daughter
to $4,000 per month.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<b><u>Custody
of the daughter and care and control</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1_1"></a>1       There
are two children from the marriage. The son is more than 21 years
of age and neither party sought any order for custody or care and control
of the son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2_2"></a>2       I
grant joint custody to the husband and to the wife over the daughter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3_3"></a>3       I
grant to the wife care and control of the daughter with reasonable access
to the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<b><u>Division
of matrimonial assets</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4_4"></a>4       The
parties have agreed that the matrimonial assets total $23,915,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5_5"></a>5       The
husband holds $23,055,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in
an HDB flat in Jurong West.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6_6"></a>6       The
wife holds $860,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in the HDB
flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7_7"></a>7       The
wife asked for 60% of the matrimonial assets if she is given care and
control of the daughter and 50% if she does not have such care and control.
I do not see why care and control of the daughter should be a reason
for giving the wife a higher portion of the matrimonial assets.
That is a matter for maintenance and as mentioned below, the husband
is the one who will provide for the children’s future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8_8"></a>8       The
husband offered to give the wife the HDB flat and a private apartment
free from encumbrances and $1 million cash. In addition, she would
keep the assets held by her. This would work out to $3,381,668 (ie, about
14.14% of the matrimonial assets):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9_9"></a>9       I
have taken into account:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
length of the marriage of about 28 years (from July 1985 to May
2013) during which the parties raised two children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
husband’s greater financial contributions and the wife’s greater
non-financial contributions in raising the children and taking care
of the household (even if she did have a maid to help).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c"></a>(c)     However,
I do not accept that the wife contributed much to the husband’s
business which was conducted through a private company. I have also
taken into account that she did lose substantial sums of money in
gambling which the husband discovered in 2007. Her gambling habit
continued to weigh on his mind and he could no longer trust her
to manage their finances.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d"></a>(d)     I
accept the husband’s assurance that he will provide for the children’s
future even though the wife alleged that the husband is pursuing
a relationship with another woman and is likely to remarry.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_e"></a>(e)     Also,
a large portion of the assets held by the husband are his shares
in a private company. He will be allowed to keep those shares as
part of the division of matrimonial assets but they are not liquid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10_10"></a>10     The
wife wanted to retain the HDB flat. She also asked for a semi-detached
house at an address at Pavilion Place (“PP”) instead of a private apartment.
The house is the latest matrimonial home. She said she and the children
are staying in it and the husband was not. The husband’s counsel said
that sometimes the husband stays at one of his other properties, <em>ie</em>, a condominium unit but he also does
stay at PP. The relationship between husband and wife is strained.
The latest update from the husband’s counsel is that once (or twice)
a week, the husband stays at night with his mother and sister. As
the wife has care and control of the daughter and the son is also
likely to stay with the wife too, I will grant the matrimonial house
at PP to the wife and take that into account in the division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11_11"></a>11     In
all the circumstances, I grant the wife 20% of $23,915,000 = $4,783,000

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12_12"></a>12     The
HDB flat and PP are granted to the wife free from emcumbrances and
the values stated above are on that basis. Therefore, the husband
is to pay any outstanding loan secured by the HDB flat or PP. He
is entitled to retain the other assets held by him. As for the cash
to be paid to the wife, the husband is to pay $500,000 within one
month from the date of this judgment and the balance within six
months from the date of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13_13"></a>13     The
husband is to vacate PP within six months from the date of this judgment
or such other period as parties may agree to in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14_14"></a>14     Parties
are to bear their own solicitor’s costs for the transfer of the husband’s
interest in the HDB flat and in PP to the wife. Any stamp duty for each
transfer is to be borne by the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<b><u>Maintenance
for the wife</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15_15"></a>15     The
wife sought lump sum maintenance calculated at $8,000 per month
x 12 months x 17 years as orally clarified by her counsel. I see
no reason to award her lump sum maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16_16"></a>16     On
the question of periodic monthly maintenance, the wife claimed that
her monthly expenses are $8,900 per month although she calculated her
claim for lump sum maintenance based on a multiplier of $8,000 and not
$8,900 per month. She also said that she had reduced her expenses
from about $13,000 claimed in her first affidavit of means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17_17"></a>17     The
husband submitted that the wife had claimed at one time that her expenses
amounted to $6,865.95 before she increased it to $8,900 per month.
Even then, both claims included a monthly sum of $621 to pay the loan
secured by the HDB flat. As the husband was paying off that loan entirely,
the monthly payment would cease to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18_18"></a>18     I
noted that the wife was charging work related expenses of about $720
per month which should pertain to her income earning capacity instead.
Furthermore, her second list of expenses contained expenses which were
either not necessary or inflated. For example, she included $800
per month for personal development which was vague and should not
be allowed. She claimed $500 per month for personal grooming such
as physio treatment, spas and facials. This appeared excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19_19"></a>19     Looking
at the wife’s expenses in the round, I do not think that they exceed
$6,500 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20_20"></a>20     The
fact that the husband can afford to give her more is in my view irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21_21"></a>21     However,
I note that the wife has not claimed the cost of purchasing a car.
I presume this is because the husband has bought a BMW car recently for
her. I am of the view that the husband’s obligation to provide the
wife with a car is a continuing one and I leave it to the parties
to try and agree as to how he is to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
husband submitted that the wife was receiving the following:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     He
submitted that the $6,800 was more than the wife’s original list
of expenses after taking away the monthly payment for the HDB loan
and he suggested that he continue paying her the $2,000 per month
as maintenance for her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Although
it was unclear whether the HDB flat was still being rented out,
it is still an asset from which the wife may derive an income. Although the
rental market may have softened, that is the risk associated with
such an asset as the rental market may also improve. I use $2,800
per month as the income earning capacity of that flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
wife said she was earning an income of $2,000 per month as a real estate
agent. While her income may be affected by a softening real estate market,
that is also the risk associated with the nature of her work and
her income could also improve. Also, it is up to her to find alternative
or additional income. I use $2,000 per month as her own income earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In
the circumstances, I order the husband to pay the wife $2,000 per month
as maintenance for her expenses with effect from 1 February 2015. This
is the amount which he has been giving to her and he is to continue
to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<b><u>Maintenance
for the daughter</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
wife’s allegation of expenses for the daughter was haphazard. In her
first affidavit of means of 25 June 2013, she indicated at para
15 that the expenses totalled $700 per month. In para 25, she claimed
$3,000 per month for the daughter’s expenses. In the wife’s Updated
Ancillary Matters Fact and Position Sheet but said by her counsel
to be filed on 11 April 2014 (undated), the wife stated that the
children’s total monthly expenses was $1,050 per month. Then, in
submissions before me, the wife was claiming $4,000 per month for
the daughter based on a list of alleged expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
husband’s first affidavit of means indicated at para 14 that his expenses
for the daughter were $1,200 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The
husband submitted that the wife had asked for $3,000 per month for
the daughter’s expense and then increased her claim to $4,000 per month.
He offered $2,000 per month and he would also pay for the school fees
of the daughter. He did not clarify whether this included some expenses like
tuition for academic subjects and an alleged badminton coach fee
and violin classes which were part of the wife’s submissions for
$4,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I
order the husband to give the wife $2,000 per month as maintenance for
the daughter with effect with 1 February 2015. In addition, he is
to pay for her:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_a_22"></a>(a)     school
fees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_b_23"></a>(b)     any
overseas trips for exchange programs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_c_24"></a>(c)     tuition
for academic subjects;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_d_25"></a>(d)     violin
classes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1-p2_e_26"></a>(e)     badminton
coach fee, where appropriate.</p>
