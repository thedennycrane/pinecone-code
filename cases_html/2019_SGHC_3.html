collective sale of a development known as Goodluck Garden (“the Property”), pursuant to s 84A(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LTSA”). Pursuant to s 84A(2), the plaintiffs are the three persons from the collective sale committee (“the CSC”) who were appointed by the Property’s subsidiary proprietors, who had agreed in writing to sell the Property, to act jointly as their authorised representatives in connection with this collective sale application. The CSC was constituted pursuant to s 84A(1A) to act jointly on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors for the purposes of the collective sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The defendants are 13 subsidiary proprietors who filed objections to the collective sale to the High Court. They mainly contended that the present application was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>, that there was a flagrant breach of certain statutory requirements, and that the transaction in respect of the collective sale to the purchaser was not in good faith. On this last point, the defendants raised many factors to argue that this court should not approve the collective sale application pursuant to s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I heard OS 841/2018 from 12 September 2018 to 14 September 2018. At the end of the hearing on 14 September 2018, I reserved judgment. I was informed that the plaintiffs had to obtain an order in respect of the collective sale by 26 November 2018, failing which the purchaser who entered into a sale and purchase agreement to buy the Property (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sale and purchase agreement, amended as at 8 March 2018 (“the SPA”)) might treat it as rescinded.

On 20 August 2018, the defendants filed their objections to the collective sale to the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 By way of a summary, a table for the chronology of the key events has been set out in the Annex to the grounds of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In submitting that this court should not approve the collective sale application, the defendants raised multiple grounds of objection. Some of these grounds of objection had not been stated in the objections the defendants filed to the Board on 10 May 2018 and 11 May 2018. There was thus a preliminary issue whether the defendants were allowed to raise grounds of objection before the High Court that had not been raised before the Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the defendants’ multiple grounds of objection to the collective sale before the High Court (including those grounds that had not been raised before the Board), they raised the following main issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The first main issue was that the first plaintiff (“Lim”) and the third plaintiff (“Chan”) each failed to declare an actual or a potential conflict of interest before their elections into the CSC. This was because Lim has a relative and Chan has two relatives, all of whom come within the meaning of “associate”, and they each own another unit in the Property. These failures to disclose were in breach of para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Third Schedule. Accordingly, under para 2(2) of the Third Schedule, each of their elections into the CSC was void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It followed, the defendants argued, that the present application before the court by all three plaintiffs was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> as all three were to act jointly in bringing the application but they could not have done so because the elections of Lim and Chan as members of the CSC were void. Alternatively, the invalid elections were factors which assisted the defendants to show that the collective sale transaction was not in good faith (see [37(a)] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The second main issue was that there was a flagrant breach of paras 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Third Schedule because the approvals of the apportionment of sale proceeds and of the terms and conditions of the CSA were not given at a general meeting of the management corporation. Alternatively, this breach was a factor which assisted the defendants to show that the collective sale transaction was not in good faith (see [37(b)] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The third main issue was that the transaction in respect of the collective sale to the purchaser was not in good faith, and accordingly pursuant to s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), this court should not approve the collective sale application. Many factors were raised by the defendants in this regard and they were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that Lim and Chan had actual or potential conflicts of interest which were not disclosed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the approvals of the apportionment of sale proceeds and of the terms and conditions of the CSA were not given at a general meeting of the management corporation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the CSC members campaigned to be elected as a “6-man bloc”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that the CSC appointed Knight Frank as the marketing agent in undue haste and with undue preference for Knight Frank, and also failed to re-negotiate Knight Frank’s fees upon learning that no DC was payable;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) that the CSC failed to keep and/or display the minutes of three meetings;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) that the CSC failed to allow minority owners to raise valid concerns over the collective sale;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) that the CSC failed to inform and consult the subsidiary proprietors about a material change in the actual DC for the Property from the last estimate given by Knight Frank and failed to extend the closing date of the public tender; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) that Colliers’ valuation report was fundamentally flawed and the CSC could not rely on it to justify the collective sale to the purchaser.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I will address these issues <span class="font-italic">seriatim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issue of grounds of objection not raised before the Board</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 A preliminary issue was whether the defendants were allowed to raise grounds of objection to the collective sale before the High Court which had not been stated in the objections they had filed to the Board pursuant to s 84A(4).

The plain and ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of this provision is that (i) only a person who filed an objection to the Board may file an objection to the High Court, and (ii) that person may not raise grounds of objection that were not stated in his objection filed to the Board. Contrary to the defendants’ submission, s 84A(4A) does expressly restrict both the persons who may file objections to the High Court and the grounds of objection that may be raised before the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (HC)</span> would support this interpretation of the plain and ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of s 84A(4A), where the High Court remarked that “[r]aising new grounds of objections before the High Court runs contrary to the express wording of s 84A(4A)” (at [48]). Apart from this statement, there was, however, little discussion by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (HC)</span> on s 84A(4A). This was because the new grounds of objection raised before the High Court were either unsupported by evidence or were not legitimate grounds for objecting (see [49], [52]). The High Court then proceeded in its decision to consider the grounds of objection before it that had previously been raised before the Board. On appeal, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Li </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Dominic and others v Ching Pui Sim Sally and another and another matter</span> [2015] 5 SLR 989 (“<span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (CA)</span>”) did not discuss s 84A(4A).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the other hand, as mentioned, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Thomson View</span><span class="font-italic"> Condominium (HC)</span> held that s 84A(4A) does not prevent an objector from raising a new ground of objection before the High Court if, through no fault of his, it became known to him only after he had filed an objection to the Board (at [45]). In that case, the objectors only learnt of the facts concerning a new ground of objection to the collective sale sometime after they had already filed their objections to the Board stating other grounds of objection (see [44]). It was thus impossible for the objectors to have stated this new ground of objection in their objections filed to the Board. Andrew Ang J found that it would be “patently unfair” to deny the objectors the opportunity to raise this new ground of objection before the High Court based on a literal interpretation of s 84A(4A) (at [44]), and allowed the new ground of objection to be raised before the High Court. I add that it was in considering and analysing this new ground of objection that Ang J ultimately decided to dismiss the collective sale application before the court. There was no appeal from Ang J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Thomson View</span><span class="font-italic"> Condominium (HC)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At this point, I add for completeness that in <span class="font-italic">N K </span><span class="font-italic">Rajarh and others v Tan Eng Chuan and others</span> [2014] 1 SLR 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”), an argument was raised before the Court of Appeal that the objectors were precluded from raising a ground of objection before the High Court since it had not been raised before the Board (see [29]). It seems, however, that such an argument was not raised before the High Court in <span class="font-italic">N K </span><span class="font-italic">Rajarh and others v Tan Eng Chuan and others</span> [2013] 3 SLR 103. The Court of Appeal ultimately did not discuss this argument in its decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having considered all the above, I found that s 84A(4A) simply means what is conveyed by its plain and ordinary meaning: only a person who filed an objection to the collective sale to the Board (pursuant to s 84A(4)) may re-file his objection to the High Court, stating the same grounds of objection. This prevents the collective sale application process from being complicated or delayed by the raising of new grounds of objection before the High Court which should have first been raised before the Board. The onus is on the objector to first raise before the Board all grounds of objection he wishes to raise. The defendants thus could not rely on s 84A(10) (as set out at [44] above) to raise new grounds of objection before the High Court and then claim that the plaintiffs’ objection to new grounds being raised was a technical one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In this regard, the question as to whether a ground of objection raised before the High Court is the same as that before the Board is to be considered objectively and holistically. An objection filed to the Board has to clearly present the grounds of objection, in order for the applicants making the collective sale application to know the case they have to meet. On the other hand, the court should not to be too quick to construe a ground of objection raised before the Board narrowly, such as to refuse hearing a ground of objection raised before the High Court on the ground that they are not the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 However, I agreed that the High Court may consider a ground of objection which had not been raised before the Board if, through no fault of the objector, he could not have known at that time of the facts giving rise to the ground of objection. I refer to the example Ang J gave in <span class="font-italic">Thomson View</span><span class="font-italic"> Condominium (HC)</span> where objectors may discover a collective sale committee’s fraudulent concealment of wrongdoing only after they have already filed objections to the Board (see <span class="font-italic">Thomson View</span><span class="font-italic"> Condominium (HC)</span> at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Therefore, in view of s 84A(4A), the defendants were entitled to rely only on those grounds of objections which they had stated in the objections they filed to the Board and not new ones unless they could not have known at that time of the facts giving rise to those new grounds of objection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ultra vires</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I turn to consider the first main issue as to whether the present application before the court was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> (see [34]–[35] above). As mentioned, this issue arose from the defendants’ argument that Lim and Chan each failed to declare an actual or a potential conflict of interest before their elections into the CSC, arising from each of them having an associate or associates who each owns another unit in the Property. These failures to disclose were in breach of para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Third Schedule and accordingly, under para 2(2) of the Third Schedule, the elections of Lim and Chan into the CSC were void.

</div> This is different from saying that certain members of the CSC failed to disclose details of ownership by their associates. However, I also noted that in this set of objections, it was parenthetically suggested, without further explanation, that paras 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Third Schedule were breached.

Such members would thus not qualify to be the authorised representatives whom the assenting subsidiary proprietors may appoint under s 84A(2) to act jointly in connection with any collective sale application, because the authorised representatives must be members of the CSC. This formed the premise of the defendants’ <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my view, O 100 r 6 of the Rules of Court did not apply because the defendants were not disputing the jurisdiction of the High Court by reason of any irregularity in the originating summons or service thereof.

However, the application before this court would not have been a similar case of the authorised representatives failing to act jointly in bringing the collective sale application; Lim and Chan would have ceased to be authorised representatives and, hence, ceased to be plaintiffs in this application. Consequently, the second plaintiff would have become the sole authorised representative and the sole plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Accordingly, I concluded that the plaintiffs’ application before this court was not <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I add that para 10 of the Third Schedule might not have assisted the plaintiffs.

The purpose seems to be so that the Board need not invalidate any application before it simply because of a non-compliance with any requirement in the First, Second or Third Schedule. I also observed that s 84A(7C) uses the words “shall not <span class="font-italic">invalidate</span> an application”, rather than the words “shall not <span class="font-italic">approve</span> an application” which are found in s 84A(9) [emphasis added] (see also ss 84A(6) and 84A(7)). I will discuss ss 84A(7) and 84A(9) at [95] below. It thus appears that s 84A(7C) is more concerned with a threshold issue of whether an application may even be made, rather than with the subsequent issue of whether an application which has already been made shall or shall not be approved. This also explains why s 84A(7C) mentions the Board only and not the High Court, since an application is made to the Board in the first instance. The threshold issue of whether an application may even be made should thus have been settled before the Board in the first instance. Thus, the omission to mention the High Court in s 84A(7C) appears deliberate. However, the omission means that the court still has to grapple with the question as to whether a non-compliance with any requirement in the First, Second or Third Schedule would necessarily invalidate an application to the High Court for approval.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 While the LTSA scheme contains the “minimum standards of conduct” that form the “baseline” below which the majority owners will not be permitted to descend (<span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens (CA)</span> ([49] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (CA)</span> at [40]), it seemed to me that a non-compliance will not, in and of itself, necessarily invalidate an application to the High Court even if the non-compliance is not of a merely technical provision (see <span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens (CA)</span> at [54]; <span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (CA)</span> at [52]). This will accord with the framework in s 84A(7C) regarding an application to the Board. Indeed, that was what I believed the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Gilstead</span><span class="font-italic"> Court (HC)</span> was saying when it referred to this provision at [51]. The High Court also cited the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard and others</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 597 at [35] for the proposition that the court should not allow a “truly technical objection” to frustrate a collective sale application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Strictly speaking, s 84A(7C) does not apply to an application made to the High Court.

Thus, in our view, the duty of good faith under s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) requires the [collective sale committee] to discharge its statutory, contractual and equitable functions and duties faithfully and conscientiously, and to hold an even hand between the consenting and the objecting owners in selling their properties collectively. <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">particular, [a collective sale committee] must act as a prudent owner to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the entire development</span>. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The duties of a collective sale committee include, and are not limited to (<span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [134]; <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the duty of loyalty or fidelity;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the duty of even-handedness;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the duty to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the duty to make full disclosure of relevant information; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the duty to act with conscientiousness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In assessing whether the collective sale transaction is in good faith, the court will take into account only three circumstances: (a) the sale price (s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(A)); (b) the method of distributing the proceeds of sale (s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(B)); and (c) the relationship of the purchaser to any of the subsidiary proprietors (s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(C)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In taking into account the sale price for the test of good faith, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> held that the word “transaction” in s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) (at [130]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… embraces the entire sale process, including the marketing, the negotiations and the finalisation of that sale price (all of which steps ought to be evaluated in the context of prevailing market conditions), culminating in the eventual sale of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Ultimately, the test of good faith is concerned with whether the sale price was the best price reasonably obtainable in the prevailing circumstances, or as the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> framed it, whether the sale price was <span class="font-italic">appropriate</span> in the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> at [59], [61(c)]). The Court of Appeal chose to frame the test as such because “determining what the best price is can entail a theoretical inquiry” (at [61(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In determining whether the sale price was appropriate in the circumstances, all the facts of the case must be appraised in the round.

This follows because, as was noted in [<span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>] itself at [131], ‘good faith’ under s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(A) of the LTSA entails considerations of good faith as a matter of common law and equity; this usually entails a finding of <span class="font-italic">some want of probity on the part of the relevant parties</span>, although this can be inferred from aspects of the transaction itself.

</div>
</div> The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cairnhill</span><span class="font-italic"> Heights (HC)</span> was otherwise silent on this issue of burden of proof. I add that <span class="font-italic">Cairnhill</span><span class="font-italic"> Heights (HC)</span> was decided before the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 On the other hand, the defendants said that the burden of proof was on the plaintiffs to prove that the transaction was in good faith. The defendants relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> where the Court of Appeal was of the view at [200] that the Board had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the objectors. The Court of Appeal said that once <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of bad faith is produced by the objectors, the applicants have the task of disproving such bad faith and establishing that the transaction is in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Court of Appeal’s statement has to be understood in its context. First, the Court of Appeal was specifically considering the issue of whether there was a potential conflict of interest that impugned the good faith of the transaction before it. Second, the Court of Appeal was considering the role of a Board in determining collective sale applications. Unlike the Board’s present role in receiving collective sale applications, at the time of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>, the Board determined collective sale applications by mediation-arbitration pursuant to s 89(2) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (Act 47 of 2004). The Court of Appeal also held that the Board had a “significant inquisitorial role to play” (at [173]), and also that pursuant to reg 18(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005 (S195/2005), the Board was not bound to apply the rules of evidence applicable to civil proceedings in any court but could inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thought fit. It was in the light of this backdrop that the Court of Appeal held at [173]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Ultimately, the applicants must adduce sufficient evidence to convince the [Board] that the transaction was in good faith. For example, in cases where <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of a potential conflict of interest has been adduced, the applicants must in turn produce sufficient evidence to disprove that conflict of interest (assuming this can be done) or to prove that such conflict is not material, and satisfy the [Board] of the good faith of the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In coming to its decision that the Board had wrongly placed the burden of proof on the objectors, the Court of Appeal also cited s 113 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) but it seems that this was <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> as it appears that neither party before the Court of Appeal had relied on that statutory provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Section 113 of the Evidence Act states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proof of good faith in transactions where one party is in relation of active confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">113.</span> Where there is a question as to the good faith of a transaction between parties, one of whom stands to the other in a position of active confidence, the burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is on the party who is in a position of active confidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) The good faith of a sale by a client to an attorney is in question in a suit brought by the client. The burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is on the attorney.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) The good faith of a sale by a son just come of age to a father is in question in a suit brought by the son. The burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is on the father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 On the one hand, it could be argued that when s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) refers to the situation where the transaction is not in good faith, “the transaction” here is not confined to the transaction as between the subsidiary proprietors and the purchaser but includes the overall process leading to the eventual transaction to sell to a purchaser. It seems that the legislative scheme where a collective sale application requires the approval of the High Court is just as concerned, if not more concerned, about the competing interests between the assenting and the dissenting subsidiary proprietors as it is about the competing interests of the subsidiary proprietors as a whole and the purchaser. One could also argue that, through the collective sale committee, the assenting subsidiary proprietors are in a position of active confidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the dissenting subsidiary proprietors and therefore s 113 of the Evidence Act requires the plaintiffs, who represent the assenting subsidiary proprietors, to establish good faith in the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 On the other hand, s 113 of the Evidence Act seems to contemplate “the good faith of a transaction between parties” where the parties are on the opposite ends of the transaction, as the illustrations in s 113 demonstrate this, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a sale by a client to an attorney (illustration (<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) and a sale by a son just come of age to a father (illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). In the present case, the transaction was the collective sale of the Property and that transaction was between the subsidiary proprietors and the purchaser. It was not between the assenting and the dissenting subsidiary proprietors, or between the CSC and the dissenting subsidiary proprietors. Furthermore, the plaintiffs are the authorised representatives of the assenting subsidiary proprietors and they represent those subsidiary proprietors, and not the CSC as such. It was doubtful that the assenting subsidiary proprietors are in a position of active confidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the defendants. In my view, this seemed to be the more persuasive argument. I add that s 113 of the Evidence Act which predates the collective sale scheme under the LTSA was not drafted with such a scheme in mind, and it may be that this scheme under the LTSA was also not drafted with s 113 of the Evidence Act in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Thus, in my view, s 113 of the Evidence Act does not apply here in respect of the question of good faith under s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the LTSA. Nevertheless, I was of the view that the legal burden was on the plaintiffs to establish that the transaction was in good faith for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As the plaintiffs were seeking a court order for the collective sale under s 84A(1), then as a matter of general principle, it should be they who had the burden of persuading the court to grant the order. This was reinforced by s 84A(10) (set out at [44] above) which applies where no objection has been filed to the High Court. In that event, the determination of good faith under s 84A(9) is to be made by the court on the basis of the facts available to it. If the legal burden of proof were not on the plaintiffs, then it would follow that the court will grant the order for the collective sale whenever no objection has been filed. However, s 84A(10) suggests that that does not necessarily follow. The court may still decide not to grant the order for the collective sale on the facts available to it. This points to the legal burden being on the plaintiffs all the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 From the practical point of view, it will ordinarily be the case that in contested applications, objections will be filed. The objectors adduce the evidence to support the allegations of bad faith, and if that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of bad faith, then the applicants have to counter such allegations with evidence and/or arguments of their own (see <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [200]). However, the legal burden remains with the applicants to establish that the collective sale transaction is in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 As for the statutory language of s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), that “[t]he High Court … shall not approve an application made under subsection (1) if the High Court … is satisfied that the transaction is not in good faith”, I was of the view that it is equivocal on the question as to which party has the burden of proof in respect of good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I come now to the factors which the defendants raised to allege bad faith, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the transaction in respect of the collective sale to the purchaser was not in good faith. I will refer to them as sub-issues. However, one should also bear in mind that the defendants did not allege that there was bad faith on the part of any individual person or entity specifically, whether in the CSC, Knight Frank or R&amp;T.

Hence, for present purposes, it is sufficient if I refer only to the requirements to disclose conflicts of interest for a candidate standing for election into a collective sale committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 A collective sale committee candidate has to declare any actual or potential conflict of interest “<span class="font-italic">if any</span>, with his duties or interests as a member of the collective sale committee” [emphasis added] (para 2(1)). Such conflict of interest may arise from, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, his possession or ownership of any lot in the strata development (para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)), or his associate’s possession or ownership of any lot in the strata development (para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 By way of legislative history, para 2 of the Third Schedule was the result of an amendment introduced by way of the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act 13 of 2010). I will call this particular amendment, “the 2010 amendment”, and para 2 as it was prior to the 2010 amendment, “the previous para 2”. The previous para 2 only stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Disclosure of interests</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. A person standing for election as a member of a collective sale committee who has any direct or indirect interest in any property developer, property consultant, marketing agent or legal firm, being an interest that could conflict with the proper performance of his functions as a member of a collective sale committee (should he be elected) shall, as soon as practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge, disclose the nature of that interest at a general meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The previous para 2 concerned a candidate’s duty to disclose a particular type of conflict of interest before his election. Nevertheless, at the time when the previous para 2 was in operation, the duty to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest was not confined to that stated in the previous para 2. The Court of Appeal decided <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> when the previous para 2 was in operation. It held that at general law, there was a duty to disclose any conflict of interest even if it was not of the kind specifically listed in the previous para 2 or if it arose after the candidate’s election into the collective sale committee (see [152]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The previous para 2 was amended in various significant ways by the 2010 amendment (see the explanatory statement relating to the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill (Bill 9 of 2010) at p 32). For present purposes, I mention a few.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 First, the previous para 2 was amended to elaborate on the kind of circumstances from which an actual or a potential conflict of interest may arise for a candidate. As mentioned at [134] above, these circumstances now include his or his associate’s possession or ownership of lots in the strata development. It is also important to bear in mind that although, for example, para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) specifically identifies the candidate’s ownership of a lot, whether alone or together with any of his associates, as one such circumstance to be considered, it does not say in terms that this circumstance would necessarily give rise to an actual or a potential conflict of interest. Likewise, para 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) does not say in terms that the ownership of any lot by an associate in the same strata development necessarily gives rise to an actual or a potential conflict of interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Second, the previous para 2 was amended to expressly state that the candidate’s obligation to declare any actual or potential conflict of interest that he becomes aware of is a continuing one even after his election into the collective sale committee (see para 2(3)). I add here that the expression for the knowledge requirement was changed from the phrase “as soon as practicable after the relevant facts have come to his knowledge” in the previous para 2, to the phrase “aware of” in paras 2(1) and 2(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Third, the previous para 2 was amended to state that a candidate’s failure to declare any actual or potential conflict of interest he was aware of before his election would void his election (see para 2(2)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 When explaining the 2010 amendment in relation to conflicts of interest which may arise from ownership of a lot by a candidate or his associate, Mr K Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, explained (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 379):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Hereafter, it is proposed that candidates will also be required to declare the extent of ownership they have in the strata development. In addition, they will have to declare any ownership interests held by connected persons related to them. Such connected persons will include immediate family members as well as companies in which the candidate and/or his family collectively hold more than 5% voting power. The aim of this additional disclosure requirement is to enhance the transparency of the sales committee election process and help other owners make a more informed decision on whom they should elect to their sale committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The defendants referred to the Minister’s explanation for their submission that declaration of the fact that an associate owns another unit must be made. Because the Minister did not discuss the “awareness” element (see [139] above), the defendants also contended that there was no scope for the argument that declaration is only required when a candidate believes he has any actual or potential conflict of interest.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 It seemed to me that it was arguable that the Minister’s explanation went even further than the defendants’ submissions if considered at face value only. The Minister’s explanation suggested that a candidate was to declare the extent of his ownership in the strata development even if he owned only one unit. The first part of the Minister’s explanation did not say that a candidate was to declare the extent of his ownership only if he owned more than one unit. “In addition”, a candidate was to declare the extent of ownership of “connected persons” related to him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “associates”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Minister’s explanation deserved further consideration. Two questions arose:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does ownership by a candidate and/or his associate of a lot in a strata development in and of itself conflict “with [a person’s] duties or interests as a member of the collective sale committee”?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If so, what would the candidate then have to declare under his obligation to declare “the nature and extent” of such conflict of interest?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In this regard, I turn to the consider the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> which extensively discussed the collective sale committee member’s duty to disclose conflict of interest (or more specifically, his duty to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest and his duty to make full disclosure of relevant information). This decision was rendered before the 2010 amendment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As mentioned, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> held that a collective sale committee member has a duty to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest. However, the Court of Appeal did not have to decide what exactly constitutes a potential conflict of interest. The Court of Appeal noted at [142] that the position was not yet settled in Singapore whether the test for a potential conflict of interest should be a test of “mere possibility” of conflict or the less strict test of a “real sensible possibility” (the former was favoured by the majority in the UK House of Lords case of <span class="font-italic">Boardman </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Phipps</span> [1967] 2 AC 46, while the latter was crafted by Lord Upjohn in his dissenting judgment in that case). The Court of Appeal however accepted in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> that it was arguable that the stricter approach is preferable for three reasons (at [142]–[145]): (i) there is the need to extinguish all possibility of temptation that a collective sale committee member may abuse his position and to deter him from so doing; (ii) there is the difficulty of inquiring into a person’s state of mind or motives and ascertaining whether he has an actual conflict of interest; and (iii) there is the difficulty of detecting an actual conflict of interest given the ease with which he may conceal it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 As for the duty of full disclosure, the Court of Appeal explained at [147]–[148]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">147 The fiduciary must disclose the personal interest as soon as a possible conflict arises, or as soon after as practicable. An ‘interest’ may be constituted by ‘the presence of some personal concern of possible significant pecuniary value in a decision taken, or transaction effected, by a fiduciary’ … It may be an interest which is not yet fully realised …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">148 In an adversarial trial, the burden of <span class="font-italic">proving full disclosure</span> lies on the fiduciary … <span class="font-italic">Mere disclosure that he has an interest or the informal making of statements that might put a principal on enquiry is not sufficient.</span> It is also not enough to prove that had the fiduciary asked for permission, it would have been given … In an application before [a Board], the burden should not be any less on the [collective sale committee]. It entails <span class="font-italic">full disclosure</span> to the objecting owners as well as the [Board].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Because of the factual matrix before it, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> also specifically mentioned in relation to the duty to disclose conflict of interest (at [152]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [a collective sale committee] member who <span class="font-italic">acquires additional units in the strata development (especially if they are financed by bank loans)</span> before or after he becomes a member of the [collective sale committee] <span class="font-italic">must disclose such interest</span> to all the subsidiary proprietors including the objecting owners. [original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I will set out the facts in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>. In doing so, I will draw from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> (at [60]–[61]) which was given after the 2010 amendment. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> generally affirmed its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> (as mentioned at [99] above) and also explained how that judgment should be approached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>, the collective sale committee decided to sell the property to a developer at the reserve price despite: (i) a suggestion from a collective sale committee member to seek the consenting subsidiary proprietors’ approval to do so, given that property prices had suddenly risen quite sharply; (ii) the collective sale committee’s knowledge that it would not obtain such approval; and (iii) the presence of other potential offers, including a letter of offer to purchase the property for a higher price. Also, adopting the Court of Appeal’s description in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> (at [60(b)]) of the facts in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Two members of the sale committee in that case, one of whom was the chairman, <span class="font-italic">had purchased additional units with the assistance of substantial financing in the period leading to their appointment</span>, but this was not disclosed prior to the committee’s decision to go ahead with the sale of the property. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Against this background, on the failure of these two collective sale committee members to disclose their “possible if not actual conflict[s] of interest”, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> (at [61(a)]) explained that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In [<span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>], there was such a concern over <span class="font-italic">a possible conflict of interest by virtue of the fact that certain</span><span class="font-italic"> members had made additional purchases of units in the lead-up to their appointment to the sale committee and had not made any disclosure of this fact</span> prior to the decision to sell the property. The fact that those members elected not to testify to explain their non-disclosure suggested to the court that there was no reasonable explanation for the <span class="font-italic">hasty</span> decision to sell the property and that the conflict of interest had influenced their decision. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 To summarise, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> held that the two members’ potential conflicts of interest “[arose] from their purchase of additional units in the Property on bank financing” in the lead-up to their appointment to the collective sale committee (see <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [188]). This conflicted with their duties as collective sale committee members because the reasonable inference was that such a purchase “had created an urgency on their part to sell the Property as quickly as possible”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Decision on the sub-issue of conflict of interest</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In response to the question I raised at [144(a)] above, I was of the view that ownership by a candidate and/or his associate of a lot in a strata development does not in and of itself necessarily raise an actual or a potential conflict with his duties or interests as a member of the collective sale committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The terms of the relevant statutory provision, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, para 2(1) of the Third Schedule, are paramount. As set out at [132] above, it states that if a candidate is “aware of any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest, <span class="font-italic">if any</span>, with his duties or interests as a member of the collective sale committee” arising from the listed circumstances, he has to declare the nature and extent of all such actual or potential conflicts of interest [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The phrase “if any” is important. In my view, it means that the mere fact that a candidate owns a unit or his associate owns another unit does not necessarily mean that there is an actual or a potential conflict of interest. Otherwise that qualification “if any” is otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Moreover, pursuant to para 1(3) of the Third Schedule, a candidate would be someone who is a subsidiary proprietor, or a nominee for election by a subsidiary proprietor which is a company, or a member of a subsidiary proprietor’s immediate family who is nominated for election by that subsidiary proprietor. <span class="font-italic">If</span> mere ownership of a unit raised an actual or a potential conflict, every candidate would necessarily have an actual or a potential conflict of interest before his election into the collective sale committee (see the meaning of “associate” under para 2(3)). Every candidate would then, as a matter of course, always have to declare before his election the nature and extent of his conflict of interest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the nature and extent of his or his associate’s ownership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> did not take the approach that with para 2 (the result of the 2010 amendment), every candidate would necessarily have an actual or a potential conflict of interest and would always have to declare before his election the nature and extent of his or his associate’s ownership. First, in generally affirming its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> and explaining how that judgment should be approached, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> did not suggest that the 2010 amendment affected the analysis in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> on the issue of whether the collective sale committee members had any actual or potential conflicts of interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Second, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span> made an effort to explain how in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> the two members’ potential conflicts of interest arose from their <span class="font-italic">purchase of additional units</span> (i) with the assistance of <span class="font-italic">substantial </span><span class="font-italic">bank financing</span> and (ii) in the <span class="font-italic">lead-up to their appointment</span> to the collective sale committee (see [150]–[151] above). As mentioned at [152] above, because of these two factors, the two collective sale committee members likely had an urgency to sell the strata development as quickly as possible. This thus potentially conflicted with their duty to act with conscientiousness to obtain the best sale price reasonably obtainable (see <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [188]), and thus their duties as members of a collective sale committee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 This reasoning shows that mere ownership does not in and of itself necessarily raise an actual or a potential conflict of interest. This should be the case unless there is some reason to suggest otherwise, like the two factors in the case of the two collective sale committee members in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>. To be clear, a candidate’s mere ownership of a unit does not raise a potential conflict whether on the test of “mere possibility” of conflict or on the test of a “real sensible possibility”. By extension, an associate’s mere ownership of a unit also does not in and of itself necessarily raise an actual or a potential conflict with the candidate’s duties or interests as a collective sale committee member.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Therefore, while disclosure of the nature and extent of a candidate’s ownership or the existence of ownership by an associate would provide more information to subsidiary proprietors, that disclosure is not mandated by the LTSA unless there is an actual or a potential conflict of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Accordingly, the question posed at [144(b)] above was academic in the present circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Was there any evidence of an actual or a potential conflict other than the fact of the ownership of a unit by an associate?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The defendants submitted that the associates of Lim and Chan own the same type of unit as them, resulting in what would appear to be an overrepresentation of that type of unit on the CSC. I accepted that the defendants could not have raised this ground of objection before the Board because the plaintiffs only answered on 7 August 2018 that Lim and Chan have associates who each owns another unit of the same type as them. This answer came after the defendants had filed their objections to the Board. I thus proceeded to consider this ground of objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In my view, there was no suggestion that the apportionment of sale proceeds was unfair. Just as the mere fact of an associate’s ownership of another unit is insufficient to give rise to an actual or a potential conflict of interest, the mere fact that that other unit is of the same type is also insufficient. Since the LTSA does not regulate the composition of a collective sale committee, Lim and Chan also did not have to declare before their elections that their associates own the same type of unit as them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I also did not find that Lim and Chan had or potentially had extra interest and urgency to push through with the collective sale as quickly as possible solely by virtue of the fact that they have associates who each owns another unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Therefore, I found that Lim and Chan had no conflict of interest to declare before their elections, and they did not have to declare that they have associates who each owns another unit. However, they should have done so to avoid unnecessary suspicion especially when questions about such ownership by associates had been raised specifically at the EGM on 9 September 2017. I will elaborate on this point later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 If I were wrong on the point that Lim and Chan had no conflicts of interest to disclose, their conduct should be considered further. They said they relied on legal advice that there was no actual or potential conflict of interest on their part. This was not disputed. I was of the view that they were entitled to rely on legal advice even if that advice turned out to be wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In the circumstances, I accepted that even if Lim and Chan were obliged in law to disclose the fact of ownership by their associates, the omission to do so was based on legal advice. That omission, as well as the omission by the plaintiffs’ lawyers to answer questions raised by the defendants’ lawyers concerning the question of ownership of units by associates (see [130] above), was not evidence of bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Further, even if Lim and Chan each had a duty to declare the ownership by their associates because such ownership would mean that Lim and Chan each had an actual or a potential conflict of interest, their non-disclosure would not necessarily have meant that the collective sale transaction was not in good faith. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [151] (and affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens (CA)</span> ([49] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… any non-disclosure of a conflict of interest … may affect the requirement of good faith in the transaction, especially if the [collective sale committee] member has played a decisive, influential or leading role in [a collective sale committee]’s decision to enter into the transaction. Each case of a failure to disclose a conflict of interest must be examined closely to determine the significance and consequences of the breach in relation to the transaction as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Additional remarks</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 That said, I agreed that the matter should have been better handled by Lim, Chan and R&amp;T, the lawyers for the CSC who also acted for the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I asked the plaintiffs at the hearing as to why the CSC and R&amp;T took the risk of choosing not to disclose the ownership by the associates of Lim and Chan when specifically questioned on this matter at the EGM on 9 September 2017.

</div> it was recorded that two subsidiary proprietors had asked what “conflict of interest” meant when the Third Schedule required the CSC to declare conflicts of interest. One of them mentioned that the conflict of interest declaration should be pasted at prominent spots of the Property. A third subsidiary proprietor specifically asked whether the CSC members have associates who own other units. Of these three subsidiary proprietors, only one of them is a defendant in the present application.

</div> It was unfortunate that the CSC members appeared not to have considered the matter more carefully by themselves. It appeared that they had simply accepted their lawyers’ advice without question. While, in principle, they were entitled to rely on their lawyers’ advice, the CSC members should have questioned the validity of the advice in the circumstances in the light of questions being raised and of the clear terms of paras 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and also para 7(2). A collective sale committee cannot simply delegate its duties to its professional advisers or simply rely on the advice given to excuse any lapses in respect of its duties (see <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [160], which discussed valuers specifically). Be that as it may, the breach of the relevant provisions was caused by R&amp;T. It was not evidence of bad faith on the part of the CSC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 It is true that s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is concerned with whether “the transaction is not in good faith”, and a finding that the transaction is not in good faith does not necessarily need to be confined to the conduct of the collective sale committee alone but may take into account the conduct of its professional advisers too (see <span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> ([49] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45], [52]). In any case, the collective sale committee’s professional advisers are also its agents for the purposes of the collective sale (see <span class="font-italic">Harbour View Gardens</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [45]). However, while it was regrettable that the legal advice provided here was obviously wrong, I did not conclude that R&amp;T acted in bad faith in giving this wrong legal advice to the CSC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I added that I was not persuaded that there was prejudice to any subsidiary proprietor. Despite the unsatisfactory state of affairs where the subsidiary proprietors, especially the minority owners, were deprived of their entitlement to vote on the apportionment of sale proceeds and on the terms and conditions of the CSA at the EGM, it was not disputed that a simple majority of the subsidiary proprietors who attended the EGM signed the CSA that day, after the EGM was concluded. Furthermore, although there had been a suggestion prior to the EGM that some subsidiary proprietors might not attend the EGM if they thought that there would not be any voting on the various aspects of the CSA,

All the six subsidiary proprietors who stood as a team were elected into the CSC. Even if one of them was not elected, that would not necessarily mean that the rest of the team who were elected would have to decline their elections unless they specifically said that they would so decline in that event.

</div> Accordingly, there was no need for the CSC to convene another general meeting of the management corporation to appoint Knight Frank as the marketing agent. This was consistent with para 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Third Schedule. Since the subsidiary proprietors would then not be appointing the marketing agent at another general meeting, there was thus no need for the CSC to provide to the subsidiary proprietors information on the competing proposals from the other marketing agents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 There was no suggestion by the defendants that the CSC’s initial expectation of a sale price of $500m was untrue or was too low at the time it appointed Knight Frank as the marketing agent. Furthermore, Knight Frank’s terms of remuneration were on a tiered basis meaning that its fees would be proportionately higher only if a sale price higher than $550m was achieved. The fees for the other two potential marketing agents were higher if the sale price did not exceed $550m.

The CSC (and the subsidiary proprietors) would have very much needed Knight Frank’s expertise in advising on the next course of action in the collective sale process and acting quickly, if the need arose, at that time. It would hardly be reasonable, let alone prudent, for the CSC to have attempted to re-negotiate Knight Frank’s fees at such a critical time. On the contrary, if the CSC had attempted to re-negotiate Knight Frank’s fees at such a time, an objection might validly be raised that the CSC had distracted itself and the marketing agent from focusing on doing what was necessary to obtain the appropriate sale price in the circumstances. The defendants’ argument that the CSC ought to have re-negotiated Knight Frank’s fees at that time did not reflect well on the defendants.

That said, it is not easy to urge restraint when emotions run high. It was difficult for me to find that the CSC breached its duty of even-handedness when conducting the various meetings or in their various modes of communication with the subsidiary proprietors.

The amount of each estimate increased, from an initial estimate of $48.4m to the third and last estimate of $63.19m. Knight Frank had also alerted the subsidiary proprietors about the likelihood of an increase in the DC rates from 1 March 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Knight Frank and the CSC did not wait for a formal response from URA to obtain the DC verification, before the Property was launched for sale on 26 January 2018. Knight Frank had earlier appointed Ong &amp; Ong to make the relevant searches to obtain the DC verification but Knight Frank and the CSC did not wait for the outcome. Instead, soon after the consent threshold of the subsidiary proprietors of lots with not less than 80% of the share values and not less than 80% of the total area of all the lots was reached, the Property was launched for sale by way of public tender on 26 January 2018, with the outcome of the DC verification pending.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 As it turned out, URA sent a reply letter dated 26 February 2018, to Ong &amp; Ong. A copy was sent to the CSC who sent it to Knight Frank. The letter contained information which revealed that no DC was in fact payable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Knight Frank immediately began updating potential bidders in various ways. In urgent discussions between Knight Frank and the CSC, Knight Frank advised the CSC not to extend the closing date of the tender, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 7 March 2018 and the CSC did not disagree (see [21] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 In the meantime, Colliers had also been appointed to give an independent valuation of the Property as at 7 March 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 On that date, the tender box was opened. There were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) one expression of interest at $480m;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) one bid at $580m; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a second bid at $610m. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Colliers’ report was also opened.

I add that regardless of the correctness or incorrectness of Knight Frank’s methodologies for estimating the DC, the fact of the matter was that Knight Frank was way off in its assessment of the actual DC. Knight Frank’s third and last estimate to the subsidiary proprietors on 25 January 2018 had been $63.19m when there was in fact no DC payable.

</div> The Court of Appeal, in describing the facts of that case, remarked at [12] that the DC (which was factored into the sale price) had been “grossly over-estimated by some $6.6m”, where the actual DC of $950,894 was “a startling 87% difference from the original estimate of $7.6m”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Obtaining the DC verification before the launch of the Property for sale</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Should Knight Frank have obtained the DC verification before the launch of the Property for sale? Leaving aside the evidence for the time being, I would have thought that, as a matter of general principle, such important information should logically be obtained first before a sales launch so that subsidiary proprietors are making an informed decision as to what reserve price to set and also eventually what price to accept. Also, even though I accepted that the reserve price is not likely to influence the bid price from potential bidders, the DC itself does influence the bid price. Therefore, it is also preferable if the DC verification is provided to potential bidders earlier rather than later. I come now to the terms of the scope of services which Knight Frank was to provide. The terms of the scope of services were included in the CSA (under Sched 5 to the CSA) and both sides relied on the terms.

As I have mentioned, the plaintiffs were wrong on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 It seemed that the CSC and Knight Frank were in some haste to launch the sale because of concerns about competing land sites and the likelihood that DC rates would be raised from 1 March 2018.

</div> I found that there was some merit in the defendants’ argument that the CSC could have waited two weeks to obtain the DC verification before having the Property launched for sale, since that was Knight Frank’s expectation with regard to when the DC verification would be obtained (although I noted that the DC verification was eventually obtained around four weeks later).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 The truth of the matter was that Knight Frank and the CSC, as well as R&amp;T, were all complacent about the DC. Even though Knight Frank had made it clear that Knight Frank’s estimates of the DC were subject to verification, they had all assumed that there would be no material difference between the last estimate of the DC given by Knight Frank before the launch of the Property for sale and the actual DC as verified. This was why the CSC, Knight Frank and R&amp;T were prepared to let the Property be launched for sale without obtaining the DC verification first. That was also why none of them had highlighted to the subsidiary proprietors that the actual DC could be very different from the last estimate provided. Apparently neither Knight Frank nor R&amp;T advised the CSC to ask for guidance from the subsidiary proprietors as to what the CSC should do in the event of a material difference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 Had the CSC, Knight Frank and R&amp;T given adequate thought to the possibility of a material difference, they ought to have realised that it would have been prudent to obtain the DC verification before the Property was launched for sale. Alternatively, they ought to have highlighted to the subsidiary proprietors that the actual DC could be very different and ought to have sought consensus as to what the CSC should do if in fact there was a material difference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 Indeed, it was ironic that the CSC’s situational update dated 18 October 2017 to the subsidiary proprietors had stated, “The worse thing that can happen is a decision made based on wrong information.”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 In my view, as the information concerning the nil DC was received barely over a week, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, nine days, before the close of the tender, the CSC should have extended the closing date of the tender by at least one week. Knight Frank had estimated in its marketing efforts that potential bidders would have known the actual DC around a month before the close of the tender, but this time estimation was off and potential bidders had around 2.5 weeks less to consider the information concerning the actual DC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 Extending the closing date of the tender by at least one week would have given Knight Frank more time to disseminate this material information concerning the nil DC and potential bidders would have had more time to absorb such information and respond if they so wished, although I agreed that Knight Frank did act quickly to disseminate the information. On the day it knew that no DC was payable, Knight Frank emailed some 652 potential bidders to disseminate this information, presumably the same ones to whom Knight Frank had first publicised the Property when it was launched for sale (see [18] above). Additionally, Knight Frank advertised that no DC was payable in the Business Times on 1 March 2018. In this regard, I was of the view that Knight Frank did not have to inform potential bidders of the development charge baseline as given in URA’s letter, because that did not indicate the maximum allowable development potential of the site of the Property (see [308] and [314] below). The development potential was guided by the URA Master Plan 2014, and Knight Frank had already informed potential bidders in its marketing materials when the Property was launched for sale that the URA Master Plan 2014 permitted a GPR of 1.4 (see [18] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Nevertheless, the CSC and Knight Frank had not given adequate thought to the question of extending the closing date of the tender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 The fact that there was eventually no request from potential bidders for such an extension did not justify the CSC and Knight Frank’s earlier decision not to have an extension. I also did not think that a unilateral extension of the closing date of the tender might be construed as a sign of desperation. This might be so only if there was no good reason for an extension, but here there was a very good reason to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 Further, I did not think it was a good reason to say that the CSC did not have to award the tender to any bidder and could decide to launch the Property for sale again if needed. Instead, the idea should have been to give enough time to potential bidders to respond so as to get the appropriate sale price and to avoid, as much as possible, having to relaunch the Property for sale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) Informing and consulting the subsidiary proprietors</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 Furthermore, the CSC should have informed and consulted the subsidiary proprietors about this material development concerning the nil DC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 As the trustee of the power of collective sale, the CSC had duties to act conscientiously in exercising this power and to make full disclosure of relevant information. These were continuing duties. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span>, “whenever there is reasonable doubt as to the proper course to adopt, the [collective sale committee] ought to seek fresh instructions or guidance from the consenting subsidiary proprietors from whom it draws its mandate” (at [166]). This is even if the collective sale agreement did not specifically require the collective sale committee to seek any fresh instructions or guidance where there was a material change in circumstances, as in this case. I noted here that the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of the collective sale committee consulting the subsidiary proprietors who had already signed the collective sale agreement of new material information, and not just merely updating those who had not signed the collective sale agreement. A collective sale committee must not assume that as and when new material information arises in relation to the collective sale, the majority owners would still simply agree with all the subsequent decisions the collective sale committee makes when these decisions affect the sale of the subsidiary proprietors’ individual properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 It was also not sufficient for the CSC to say that they had the power to increase the reserve price under the CSA,

</div>
</div> because this power was only meant to facilitate and expedite the collective sale process. Indeed, if the actual DC was materially higher than the last DC estimate, the CSC had no authority to reduce the reserve price even if it might be prudent to do so. The CSC only had authority to increase the reserve price. It was also not sufficient for the CSC to say that the subsidiary proprietors had authorised the CSC to sell the Property as long as the sale price was above the reserve price and the independent valuation price. That was also not the point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 While a collective sale committee does not have to consult the subsidiary proprietors every time there is new information, the question as to whether the collective sale committee ought to do so depends particularly on the materiality of the information and whether it is something which may not have been within the reasonable contemplation of the subsidiary proprietors. Furthermore, seeking such fresh instructions is more critical when there is “reasonable doubt that [the collective sale committee’s] original mandate no longer reflects the consensus of the consenting subsidiary proprietors” (<span class="font-italic">Horizon Towers (CA)</span> at [168(i)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 Whether or not the reserve price would have been raised and whether or not potential bidders would have taken into account the reserve price, the point was that the subsidiary proprietors had been given, although inadvertently, an inaccurate impression about the DC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the light of the last DC estimate of $63.19m) and this should have been corrected immediately. The new information concerning the nil DC was material to the subsidiary proprietors. They should also have been given a chance to have their say as to what the next step should be. While the CSC and Knight Frank might have been acting under pressure of time and thus failed to update the subsidiary proprietors immediately, this was pressure which was self-created and arose from their decision not to obtain the DC verification before the Property was launched for sale. In this regard, an extension of the closing date of the tender of at least one week would have given the CSC time to call for an urgent meeting of the subsidiary proprietors or, if possible, a waiver of short notice of an EGM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 The information concerning the nil DC was also unlikely to have been within the reasonable contemplation of the subsidiary proprietors. As it was, when the subsidiary proprietors were subsequently informed about the new information at the owners’ meeting on 19 March 2018, queries were raised as to why they were not informed more promptly. No one said that he had anticipated such a material difference between Knight Frank’s last DC estimate and the actual nil DC as verified. Having said that, I accepted that no assenting subsidiary proprietor sought to withdraw from the CSA and apparently some subsidiary proprietors even added their signatures to the CSA on and after 19 March 2018 (see [28] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 I found that, unfortunately, Knight Frank and the CSC did not even consider whether the new information should have been disclosed to the subsidiary proprietors at the material time. This was not a case where they had raised and discussed this question. It did not cross their minds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 In this regard, I reproduce what Lim (the chairman of the CSC) stated in his affidavit:

However, the truth of the matter was that the CSC did not consider updating the subsidiary proprietors at all as their attention was only on what to do <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the tender process. Had the CSC really considered this point of notifying all the subsidiary proprietors, the CSC would have realised that a newspaper advertisement would not have been adequate in doing so. Furthermore, the CSC would then also have ensured that the subsidiary proprietors were informed as soon as possible either before or immediately after the close of the tender. It was telling that when Knight Frank first sent the subsidiary proprietors a letter after the close of the tender on 8 March 2018 to inform them that a sale contract had been entered into, Knight Frank did not disclose the new information on the nil DC (see [27] above). This suggested that the point of disclosure was not on Knight Frank’s mind and neither had the CSC impressed the point upon Knight Frank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 I noted that in answering the queries at the owners’ meeting on 19 March 2018 as to why the subsidiary proprietors were not informed more promptly on the nil DC, Chan had conceded (albeit very briefly): “I would concede we could have done better”.

</div> In my view, this qualification did not assist the CSC and instead suggested that they were resiling from Chan’s admission that the CSC could have done better.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294  I noted that the CSC did not convene any CSC meeting after being informed that no DC was payable to discuss how to proceed in relation to the tender process. The discussions which they had with Knight Frank or internally amongst themselves were mostly through the use of the phone. The defendants suggested that all decisions of the CSC had to be made at CSC meetings and, consequently, minutes of such meetings should have been kept.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 Paragraph 8 of the Third Schedule does seem to suggest that decisions of a collective sale committee are to be made at physical meetings of a collective sale committee. Paragraph 8(1) refers to a quorum for such a meeting and para 8(2) refers to a decision by the majority of members of the collective sale committee present and voting at any meeting of the collective sale committee. Paragraph 8 is silent on the question whether discussions and decisions of a collective sale committee may be made other than at a physical meeting. In times of urgency and in view of technological advances, it seemed incongruous to insist that all important decisions must be made at a physical meeting. I doubted that that is required. However, even if a physical meeting is not always necessary, the CSC members should have kept a written record of any discussions they had had with Knight Frank or amongst themselves whether through the use of the phone or in person especially on important matters.

</div> Such a record could then be made available to the subsidiary proprietors if required. This would also be in accordance with para 9(1) of the Third Schedule which states that a collective sale committee “shall keep minutes of its proceedings”.

The CSC also acted wrongly in failing to extend the closing date of the tender by at least one week. Further, the CSC should have informed and consulted the subsidiary proprietors about the nil DC before the close of tender but failed to do so. They had been too focused on the potential bidders that they lost sight of the subsidiary proprietors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 Still, these breaches of duty did not conclude the issue whether the transaction was in good faith after taking into account only the sale price under s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(A) (see <span class="font-italic">Thomson View Condominium</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> at [33]). Fortunately for the CSC, Colliers’ valuation was just below the reserve price and the higher bid was higher than the valuation and the reserve prices. As mentioned at [104]–[105] above, the test of good faith is concerned with whether the sale price was the appropriate price in the circumstances, and all the facts of the case must be appraised in the round.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Colliers’ valuation</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Parties’ arguments</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 The question then was whether Colliers’ valuation was fundamentally flawed or was at an undervalue as alleged by the defendants.

Instead, it used the information from the development charge baseline applicable to the Property, which it claimed provided the maximum allowable development potential of the site of the Property, obtainable by applying for permission from URA.

The development charge baseline information did not provide information on the permissible GPR. URA’s letter stated as much (see [308] above).

It is one thing to assume that a successful bidder will request for a higher GPR, it is another to assume that it is prepared to commit to a price based on a possibility that it would obtain approval for a higher GPR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 It was different if AAA’s reasoning had been that there should be a tiered pricing or tiered valuation. The first tier should be based on the current GPR of 1.4. The second is then based on the possible increase of the GPR. This would perhaps then mean that the CSC should have obtained a tiered pricing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a committed price based on the current GPR with a premium if a higher GPR was allowed. However, AAA did not present its valuation on a tiered basis. Neither did the defendants argue that the CSC should have obtained a tiered pricing from the purchaser. Their argument was more basic, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Colliers was wrong to use the GPR of 1.4 in its valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">318 In my view, Colliers’ valuation was not flawed. On the contrary, AAA’s valuation was flawed. A valuation should be based on existing facts. A property may be under-utilised at present and, based on existing facts, its potential is known. This is different from valuing a property based only on a possibility of achieving a higher GPR. I agreed with Colliers that such an approach would be speculative. It would be inappropriate for the purpose of a valuation intended to assist the CSC in a collective sale.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 It was also important to note that AAA did not say that Colliers’ valuation was wrong if it was correctly based on a GPR of 1.4.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 AAA’s report dated 20 August 2018 was made <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>, in valuing the Property to be $637m as at 7 March 2018.

Where the defendants had not even raised any objection pertaining to Colliers’ valuation before the Board when they could have done so, I found that AAA’s report was a last-minute manoeuvre by the defendants to attack the plaintiffs’ reliance on Colliers’ report.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision on the issue of good faith of the transaction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">321 In the present case, the test of good faith is concerned with whether the sale price was the appropriate price in the circumstances, and all the facts of the case must be appraised in the round (see [104]–[105] above). In doing so, the entire sale process culminating in the eventual sale of the Property has to be considered (see [103] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 The defendants had sought to show that many aspects of the transaction were not in good faith. There were indeed many missteps by the CSC, Knight Frank and R&amp;T during the collective sale process, so much so that even some of the assenting subsidiary proprietors (or their representatives) expressed some dissatisfaction with them, like at the owners’ meeting on 19 March 2018 after the SPA had already been entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 However, of the numerous sub-issues/factors which the defendants raised to allege bad faith, it was mainly with regard to the sub-issue pertaining to the DC that I found that the CSC breached several of its duties (see [296] above). In addition, the CSC failed to obtain the approvals of subsidiary proprietors at a general meeting of the apportionment of sale proceeds and the terms and conditions of the CSA as the CSC relied on the wrong advice of R&amp;T. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 On the other hand, I found that Colliers had given a fair independent valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 Ultimately, the issue was whether the transaction was in good faith after taking into account only the sale price, pursuant to s 84A(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)(A). As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Shunfu</span><span class="font-italic"> Ville (CA)</span>, the question is usually whether there was “some want of probity on the part of the relevant parties”, like whether members of the CSC were “actuated by any improper motives or any conflict of interest” (at [61(a)]). It is less likely that the collective sale application should be dismissed “absent clear evidence that the transaction is tainted by unfairness towards some subsidiary proprietors” (at [61(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 After considering all the facts holistically, I concluded that although the conduct of the CSC, Knight Frank and R&amp;T was wanting in various respects, there was no bad faith after taking into account the sale price, which was $68m or 12.55% higher than Colliers’ valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 As it turned out, the subsequent cooling measures introduced by the government in or about July 2018 made the sale price seem even more favourable for all subsidiary proprietors, although this had no direct bearing on the question of good faith which was to be determined at the time the sale process was undertaken.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 The plaintiffs had proven that the transaction was in good faith. Accordingly, I granted an order in terms of prayers 1 to 6 and 9 of the plaintiffs’ application with the qualification that the “Minority Owners”, as defined in the application, need not pay the majority owners’ solicitors’ costs in the application and hearing fees until this question was later determined by the court after hearing arguments on it. Likewise, prayers 7 and 8 of the application regarding costs and disbursements would be heard at a later date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 Although the CSC and their professional advisers might view this court’s decision as a victory for the majority owners, I expressed the hope that they reflect long and hard on their missteps. It was also a pity that the plaintiffs had not been more forthcoming in their conduct of the litigation. They were slow to acknowledge the possibility that there might have been missteps in the sale process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 The plaintiffs should also not have waited until the time of the hearing to explain in the course of oral submissions R&amp;T’s various missteps, especially with respect to R&amp;T’s advice as to whether it was necessary to obtain the approvals of the apportionment of sale proceeds and of the terms and conditions of the CSA at an EGM, and R&amp;T’s omission to respond promptly to questions from the defendants’ lawyers about the ownership of units by associates of Lim and Chan. The explanation should have been stated earlier in an affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">331 I mentioned that I would take the missteps and the way in which the litigation was conducted by both sides into account on the question of costs and disbursements to be decided later.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li  <br/>Judge</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Soon Peng Adrian, Ang Leong Hao, Gan Hiang Chye and Norman Ho (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Tan Gim Hai Adrian, Ong Pei Ching and Goh Qian’en, Benjamin (TSMP Law Corporation) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Annex</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Chronology of Key Events</span></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/No</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Event</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">27 May 2017</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Knight Frank presented to the subsidiary proprietors an estimated sale price for the Property of at least <span class="font-weight-bold">$455.8m</span> and a DC estimate of <span class="font-weight-bold">$48.4m</span>.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">2</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1 July 2017</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">An EGM was convened and the CSC was constituted.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">3</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Early July 2017</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Knight Frank was appointed as the marketing agent, and R&amp;T was appointed as the legal firm for the collective sale.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center">4</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">9 September 2017</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">An EGM was convened and Knight Frank shared a proposed reserve price of <span class="font-weight-bold">$500m</span> and a DC estimate of around <span class="font-weight-bold">$58.5m</span>.</div><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">The subsidiary proprietors did not vote on or otherwise approve the apportionment of sale proceeds and the terms and conditions of the CSA.
