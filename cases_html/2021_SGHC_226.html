Under the Customs Act in force at the time of the offences, s 128I continued to be subject to the same penalty regime as ss 128F and 128H. This suggested that the legislative intention was for ss 128I, 128F and 128H of the Customs Act to be treated with equivalency.

Much like how it was entirely fortuitous that an offender is caught importing instead of unloading the duty unpaid goods, it was equally fortuitous that an offender was caught dealing with the duty unpaid goods instead of unloading the duty unpaid goods. The different physical acts involved in the chain of smuggling should not be the basis on which the culpability of the offender is differentiated.

The DJ was therefore right to impose a higher sentence on the appellant. According to the respondent, an offender who ran a one-man operation was far more culpable than a low-level paid worker involved in the smuggling of duty unpaid cigarettes on behalf of a syndicate due to his higher level of ownership and control over the operation.

</div> Namely, the respondent highlighted that the appellant charged his friends a mark-up of almost 30% on each carton of cigarettes. Further, given he had been purchasing cigarettes from the Seller for a year before his arrest (since October 2019), and the fact that the Appellant earned at least $11 on each carton of duty unpaid cigarettes he sold to his friends, it was likely that the appellant understated his profits.

Hypothetically, if a paid worker within a criminal smuggling enterprise was involved in every step of the chain, it is perhaps fortuitous that he or she was caught at one step, and not another. It was arbitrary to say that he was more culpable if apprehended at step X, but less culpable if apprehended at step Y. Equally, in my view, it was arbitrary to say that person A, charged with performing step X, was more culpable than person B who was charged with performing step Y. I saw no principled basis to distinguish the culpabilities of two offenders <span class="font-italic">purely</span> by looking at which step in the chain they were charged with performing. Instead, the culpability of offenders may be distinguished by examining other factors, such as further involvement in owning, managing and/or controlling the smuggling enterprise (<span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span> at [25]). In this regard, the factors identified by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> at [35] may also be relevant: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the case concerns a repeat offence that has not been factored in the charge;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the accused was acting on his own or as part of a syndicate; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) what role the accused played to the extent the criminality inherent in the conduct is not captured in the charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For all these reasons, I held that the sentencing benchmarks in <span class="font-italic">Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Shuo</span>, albeit set out in relation to s 128H and adapted from Menon CJ’s benchmarks for s 128F in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Lai</span>, were relevant and applicable under s 128I(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Customs Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentence in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Under the <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span> framework, the key parameter informing the sentence as a starting point is the quantity of tobacco products involved in the offence (<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>at [35]). Because the appellant entered a plea of guilt, I agreed with the DJ and the respondent that Scenario 1 (as described in <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span>) better represented the appellant’s situation. Under Scenario 1, if the offence involved 2.180kg of duty unpaid cigarettes, the starting position for the appropriate sentence for the Excise Duty Charge was two months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The appellant argued that he was less culpable than Chan

The answer to this question addressed (a) whether, notwithstanding the reasons at [31]–[40] above, the starting position for the sentences for both charges in this case should be calibrated downwards to a fine, and (b) if not, whether a stiffer sentence was warranted for the appellant as compared to Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 By way of an aside, although the appellant did not fall neatly within Scenario 1 in <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span>, I agreed with the respondent

</div> that this did not render the <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span> framework inapplicable. The framework simply reflected the cases that made up the bulk of everyday sentencing practice. However, there was still room for upward and downward adjustments from the initial benchmarks to account for each particular case’s facts and circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span> at [31]). The DJ’s uplift of the appellant’s sentence to account for his greater culpability over an archetypal offender like Chan, whose s 128I(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) offence concerned the same quantity of duty unpaid cigarettes, is a prime example of an adjustment from the initial benchmark.

He was responsible for informing them of the variants of cigarettes available and collecting payment from these friends. He also received the cigarettes from the Seller and informed his friends to collect the cigarettes from his residence. I therefore rejected the appellant’s contention that he was merely an “end-consumer”.

All other things being equal, it is my view that “X” should be regarded as less culpable than “A” because “X” is not involved in a syndicate, but “X” should be regarded as <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">much</span> more culpable than “B” despite the fact that “B” may be involved in the syndicate, because the culpability of “X” is much elevated due to the fact of “X”’s ownership and control over a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">large-scale</span> smuggling operation, though not in a syndicate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Plainly, the appellant’s distribution system fell short of being a “fairly large smuggling operation”.

</div> The DJ did not speculate further as to whether the appellant earned more than merely “tens of dollars”. In addition, the DJ rightfully pointed out that the appellant profited from consolidating orders from his friends in another respect – he enjoyed cost savings by ordering cigarettes in bulk from the Seller.

</div> Without a bulk order of minimally ten cartons, the appellant would have had to pay $39 to $50 per carton of duty unpaid cigarettes. By placing a bulk order for himself and his friends, he instead enjoyed a rate of $39 per carton from the Seller. As such, even if the tens of dollars he earned from his friends was money given to him out of “goodwill”, he still benefited from these cost savings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As was stated by See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Keet v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1316 at [47], “[i]t is settled law that the commission of an offence for personal gain is generally an aggravating sentencing consideration.” I doubted that the appellant set up the distribution system (where he consolidated orders from his friends) <span class="font-italic">purely</span> as a “personal favour for his friends”.

</div> As the respondent pointed out, if the appellant had acted purely out of charity, there would have been no need to charge his friends a marked up price for each carton of cigarettes.

</div> Therefore, that he was motivated by the monetary benefits described above, or <span class="font-italic">at least</span> to secure cost savings for himself by consolidating bulk orders with his friends, elevates his culpability.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In these premises, I upheld the DJ’s finding that the appellant’s culpability was greater than Chan’s. The appellant was not merely an end-consumer. Rather, he dealt with the duty unpaid cigarettes, in part, as a distributor. The need to generally deter the illicit distribution of duty unpaid cigarettes, which if left unchecked would amplify the evils described at [32], called for a custodial sentence. Thus, having regard to the benchmarks in <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span>, and the weight of cigarettes involved in the charges, I agreed that two months’ imprisonment was an appropriate starting point for the Excise Duty Charge. The appellant’s submission that the starting point for his sentence was a fine because of his “low culpability” had no leg to stand on. Further, because the appellant was more culpable than Chan, a week’s uplift to the sentence for the Excise Duty Charge, from the two months’ imprisonment which Chan received for his s 128I(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) charge involving 2.180kg of smuggled cigarettes, was fair and proportionate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In summary, the DJ did not err in law or fact when sentencing the appellant. There were no grounds to find that the individual sentences for the Excise Duty Charge and GST Charge or global sentence of nine weeks’ imprisonment were manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 For completeness, as intimated at [16] above, the sentencing benchmarks in <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo</span> and <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span> are not identical. However, whether one set of benchmarks should prevail over the other was not submitted on, nor was it, in my view, a relevant issue in this appeal. This was because the starting position in <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Lai</span> is three months’ imprisonment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a month higher than the starting position in <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo </span>for Scenario 1). If the appellant’s sentence was not manifestly excessive under the <span class="font-italic">Pang Shuo </span>framework, all the more the threshold for appellate intervention was not met under the <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I therefore dismissed the appellant’s appeal against his sentence.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Chuhui Maxine and Yong Zhee Hoe (Rajwin &amp; Yong LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Adrian Loo and Chng Luey Chi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
