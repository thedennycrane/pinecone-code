Over the next few years, the defendant became increasingly dissatisfied with the way in which the claimant had been administering the estate, and alleged that the claimant had refused to provide a proper account of the estate’s assets, reneged on a promised interim distribution of S$1 million, and treated the defendant inequitably as compared to her fellow siblings and beneficiaries.

HC/OS 928/2020 would be discontinued, and the first settlement agreement would have no further force or effect.

</div> Additionally, the claimant filed the present application on 31 May 2022, seeking an injunction against the defendant from proceeding with HCF/OSP 6/2022 on the basis of the negative covenant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The claimant’s case was that Clauses 11 and 18 of the second settlement agreement constituted a negative covenant whose effect was to absolutely restrict either party from bringing any proceedings against the other, save for breach of the second settlement agreement<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> until the final disposition of HC/S </span>821/2015. This being the case, as the defendant had breached the negative covenant by bringing HCF/OSP 6/2022, an interim injunction should be granted <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">as</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> a matter of course </span>(<span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 997 (“<span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span>”) at [32]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The defendant’s case was that the operation of the negative covenant was conditional on the claimant fully complying with the terms of the second settlement agreement. As the claimant had not done so, Clause 11 was not effective to restrain the defendant from bringing any kind of proceedings and could not be the basis for an interim injunction to that effect. In any event, as the claimant had withheld the S$15,000 monthly payment on the basis that the defendant had allegedly repudiated the second settlement agreement, the claimant was no longer entitled to rely on it. Accordingly, the appropriate test for the grant of an interim injunction was the balance of convenience test in <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid Company v Ethicon Limited</span> [1975] AC 396, which in the present case weighed against the grant of the injunction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The issues which arose for my determination were therefore as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the operation of the negative covenant contained in Clauses 11 and 18 conditional on the claimant’s fulfilment of the terms of the second settlement agreement? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the answer to the above question is “yes”, had the claimant breached the terms of the second settlement agreement? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any case, in refusing to make payment to the defendant, had the claimant forgone her right to rely on the second settlement agreement? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Based on the answers to </span>the previous questions, what were the appropriate principles which governed the present application for an interim injunction? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: whether the negative covenant was conditional</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The first issue was whether the operation of the negative covenant was conditional upon the claimant’s fulfilment of the terms of the settlement agreement, which was ultimately a question of contractual interpretation.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 11</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Provided that the terms of this Agreement are fully complied with</span> by the [claimant], the [defendant] also agrees not to commence any further litigation against the Estate or any of the other beneficiaries of the Estate, in relation to the Non-India Assets and/or matters connected with HC/Suit 821/2015 and/or by using any information, correspondence and/or documents arising in relation to and pursuant to this Agreement, until after the trial in HC/Suit 821/2015 has been concluded and any appeal(s) thereafter has been finally determined and/or when HC/Suit 821/2015 is withdrawn and/or settled. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The defendant’s position was that the phrase “Provided that the terms of this Agreement are fully complied with” rendered the operation of Clause 11 conditional upon the claimant’s compliance with all the terms of the second settlement agreement. However, while this may have been a sensible interpretation of Clause 11 if it was read in isolation, the “whole contract” approach to contractual interpretation directs the court to adopt a holistic approach that is based on the whole contract, and not to fixate upon a particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131]). Clause 11 therefore had to be read together with Clause 18, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 18</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Parties shall only be entitled to sue on this Agreement and shall not be entitled to revive or pursue OS 928.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Thus read together, the effect of Clauses 11 and 18 was that parties were prohibited from bringing any claim against each other in relation to the non-India assets, except for a breach of the second settlement agreement. The restriction in Clause 18 was expressed as applying to “parties”, which could only have meant both the claimant and the defendant. It therefore applied to situations in which the <span class="font-italic">claimant</span> might have been in breach of the second settlement agreement, and stipulated that in such cases, the defendant would only have been entitled to sue on the second settlement agreement. This would have made little sense if a breach by the claimant would have meant that the defendant was free to bring fresh proceedings to enforce the same claims and underlying causes of action with which the second settlement agreement had been concerned – in this case the defendant’s rights <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiary to an account of the estate, as would have been the logical consequence of the defendant’s conditional interpretation of Clause 11. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On the contrary, the effect of a settlement agreement is to put an end to prior proceedings, preclude the taking of further steps not provided for in the settlement agreement, and supersede the original cause of action altogether (<span class="font-italic">Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 131 at [95]), and this applies equally to both the first and second settlement agreements. In other words, the defendant’s right to an account under the law would have been superseded by her contractual rights under the first settlement agreement, which would have in turn been superseded by her rights under the second settlement agreement. It therefore mattered not that the category of claims articulated in Clause 11 was wider than simply for breaches of the second settlement agreement, nor that the second settlement agreement did not expressly purport to curtail the defendant’s “general rights at law”, as the defendant had observed.

</div> However, the force of this argument, and the observation that Clause 18 neither cross-referenced, addressed, nor appeared in the same section as Clause 11, was somewhat undermined by the fact that the section in which Clause 18 resides was titled “General”. Indeed, several of the other clauses appearing in that section had also necessarily to be read as applying to the second settlement agreement as a whole, and all the other provisions therein. For example, Clause 20 provided that time shall be of the essence in the performance of the second settlement agreement. This could not sensibly have been read as imposing any standalone obligation, but rather as applying to and governing the performance of the obligations contained in all the other clauses. The same may also have been said of Clause 19, which prohibited the variation of the second settlement agreement save by in writing and by agreement and signature of all parties, and Clause 21, which directed parties to act in good faith and so as to give full effect to the intent, spirit, and provisions of the second settlement agreement. Indeed, the location of Clause 18 supported the <span class="font-italic">claimant’s</span> interpretation, that it applied to all other clauses such that the <span class="font-italic">only</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>permissible remedy for <span class="font-italic">any</span> breach of the second settlement agreement would have been to sue for breach thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Accordingly, the proper interpretation of Clauses 11 and 18 was that they imposed an absolute prohibition on either party from bringing proceedings against the other until HC/S 821/2015 is resolved, except for breaches of the second settlement agreement. In view of this conclusion, there was no need to consider whether the claimant had in fact failed to comply with her obligation to render accounts of the estate under the second settlement agreement.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: whether the claimant had forgone her right to rely on the second settlement agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendant further argued that the claimant was no longer entitled to rely on the second settlement agreement. This was because the claimant had ceased making the monthly payments of S$15,000, claiming that she was no longer bound to do so owing to the defendant’s “repudiatory breach” in commencing HCF/OSP 6/2022.

</div> Additionally, the claimant had in HC/OS 49/2022 also included a claim against the defendant for all sums <span class="font-italic">already </span>paid to and received by the latter under the second settlement agreement, on the basis of the same “repudiatory breach”. In doing so, the claimant had effectively taken the position that the second settlement agreement was no longer binding on her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This court found that neither the claimant’s cessation of monthly payments nor her claim for sums paid prevented her from relying on the second settlement agreement. Insofar as the cessation of monthly payments was concerned, this was as much a breach of the second settlement agreement as was the defendant’s bringing of HCF/OSP 6/2022. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Pursuant to the above analysis at [16]–[22], the only available remedy to the innocent party is to sue on the second settlement agreement. This was in fact precisely what the defendant had done in respect of the claimant’s failure to make the monthly payments,

</div> although curiously not for the claimant’s alleged failure to provide the accounts. It did not relieve her of her own obligations under the second settlement agreement, nor preclude the claimant from seeking enforcement thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The claimant’s attempt to reclaim sums already paid to the defendant was not also inconsistent with the present application for an injunction. By parity of reasoning, insofar as a plea for specific performance does not necessarily constitute an affirmation of a contract or waiver of prior repudiatory breaches (<span class="font-italic">CSDS </span><span class="font-italic">Aircraft Sales &amp; Leasing Inc v Singapore Airlines Ltd </span>[2022] 1 SLR 284 at [48]), the institution of an action for damages should likewise not constitute acceptance of repudiation. It is also not inconsistent to seek damages for past breaches, while also seeking to hold the breaching party to their obligations going forward. The claimant thus remained entitled to seek performance of the second settlement agreement, as did the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: what were the appropriate principles governing the grant of an injunction? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having found that the restriction in Clauses 11 and 18 was not conditional and that the claimant remained entitled to rely upon the second settlement agreement, the relevant principles were therefore those articulated in <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span> at [32], that where a breach of a negative covenant has occurred or is imminent, an injunction to restrain a prospective or further breach would normally be granted as a matter of course. The balance of convenience test would not apply in such cases, and the injunction would only be refused if granting it would cause the defendant particular hardship(s) over and above simply having to observe the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In this case, in view of the defendant’s commencement of HCF/OSP 6/2022, there was no real question as to whether she had breached the negative covenant. It was also difficult to see what particular hardship(s) would have been caused by granting the injunction sought by the claimant, given that the defendant remained entitled to seek an account of the estate’s assets from the claimant by suing for specific performance of the second settlement agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This court therefore granted the injunction restraining the defendant from bringing any proceedings other than for breach of the second settlement agreement, until such time as HC/S 821/2015 is disposed of.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Niru Pillai, Liew Teck Huat and Phang Cun Kuang (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Gerui, Estad Amber Joy and Melinna Teo (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
