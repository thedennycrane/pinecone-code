The Applicants did not oppose the second part of the prayer. The arbitral proceedings were subject to confidentiality, and on the materials before me no reason appears why the derivative interest in protecting their confidentiality (see <span class="font-italic">The Republic of India v Deutsche Telecom AG </span>[2023] SGCA(I) 4 at [23]) should not be recognised as an exception to the general principle of open justice. However, I am doubtful about an order effectively directed to myself, and an order is unnecessary. Avoiding the confusion of consonants in the names in the allocated title, I will refer to the First Applicant, a company, as “ACo” and to the Second Applicant, a natural person, as “A” (and to them together as the “Applicants”), and to the Respondent, a company, as “RCo”; and I will frame this judgment and any orders so as not to reveal the parties’ identities (including gender neutrality as to A). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The relief claimed in the application was in the form that the Applicants applied to set aside the awards in both arbitrations; that is, that ACo applied to set aside the award against A (the “A award”) as well as the award against itself (the “ACo award”), and vice versa.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There is superficial attraction in the proposition that when the arbitral tribunal corrects an error in an award, the award as corrected becomes the award and so receipt of the award means receipt of the corrected award. The award as corrected is thenceforward the award. But that does not mean that “the award” in Art 34(3) is the award as corrected, or that the date of receipt of the award in Art 34(3) is the date of receipt of the corrected award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 This result is not mandated by any definition of an award: the Model Law does not have a definition, and the definition in s 2(1) of the IAA refers simply to “a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the dispute”. Nor, contrary to the Applicants’ submissions, is it mandated by the Tribunal’s references in the corrections to the corrections forming part of the awards. They do, but the statements to that effect to which the Tribunal referred, found also in the closing words of Art 33(1) in relation to an interpretation of an award, serve a different purpose and do not make the award as corrected the award for all purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 An arbitral tribunal’s authority generally expires on the issue of a final award, when it becomes <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>: see <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and another appeal </span>[2016] 1 SLR 966 at [44]–[49]. In David Caron and Lee Caplan, <span class="font-italic">The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2013), it is said in the commentary to Art 38 that the purpose is to “extend the arbitral tribunal’s authority beyond the date of the award”, and that “the ultimate status of a correction to an award will depend on the terms of the applicable national arbitration law”. This reflects the <span class="font-italic">Report of Working Group II (Arbitration and Conciliation) on the work of its fifty-first session</span><span class="font-italic"> (Vienna, 14</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">–</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">18 September 2009)</span> (UNCITRAL, 2009) at para 111, in its consideration of Art 36, which became Art 38, where it was said in response to the suggestion that stating that a correction would form part of the award would create difficulties “in particular with deadlines for recourse, depending on what the date of the corrected award was determined to be”, that the national arbitration law would govern the matter. In Chong et al, <span class="font-italic">A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2013) at paras 14.55<span style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">–</span>14.56, the commentary on r 33 also treats the statement as providing an exception to the principle that the arbitral tribunal is <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>after entering an award. That is, the statements that a correction forms part of the award give or confirm the arbitral tribunal’s authority, and do not further prescribe the effect of the correction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The effect of the correction must be determined from the Model Law as part of Singapore law, as repeated in O 48 r 2(3). The statement that a correction pursuant to either Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or Art 33(2) forms part of the award is not found in Art 33 of the Model Law, which conspicuously says that only as to an interpretation of the award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 What is meant by “the award” in Art 34(3), and the answer to the question, is a matter of construction of the Article, together with Art 33, in its place in the Model Law. It was submitted on behalf of RCo that Art 34(3) provides for postponement of the commencement of the three-month period only in the case of a request for correction, so that without more, there was no postponement in the case of a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative.

Given the importance of speed and finality in the context of arbitration, it would have been most surprising if the statutory intention, embodied in those sections, was that any correction – no matter how trivial or irrelevant – had the effect of postponing the strict time limit set out in s 70(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Other than for its highlighting the importance of speed and finality in arbitration, <span class="font-italic">Daewoo </span>is of little assistance to RCo.

</div> a similar observation was made that where there is a material application for a correction and a correction is indeed then made, time runs from the date of the award as corrected. But in the similar context of a request to correct an award, in that case as referred to in Art 33, in <span class="font-italic">BRQ and another v BRS and another and another matter</span> [2019] SGHC 260, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J rejected the need for materiality, pointing out in particular at [53] that the English legislative provision was not only not based on the Model Law, but also adopted “a diametrically different scheme for time limits for challenging an award from that adopted in the Model Law”. On appeal, in <span class="font-italic">BRS v BR</span><span class="font-italic">Q </span>at [69]–[72], it was held that it was necessary that the substance of a request under Art 33 must come within the scope of Art 33 for it to have the effect of extending the initial time limit under Art 34(3), so that a mere request did not automatically bring postponement but the request could be examined for its substance to determine if time should be extended; however, the Court of Appeal arrived at this finding without reference to <span class="font-italic">Daewoo.</span> <span class="font-italic">Daewoo </span>is a very different case, and gives no support for treating the date of a correction pursuant to Art 33(2) as the date of the award, or the award as corrected as the award, for the purposes of Art 34(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It is not as simple as Art 34(3) providing for postponement only in the case of a request for correction, and Ms Chong submitted also to the effect that a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative would be minor (referring in particular to the court in <span class="font-italic">BRS v BR</span><span class="font-italic">Q </span>likening a request under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to what is often referred to in court proceedings as the slip rule (at [70])), and had to be within thirty days, so that there was no need for postponement of the commencement of the three-month period.

</div>
</div> However, the matter can be taken further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53  Article 34(3) postpones the commencement of the three-month period not by providing that the receipt of the award becomes the receipt of the corrected award, or of a response declining correction. That is, the date on which the party making the application “had received the award”, prior to the making of any request (which necessarily means receipt of the original award), remains the date on which the original award was received. But in the case of a request for correction, a differently ascertained date, namely the date on which the request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal, is substituted as the commencement of the three-month period. Postponement in that way is no doubt adopted because there are three different kinds of request, and it is also necessary to accommodate when a request for correction, interpretation or an additional award is declined by the arbitral tribunal, so that there is no award as corrected, interpreted or supplemented. But it means that the determinant of the date of the receipt of the award is unchanged from the receipt of the original award itself: in Art 34(3), it remains the original award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The same determinant is also used in Arts 33(1) and (3) in stipulating the period of thirty days from receipt of the award within which a request for correction, interpretation or an additional award must be made. In those sub-articles, “the award” cannot mean the award as corrected, interpreted or supplemented, otherwise there would be a reopening of the period of thirty days if the arbitral tribunal acceded to the request and corrected, interpreted or supplemented the award. Similarly, in Art 33(2), “the award” in the stipulation of thirty days from the date of the award must mean the original award: the thirty days do not start to run again upon the arbitral tribunal making a correction on its own initiative simply because the award as corrected becomes the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In Art 34(3), then, as in its appearances in Art 33, “the award” in the phrase “the date on which the party making that application had received the award” means the original award, which is in the present case the awards dated 18 February 2023. If postponement of the date of receipt of that award is to come from a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s initiative, it must be found elsewhere in the same manner that postponement in the case of a request for correction is found in the latter part of the sub-article. It is, however, not to be found. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The scheme makes good sense, in line with the attributes of speed and finality. The correction of an error in computation or a clerical or typographical error, or an error of similar nature, which the arbitral tribunal considers it can make on its own initiative, is unlikely to be contentious – and that is so even if the error in computation has an effect on the bottom line of the award, because it can readily be corrected once recognised.

</div>
</div> <span class="font-italic">Harold Birnbaum and Islamic Republic of Iran, </span>DEC 124-967-2 (14 December 1995), such a correction was described as “a restoration of the award’s proper contents” (at [10]). That can be seen as the reason the Model Law does not include the statement that a correction, whether pursuant to the request of a party or on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative and as distinct from an interpretation, shall form part of the award: it is regarded as already part of the award, and by the correction is simply recognised and made apparent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 A party dissatisfied with an award has three months to examine it for a ground or grounds to challenge it, and its examination and decision on whether to challenge the award is unlikely to be impeded or altered by a correction made by the arbitral tribunal on its own initiative. And in any event, the correction must be made within the thirty days: the party still has two months to come to its decision. The time can therefore continue to run from the receipt of the original award, in the interests of speed and finality, without injustice to a potential challenger. In comparison, if a request is made under Art 33 it is more likely to be substantive and contentious in the case of interpretation or an additional award, or contentious even in the case of a computation, clerical, typographical or similar error where a request to the arbitral tribunal is considered necessary. The decision on the request may not be known until close to the expiry of the three-month period or until it has expired, as the tribunal may extend if necessary the period of time within which it shall made a correction, interpretation or an additional award under Art 33(4), and this may affect the party’s decision on whether to challenge the award. Therefore, there is a provision for the postponement of the commencement of the three-month period. In gist, needless passage of time in the case of a correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative is avoided, but an appropriate passage of time is allowed in the case of a request for correction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Contrary to the Applicants’ submissions, this does not mean an absurd defeating of the arbitral tribunal’s power to correct an award. Any correction on the arbitral tribunal’s own initiative must be within 30 days of the award, well within the three-month period, and the correction is still effective: the award which is enforced, and also the award which is challenged, is the award as corrected. Nor is there incongruity by contrast with postponement of the three-month period in the case of a request for correction, but rather there is a sensible scheme as outlined in the preceding paragraph.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The answer to the question</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Applicants “had received the award” on 6 March 2023. The three-month time period commenced with the Applicants’ receipt of the awards dated 18 February 2023 on 6 March 2023, the corrections did not affect that commencement, and the application was thus brought out of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This is sufficient for dismissal of the application.

</div> This fell short of direct evidence that A was given a copy of the Terms, and there was no other direct evidence from RCo’s side of the provision of or dealing with the Terms, or in any way with the signing of the Letter or the Account Opening Form. It is not necessary to make a finding, but in the light of the clear acknowledgments in the Letter and the Account Opening Form and the unsatisfactory evidence from A, and despite the want of evidence from RCo’s side, I have reservations about a lack of at least basic facility in English and considerable reservations about the asserted lack of knowledge of the existence of the Terms as terms and conditions to which the Facility was subject. A had had a business career leading to considerable wealth, and it is unlikely that such a significant transaction as obtaining the Facility would have been undertaken with disregard of what they were committing ACo to, and it was not said that they did not know what was in the Letter or understand what they were doing in signing the Letter, only that they did not understand its “implications”.

Arbitration clauses are commonplace in agreements such as the contract under which the Facility was provided, and in the express subjection of the opening and operation of the Account to the Terms, there is no reason to parse the arbitration clause out and find that it was not incorporated. Nor was it necessary to draw particular attention to the arbitration clause: it is sufficient to refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd v Hualon Corp (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd</span> <span class="font-italic">(receiver and manager appointed)</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1207 at [77]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a response to this approach, the respondent submits that it is necessary for the appellant to go one step further, and show, positively, that Mr Oung Da Ming had actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, for instance, by pointing to a statement made by Mr Oung Da Ming to that effect. We do not accept this submission because to do so would severely undermine the efficacy of arbitration agreements. If the respondent is right, then each time a party enters into a contract containing an arbitration agreement, it would have to enquire into whether the agent or officer who signed the agreement on behalf of the counterparty had actual knowledge of the arbitration clause, and obtain a statement from that person to that effect, or risk stymying future arbitration proceedings because of an assertion by the counterparty that despite being done by the underlying contract, it did not have knowledge of the arbitration clause specifically. This would place too onerous a burden on contracting parties seeking to arbitrate their disputes, and would run counter to our courts’ approach towards arbitration (see Sundaresh Menon ed, <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2014) at para 2.002). It would also be completely contradictory to the well-established doctrine that a party who signs a document is deemed to know the contents of the same. In our view, a party who is bound by the underlying contract must also be taken to have actual knowledge of the contents of the same, including any arbitration clause contained therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75  It does not matter that A says now that they would not have agreed to the arbitration clause in the Terms, or indeed to cl 1.3 in the Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In so far as it was independently said that the arbitration clause was not incorporated because it failed the tests for a unilateral arbitration clause, there is also no substance in the submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Pittalis</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the question was whether a rent review clause which contemplated that only one of the parties could refer the matter to arbitration was an arbitration clause. Fox LJ held that it was an arbitration clause, saying (at 875):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a fully bilateral agreement which constitutes a contract to refer. The fact that the option is exerciseable by one of the parties only seems to me to be irrelevant. The arrangement suits both parties. The reason why that is so in case such as the present and in the <span class="font-italic">Tote Bookmakers case</span> [1985] Ch 261 is because the landlord is protected, if there is no arbitration, by his own assessment of the rent, as stated in his notice; and the tenant is protected, if he is dissatisfied with the landlord’s assessment of the rent, by his right to refer the matter to arbitration.<span class="font-italic"> Both sides, therefore, have accepted the arrangement, and there is no question of any lack of mutuality.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Applicants’ submissions took from the emphasised sentence above that for a unilateral arbitration clause, it was necessary that both sides had agreed to the clause being a unilateral arbitration clause, so that there was mutuality in that respect; and, as I understand the argument, it was that ACo had not agreed because, even if the Terms in general were incorporated into the Letter, attention had not been specifically drawn to the arbitration clause. However, his Lordship was not saying that there is an <span class="font-italic">additional</span> need for agreement in the case of a unilateral arbitration clause, but was noting that the arrangement to which the parties had agreed, which happened to be a clause under which only one party could refer the matter to arbitration, suited both parties. The only question here is whether the Terms were incorporated in the Letter; if they were, the arbitration clause was incorporated together with the other terms and conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In <span class="font-italic">Dyna-Jet</span>, the question was whether there should be a stay of court proceedings said to have been brought in breach of an arbitration agreement. Under the arbitration clause, a dispute could be referred to arbitration “at the election of” Dyna-Jet, which was described as asymmetrical. The Court of Appeal said (at [13]), referring to the requirement that there be a valid arbitration agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In respect of the first of the three requirements outlined at [11] above, we agree with the Judge and also the Appellant that the Clause constituted a valid arbitration agreement between the Appellant and the Respondent. It was immaterial for this purpose that the Clause: (a) entitled only the Respondent (but not the Appellant) to compel its counterparty to arbitrate a dispute (the “lack of mutuality” characteristic); and (b) made arbitration of a future dispute entirely optional, instead of placing parties under an immediate obligation to arbitrate their disputes (the “optionality” characteristic). On the weight of modern, Commonwealth authority, which the Judge considered, neither of these features prevented the court from finding that there was a valid arbitration agreement between the present parties. And before us, neither party contended otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Court went on to hold that the dispute was not within the arbitration clause because Dyna-Jet had elected to litigate by commencing the court proceedings. It did not state a particular requirement for the validity of a unilateral or an asymmetrical arbitration clause; on the contrary, it recognised the accepted validity of such a clause. Again, the only question is whether the Terms were incorporated into the Letter. If they were, the arbitration clause was incorporated together with the other terms and conditions in the Terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The other reasons</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I go to the Applicants’ reasons in addition to failure in incorporation of the Terms. Two submissions were made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The first was that the arbitration clause was void because the contract under which the Facility was provided was an illegal contract; the contract was unenforceable, and so was the arbitration clause if part of the contract. The illegality was the same illegality as was asserted under Ground (c) for the awards being contrary to the public policy of Singapore.

</div> It is sufficient to state here that for the reasons given when dealing with that ground, the contract was not illegal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The second was that the Letter was “unreasonable” in that cl 1.3 gave RCo the ability to revise the Terms, including the arbitration clause, placing ACo in great uncertainty; it was said that “well-informed consent” had not been given to “such an unreasonable arbitration clause”, apparently treating the arbitration clause as something which could be revised.

</div> As with notice to ACo, I am not satisfied that A has furnished proof that they were not given proper notice of the arbitral proceedings, and on the contrary, am satisfied they were given actual notice whereby they were well aware of the arbitral proceedings and had full opportunity to present their case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 A sufficient basis for these findings is that the BVI address was ACo’s registered address and the 163 email address was a functioning email address, used by A on behalf of ACo. In any event, the various addresses are given in the Client Information Statement (see [13]). The purpose of the Client Information Statement was to tell RCo the means of communication with ACo, and with A as a person giving instructions in relation to the Facility and the Account, to which the Guarantee must be added as a part of the provision of the Facility. The observations in <span class="font-italic">Re Shanghai Xinan Screenwall Building &amp; Decoration Co Ltd </span>[2022] 5 SLR 393 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Shanghai</span>”<span class="font-italic">) </span>at [32], holding that that delivery of a notice of arbitration to the address stated in the contract between the parties was proper notice of the arbitration, are applicable:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thirdly, the address to which the various documents were delivered was the address indicated in the Contract. Where an address is given in a contract, it is a simple inference that the address has been included to facilitate communication between the parties. Thus, in the absence of any manifestation of a contrary intention, service of a notice of arbitration in respect of that contract at that address will usually amount to proper notice of the arbitration unless prior to the date of service the respondent has notified the claimant of a change of address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, there is also not just an inference from giving addresses in the Client Information Statement. By cl 7 of the Letter, a communication to ACo in connection with the Account “shall be … made”, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, by post or otherwise in writing to the address set out in the application for the Account “or such other address … as you may from time to time notify us in writing”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Article 3(1) of the Model Law provides, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that unless otherwise agreed, a written communication is deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered at his place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address. The UNCITRAL Rules, which by the arbitration clause in the Terms were the rules for the ACo arbitration, provide, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that notice provided by any means to an address designated by the party for the purpose of receiving notifications, or delivered to the addressee’s place of business, habitual, residence, or mailing address is deemed to have been received. The SIAC Rules, which by the arbitration clause in the Guarantee were the rules for the A arbitration, provide, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that any notice shall be deemed to have been received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or to the addressee’s habitual residence, place of business or designated address, or any address agreed by the parties, and specifically permits electronic communication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">Re Shanghai</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it was said (at [33]) that deemed service may be rebutted by appropriate evidence of non-receipt, but in the absence of such evidence, service in a manner satisfying Art 3(1) of the Model Law was held to be proper notice of the arbitral proceedings. In the present case, there is the evidence of A referred to above. I do not regard it as acceptable evidence of non-receipt. The direct assertion that ACo and A did not receive any notice of the arbitral proceedings is qualified, but even if the qualification is put aside, it is plainly incorrect in the light of the mass of evidence from which there must have been actual knowledge of the arbitral proceedings. Without going into detail, by force of these provisions also ACo and A received proper notice of the arbitral proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It remains to refer to A’s assertion that even if they had received email notices, they could not understand them because they did not read or understand English. I have expressed reservations about the lack of at least a basic facility in English (see [68]), and the contention that inability to read or understand English would make service of notice of the arbitral proceedings ineffective does not sit well with effective provision and use of the Facility by signature of the Letter in English. Nonetheless, Mr Ang submitted that if the Notice of Arbitration was served on A via their email address, they would not have been validly notified given that they cannot read or write English.

</div> A similar submission was not made as to notice to ACo, but I take that to have been intended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The short answer to the submission is that both arbitration clauses provided that the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. For the reasons given above, ACo was bound by the arbitration clause in the Terms, and A did not dispute the validity of the arbitration agreement in the Guarantee. For the longer answer, it is not reasonably to be thought that A would not recognise the Notice of Arbitration or the rest of the numerous communications as documents written in English, and as significant documents from RCo (for example, at the very least, RCo’s name in English in the Notices of Arbitration would have been recognised from the same name in English in the monthly and daily statements, and by the time of the Notices of Arbitration, action by RCo to recover the outstanding balance of the Account must have been anticipated). If indeed A did not have a sufficient facility in English to read and understand the Notice of Arbitration or other documents, it was open to them to obtain assistance. The Applicants cannot deny notice of the arbitral proceedings by turning a blind eye to the documents received by email or by delivery in hard copy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 To sum up, the Applicants have not proved that they were not given proper notice of the arbitral proceedings.

If he is not so licensed, he will commit a criminal offence.

He adds that it is very common for members of the public in Hong Kong to be the clients of international firms which have no presence in Hong Kong, and which are neither licensed under the Ordinance nor required to be licensed under the Ordinance. The clients may have taken the initiative to seek out the services of the overseas firms or may have been referred to them on the recommendation of third parties, and these circumstances, he says, involve no holding out or active marketing in Hong Kong on the part of such overseas firms.

</div> but in the absence of more direct evidence from RCo’s side, that is a weak point. In the incomplete state of the evidence, the likelihood is that ACo was indeed referred by RCoHK to RCo for provision of the Facility, and that the Letter was signed in Hong Kong, and I proceed on that basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120  RCo’s business premises were in Singapore, and it did not have any business premises in Hong Kong. There was no evidence of any other business activity by RCo (as distinct from RCoHK) in Hong Kong, of margin financing or anything else, including any holding itself out in a business activity. Indeed, RCo’s CEO said squarely in his evidence that RCo “does not conduct any business in Hong Kong and does not conduct marketing activities for its services in Hong Kong”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Even if the Letter was signed in Hong Kong, there is no proper basis for concluding that there was marketing by RCo of its margin financing services to ACo, let alone to the public of Hong Kong, or that in agreeing to provide the Facility, RCo was carrying on a business in Hong Kong in that regulated activity or holding itself out as carrying on that business. The designation and use of Hong Kong dollars does not change that, nor the use of the Chinese language. Nor does the fact that ACo used the Facility for trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange help to make provision of the Facility an unlicensed business activity of RCo in Hong Kong (and I do not think that Mr Ang submitted that it did): that was ACo’s business, not RCo’s, as permitted but not required under the terms of the Facility. That ACo had an address in Hong Kong but no business premises in Singapore is not of material significance when asking where the business of the international financing transaction was carried out; of more significance is what was done in that transaction and where, but the fact that the Letter in a one-off transaction was signed in Hong Kong is not enough. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 To the assumptions on which Mr Tisdall came to his opinion that it was not necessary that RCo be licensed should be added that the Letter was signed in Hong Kong, but I do not think that materially affects his opinion. I conclude independently that in providing the Facility, RCo was not carrying on a business in a regulated activity in Hong Kong, or holding itself out in Hong Kong as carrying on such a business, including by active marketing to the public of Hong Kong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 It follows that the provision of the Facility was not illegal in Hong Kong, and that that basis for the ground falls away. I nonetheless go on to consider whether, if the provision of the Facility had been illegal in Hong Kong, there would have been conflict with the public policy of Singapore warranting setting the awards aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 It is well established that the ground in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b)</span>(ii) of the Model Law is a narrow ground. In <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi Jana Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi</span>”) at [59], the Court of Appeal said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the concept of public policy of the State is not defined in the Act or the Model Law, the general consensus of judicial and expert opinion is that public policy under the Act encompasses a narrow scope. In our view, it should only operate in instances where the upholding of an arbitral award would “shock the conscience” (see <span class="font-italic">Downer Connect</span> ([58] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [136]) or is “clearly injurious to the public good or … wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public” (see <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Schachbau v Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd </span>[1987] 2 Lloyds’ Rep 246 at 254, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sir John Donaldson MR), or where it violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality and justice: see <span class="font-italic">Parsons &amp; Whittemore Overseas Co Inc v Societe Generale de L’</span><span class="font-italic">Industrie du Papier (RAKTA) </span>508 F 2d 969 (2nd Cir, 1974) at 974. This would be consistent with the concept of public policy that can be ascertained from the preparatory materials to the Model Law. As was highlighted in the Commission Report (A/40/17), at para 297 (referred to in <span class="font-italic">A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial </span><span class="font-italic">Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary </span>by Howard M Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus (Kluwer, 1989) at p 914): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In discussing the term “public policy”, it was understood that it was not equivalent to the political stance or international policies of a State but comprised the fundamental notions and principles of justice… It was understood that the term “public policy”, which was used in the 1958 New York Convention and many other treaties, covered fundamental principles of law and justice in substantive as well as procedural respects. Thus, instances such as corruption, bribery or fraud and similar serious cases would constitute a ground for setting aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In <span class="font-italic">Sui Southern Gas Co Ltd v Habibullah Coastal Power Co (Pte) Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1 at [48], Judith Prakash J referred to a party having to cross a “very high threshold” and demonstrate “egregious circumstances such as corruption, bribery or fraud, which would violate the most basic notions of morality and justice” (see also <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other matters </span>[2020] 5 SLR 266 at [156]<span style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">–[159]</span><span style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 While in their submissions, the Applicants recognised the authority of <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi</span>, they submitted that what they called the principles in <span class="font-italic">Ralli Brothers v Companiera Naviera Sota Y Aznar </span>[1920] 2 KB 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Ralli Bros</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Soleimany v Soleimany </span>[1991] 1 QB 785 (“<span class="font-italic">Soleimany</span>”) should be applied in the present case.

It was held that the English court could reopen the Beth Din’s position as to illegality and that the interposition of an award despite illegality could not exclude consideration of illegality as going to English public policy. However, in <span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT </span>[2011] 4 SLR 739 (“<span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT</span>”), the Court of Appeal rejected the approach in <span class="font-italic">Soleimany </span>as to the more liberal circumstances in which the court may reopen an arbitral tribunal’s decision that an underlying contract is legal (at [58]<span style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">–</span>[60]); while the court is entitled to decide for itself whether the underlying contract is illegal and to set aside the award if tainted by illegality, it cannot correct findings of fact going to illegality (at [59] and [70]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As I understand the submission, it was that the principles in these cases were that the court should not assist or sanction the breach of the laws of other independent states (<span class="font-italic">Ralli </span><span class="font-italic">Bros</span>), including by declining to enforce an award made on a contract that was illegal under the laws of such a state (<span class="font-italic">So</span><span class="font-italic">leimany</span>) and so also by setting aside such an award.

</div> The award was made by the China Guangzhou Arbitration Commission, on a guarantee of certain sale contracts (at [3]). In the arbitration, the respondent alleged that the sale contracts were shams and were a façade for illegal moneylending, but the claim was upheld (at [4]). Section 95(3)(b) of the Arbitration Ordinance Cap 609 provided for refusal of enforcement if enforcement would be “contrary to public policy”. While acknowledging that the court of enforcement should not review the merits of the award, the Court considered it unclear whether the tribunal had thoroughly considered the issues of illegality raised by the respondent, and expressed “serious reservations” as to the reasons given by the tribunal for dismissing the respondent’s allegations (at [10]).

</div> An issue in the arbitration was whether a contract was illegal because it was in contravention of the Indian Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations (India) (at [129]). The tribunal held that they were not, and in an application to set the award aside Sir Vivian Ramsay IJ declined to intervene in that holding (at [192]). His Honour went on, however, to deal with the public policy ground in the Model Law on the assumption that the contracts were illegal. His discussion included (at [202]) that international comity did not mean that a contract illegal by the law of the country of performance would always not be enforced, or set aside, as a matter of Singapore public policy, and concluded, at [205]<span style="color: rgba(17,17,17,1)">–[206]</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">205. The relevant question is whether the illegality in the foreign state would demonstrate sufficiently egregious circumstances that would “shock the conscience” or violate the most basic notions of morality and justice so as to amount to a breach of Singapore public policy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">206. In the present case, there is no reason why a breach of the FEMA Regulations or the laws of India, without more, would “shock the conscience” or violate the “most basic notions of morality and justice”. If Mr Patnaik’s submissions are taken to their logical conclusion, then<span class="font-italic"> any</span> minor illegality or regulatory infringement by a contract in its place of performance would <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>lead to the conclusion that international comity, and thus Singapore public policy, would be breached so that the arbitral award would have to be set aside.

If illegality is found, it must be assessed for the offence to the public policy of Singapore of enforcement nonetheless, with the very high threshold to which the authorities refer. Mr Ang submitted that conducting a regulated activity without a licence is a criminal offence, and can bring a substantial penalty up to imprisonment for seven years or a fine of HKD 5m if there is conviction on indictment; and he said (although I think without a proper basis) that the illegality on RCo’s part was intentional.

</div> Where the law of Hong Kong, on the evidence before me, does not invalidate the provision of margin financing by an unlicensed provider, there is insufficient reason to hold that upholding the awards despite the illegality of the provision of the margin financing without a licence would shock the conscience, be clearly injurious to the public good, be wholly offensive to the reasonable and fully informed member of the public, violate Singapore’s most basic notion of morality and justice, or otherwise conflict with the public policy of Singapore in accordance with the authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Accordingly, had the provision of the Facility been illegal in Hong Kong, I would nonetheless not have set aside the awards on the ground of conflict with the public policy of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Convention of the Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 A’s affidavit on behalf of ACo foreshadowed a considerable number of contraventions of the Code,

There is also no reason why the parties to the contract could not choose Singapore law as the governing law, or some other law as is often done in commercial contracts even if the law is but remotely connected with the subject matter of the contract. There was nothing improper in these respects even remotely apt to bring conflict with the public policy of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 As I understand the other limb, it was said that the Code stated that the client agreement could not remove, exclude or restrict any rights of the client or obligations of the licensed or registered person under Hong Kong law; that the Code thereby denied the operation of the rules of the Singapore Stock Exchange or Singapore law to the extent that they did so; and therefore that the choices of the rules of the Singapore Stock Exchange and of Singapore law were improper.

</div> There is nothing to this limb of the submission either. To begin with, as earlier explained, the Code did not apply to RCo’s provision of the Facility. If it had applied, the consequence may have been to negate such terms of the contract under which the Facility was provided as in conflict with the Code; but the choice of law would not have been wholesale struck down, and again there was nothing improper even remotely apt to bring conflict with the public policy of Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The submission of unfairness seemed to rest upon there being a number of requirements of the Code which it was said were not found in the rules of the Singapore Stock Exchange: for example, it was said that the Code required a licensed or registered person to give the client a copy of the written agreement and all supporting documents in either English or Chinese according to the language preference of the client, and to draw the client’s attention to relevant risks, but the rules of the Singapore Stock Exchange did not have similar requirements.

A margin facility letter offered the opening and operation of a margin financing account on the terms set out therein, and was signed by the second applicant as the authorised signatory of the first applicant by way of acceptance. The acceptance of the margin facility letter included that the second applicant had read and understood the respondent’s terms and conditions for trading accounts, and that the second applicant would guarantee the margin financing account.

The respondent initiated the arbitral proceedings against the first applicant pursuant to the arbitration clause in the terms and conditions, incorporated by reference into the margin facility letter, and against the second applicant pursuant to the arbitration clause in the deed of guarantee and indemnity. The arbitral proceedings against the second applicant were later consolidated with separate arbitral proceedings brought against a third party, who also signed a guarantee of the first applicant’s payment obligations to the respondent under the margin financing facility, and the award in that arbitration was for their joint and several liability.

In the award against the second applicant, it was ordered that the second applicant and the third party were jointly and severally liable to the respondent for the same amount, plus interest and an amount for costs, subject to a similar reduction, and in the case of the third party, to a cap of HKD 100m. The tribunal subsequently issued corrections dated 19 March 2023 to both awards on its own initiative by way of email on 20 March 2023. The corrections recorded that the tribunal had become aware of miscalculations of the costs of the arbitrations, specifically as to the rate of the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) applied to the fees and expenses of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”). After the corrections, the amounts of the awards against either applicant did not change, as the changes were only in the component figures for SIAC’s fees and expenses, but not in the total amounts for those fees and expenses or in the amounts for the total costs of the arbitrations.</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The applicants then applied to court to set aside both awards, on the grounds that: (a) there was no valid arbitration agreement between the first applicant and the respondent; (b) the applicants were not given proper notice of the arbitral proceedings; and (c) the awards are contrary to the public policy of Singapore.
