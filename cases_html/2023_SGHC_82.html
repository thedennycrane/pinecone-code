I shall treat this phrase as intending to capture precisely the same meaning as the longer phrase by which Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule defines “foreign proceeding”: “a…proceeding…under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt”. The applicants do not, quite rightly, suggest that there is any difference in the meaning of the second <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> requirement and the longer definition in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) which it is intended to summarise.

The Cayman Act incorporates a comprehensive and integrated statutory scheme that was enacted to govern the liquidation of <span class="font-italic">all</span> Cayman companies, solvent <span class="font-italic">and</span> insolvent. It is therefore “a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>). Further, Art 2(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Third Schedule does not exclude a solvent company from the scope of the term “debtor” and therefore from the scope of the Third Schedule altogether. Similarly, Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) does not exclude a solvent liquidation from the scope of the term “foreign proceeding”. Indeed, both Arts 2(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) say nothing at all about the financial state of the company which is subject to the foreign proceeding.

Thus, a court may ascertain the purpose of a provision from its text and context in the written law (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, material intrinsic to the written law) and also from material which does not form part of the written law at all (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, material extrinsic to the written law): <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [42]. But in ascertaining the purpose of a provision, the court should accord primacy to intrinsic material over extrinsic material. The written law to be interpreted and applied is the text which Parliament has chosen to embody and give effect to its purpose. Parliament’s purpose should therefore, as far as possible, be derived from the text of the written law, read in context: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [43].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Types of extrinsic material</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Section 9A(2) of the IA provides that a court may consider “<span class="font-italic">any material</span> not forming part of the written law” [emphasis added] so long as it is “capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision” (see also <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [42] and [51]). Without limiting the generality of s 9A(2), s 9A(3) of the IA permits a court to consider six categories of extrinsic material in order to ascertain the legislative purpose of a provision. In particular, s 9A(3)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the IA permits the court to consider “any document that is declared by the written law to be a relevant document for the purposes of [s 9A of the IA].”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Section 252(2) of the IRDA provides that the following two documents are relevant for the purposes of s 9A(3)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the IA on the interpretation of any provision of the Third Schedule:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) any document relating to the Model Law that is issued by, or forms part of the record on the preparation of the Model Law maintained by, UNCITRAL and its working group for the preparation of the Model Law; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a specific document issued by UNCITRAL in 1997 bearing the title, <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: Guide to Enactment of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency</span>, 30th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/442 (1997) (“the 1997<span class="font-italic"> </span>Guide”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In 2013, UNCITRAL revised the 1997 Guide and promulgated the <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with Guide to Enactment and Interpretation</span> (2013) (“the 2013 Guide”). Am I empowered to consider the 2013 Guide in the purposive interpretation of Third Schedule even though s 252(2) of the IRDA refers expressly and only to the 1997 Guide? It is true that the 2013 Guide was published several years <span class="font-italic">before</span> Singapore adopted the Model Law and enacted s 252(2)’s predecessor, the now-abolished s 354B(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed)”). One could therefore take the view that Parliament’s decision to refer only to the 1997 Guide in s 252(2) of the IRDA and its statutory predecessor was a considered decision, and indicating by necessary implication a legislative intent to prohibit any consideration of the 2013 Guide as extrinsic material in a purposive interpretation of the Third Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I do not consider this to be the correct view. In my view, the 2013 Guide is part of the extrinsic material which a court can consider for this purpose. I say that for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 First, the scheme of s 9A of the IA is that the list of categories of extrinsic material enumerated in s 9A(3)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) is inclusive and not exhaustive. That is why the chapeau of s 9A(3) concludes with the words “shall <span class="font-italic">include</span>” [emphasis added]. Further, the opening words of s 9A(3) provide expressly that its list of six categories is not intended to limit the generality of s 9A(2) of the IA. As I have already mentioned, s 9A(2) is expressed in the widest possible terms (as manifested by the words “<span class="font-italic">any</span> material”). The only limitation in s 9A(2) is the obvious one: the extrinsic material must be “capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision”. The 2013 Guide, as an official UNCITRAL publication, is undoubtedly capable of assisting in the interpretation of the provisions of the Third Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Second, I accept Aedit Abdullah J’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others (Asia Aviation Holdings Pte Ltd, intervener) </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1343 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet</span>”) that it promotes consistency and comity for the Singapore courts to consider the 2013 Guide in the purposive interpretation of the Third Schedule (at [37]). This imperative, as Abdullah J points out in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet</span>, comes from Art 8 of the Third Schedule. That article requires the Singapore courts to interpret the Model Law, as enacted in the Third Schedule, having regard to its international origin and the need to promote uniformity in its application. This imperative also leads me to conclude that Parliament cannot have intended s 252(2) of the IRDA to freeze the universe of extrinsic material which the Singapore courts can legitimately consider in the purposive interpretation of the Third Schedule, regardless of the updates or additions to that universe of material. Parliament’s purpose in enacting the Model Law was to facilitate cooperation and coordination between the courts of Singapore and courts outside Singapore in a proceeding covered by the Third Schedule. That suggests that Parliament intended the Singapore courts to facilitate cooperation and coordination by interpreting and applying the Third Schedule in a manner consistent with prevailing international norms and practices. In a field such as cross-border insolvency, it is inevitable that those norms and practices will evolve over time. Parliament must have intended the courts to gather those norms and practices from the universe of extrinsic material that is available at the time they interpret and apply the Third Schedule, not merely the specific extrinsic material enumerated in s 252(2) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The express reference to the 1997 Guide in s 252(2) of the IRDA must nevertheless be given <span class="font-italic">some</span> meaning. As Abdullah J points out in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet</span>, this reference indicates Parliament’s intention that, if there is an inconsistency between the 1997 Guide and the 2013 Guide, the 1997 Guide must prevail. But if there is no such inconsistency, there is no reason to ignore the 2013 Guide and every reason to take it into account. Further, like Abdullah J, I do not consider there to be an inconsistency between the two guides for this purpose if the 2013 Guide takes a positive position on an issue on which 1997 Guide is silent. I consider there to be an inconsistency for this purpose only if both Guides take positive and conflicting positions on the same issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Purposes to which extrinsic material may be put</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Once the universe of extrinsic material which the court may legitimately consider in the purposive interpretation of the Third Schedule has been delimited, the question which arises is the legitimate use to which the court may put that extrinsic material in carrying out the purposive interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The IA permits the court to use extrinsic material only to achieve one of the three objectives set out in s 9A(2) of the IA: (a) to confirm the ordinary meaning of the provision; (b) to resolve a patent ambiguity; or (c) to ascertain the meaning of the provision where the ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd.

Only ss 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are true deeming provisions. The effect of those two provisions is to deem proof of a single objective factual predicate as establishing that a company is unable to pay its debts. These provisions are incapable of functioning as a test of insolvency of general applicability. That is because they cannot apply outside the context of contemplated insolvency proceedings (s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) or concluded civil proceedings (s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). Only s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) sets out a test of insolvency which is capable of general application: <span class="font-italic">BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL plc and others</span> [2013] 1 WLR 1408 (“<span class="font-italic">BNY v </span><span class="font-italic">Eurosail</span>”) at [24]–[25] and [35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The Court of Appeal analysed the content of this test in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> <span class="font-italic">Power Pte Ltd v RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tong </span><span class="font-italic">Teik Pte Ltd) </span>[2021] 2 SLR 478 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>”).  The statutory provision which the Court of Appeal considered there was s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed), the predecessor in near-identical terms of s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Court of Appeal noted that s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) is framed in the present tense. It therefore tests the company’s present ability to pay its debts (<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [62]). A company is obviously insolvent on this test if, on the date at which the test is applied, it cannot pay the debts which have already fallen due. But, as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>, a company is also insolvent on this test if it is unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due into the “reasonably near future”: <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [65] and [66]. For the typical company in the typical case, and following standard accounting practice, the “reasonably near future” for this purpose is 12 months: <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 A company is therefore insolvent under Singapore’s law if, and only if, it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due at present <span class="font-italic">and</span> into the reasonably near future, defined in accordance with the standard accounting definition as the next 12 months, bearing in mind when its current liabilities will fall due and how long it will need to realise its current assets: <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>at [56], [65] and [66].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Insolvency for the purposes of the Third Schedule</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The test in s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA as analysed in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> is the test of insolvency in Singapore law. This is not directly relevant to the meaning of “insolvency” for the purposes of the definition of “foreign proceedings” in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>). The subject of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) is a “proceeding in a foreign State”. It could be argued that the proper characterisation of that proceeding must necessarily take into account, at least as one of many factors, the law of that foreign State. In this case, that points to Cayman law, not Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Fortunately, it appears that there is no material difference between the concept of insolvency under Cayman law and the concept of insolvency under Singapore law. Section 93(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Cayman Act is the analogue of s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, and provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Definition of inability to pay debts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">93</span>.

Those 18 words trace their origin back to s 80(4) of the Companies Act 1862 (c 89) (UK) (<span class="font-italic">BNY v </span><span class="font-italic">Eurosail</span> at [27]). The phrase “as they fall due” is understood to be implicit in this test (<span class="font-italic">BNY v </span><span class="font-italic">Eurosail </span>at [30]). Both Cayman law and Singapore law therefore appear to adopt the same statutory test of insolvency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Unlike s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, s 93(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Cayman Act does not expressly require the court to take into account contingent and prospective liabilities in applying the statutory test of insolvency. However, neither party before me suggests that this is a material difference. As Lord Walker held in <span class="font-italic">BNY </span><span class="font-italic">v Eurosail </span>(at [37]), the substance of this statutory test of insolvency did not change in English law even though its statutory form changed significantly between 1862 and 1986.  In 1862, the statutory test in English law was identical to s 93(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Cayman Act. In 1986, the statutory test in English law was amended to incorporate the words “as they fall due” and an express provision requiring the court to take into account the company’s contingent and prospective liabilities. These statutory changes merely codified the manner in which the English judges had interpreted and applied the statutory test of insolvency found in the 1862 statute. In any case, since the applicants have taken no steps to rely on or prove the test for insolvency under Cayman law, it is open to me to presume that the test for insolvency in Cayman law is the same as it is in Singapore law: <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [58].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On its ordinary meaning, therefore, “insolvency” in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) means a company’s inability to pay debts which have already fallen due or which will fall due within the reasonably near future.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The meaning of “law”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I accept that the word “law” is not capable of exhaustive or even formal definition. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “law” as “a system of rules which a particular country or community recognises as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties”. That suffices as a working definition for present purposes. I would add to this only two points. First, that the rules may also be enforced by awarding compensation and by declaring rights or liabilities as well as by imposing penalties. Second, the penalties must be imposed through the country’s public institutions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> by way of civil orders or judgments or criminal sentences) and not through private or social means (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by way of shame or ostracism). Systems of rules which impose private or social penalties no doubt exist, but they are not law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the modern state, established with the now-typical separation of powers, it is the role of the legislature to make the rules which constitute its “law”. It is also now generally accepted that a country’s judiciary, in the course of performing its judicial function of resolving disputes, also performs a law-making function, albeit a limited one and one which is subject to substantial externally imposed and self-imposed constraints. This is most obviously true in common law jurisdictions but is also true, albeit to a much smaller extent, in civil law jurisdictions. In a functional sense then, even if not in a constitutional sense, the legislature and the judiciary together are the public institutions that, in a modern state, make “law”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I therefore accept that, for the purposes of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>), “law” includes both legislation and judge-made law. This view is supported by the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford International Bank Ltd</span> [2010] 3 WLR 941 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span> (EWCA)”). In that case, Sir Andrew Morritt LJ said (at [24]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would start with the phrase “pursuant to a law relating to insolvency” for this governs all the other factors. <span class="font-italic">It is contended that such law does not have to be statutory. I agree.</span> … The law of England and Wales relates to insolvency in the sense that it includes the Insolvency Act but unless the proceeding in question is taken under that Act (or some similar jurisdiction) it cannot sensibly be described as “pursuant to a law relating to insolvency”. So it is necessary, in my view, to start by identifying the law, <span class="font-italic">whether statutory or not</span>, under or pursuant to which the relevant proceeding was brought and is being pursued. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any case, it is common ground that the Cayman Act, under which Ascentra’s liquidation is proceeding, is “law” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule. What divides the parties is how broadly or narrowly the word “law” is to be construed in that Article. Specifically, whether “law” should be construed broadly as referring to the entire Cayman Act or more narrowly to a coherent and sufficiently discrete subset of provisions in the Cayman Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The answer to that question, to my mind, turns on the meaning of the phrase “relating to”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The meaning of “relating to”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The applicants submit that the phrase “relating to” must be construed broadly, such that a “law” under which a proceeding has been commenced “relates to” the subject-matter of “insolvency” if the law has any type of formal nexus with insolvency. For instance, the applicants suggest that it is conceptually possible for a statutory provision permitting a person to wind up a company on the just and equitable ground to be a law “relating to” insolvency, if that provision is located within a statute which deals generally with the subject matter of insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I do not accept the applicants’ submission. It subordinates substance entirely to form. If the applicants are correct, then any type of proceeding, no matter how far removed it may be from any connection to insolvency, would be “a … proceeding … under a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) simply because that proceeding is commenced under a provision which happens to be found in a statute which also deals generally with insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The extent to which this approach subordinates substance entirely to form can be illustrated by an example. Until July 2020, corporate insolvency in Singapore was governed by the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed). On the applicants’ approach, therefore, the entire Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) was until 2020 “a law relating to insolvency”. Section 216 of the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) grants a shareholder a right to seek relief from the court on the ground that the affairs of a company are being conducted oppressively. On the applicants’ approach, a proceeding under s 216 was “a…proceeding…under a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) simply because s 216 was until 2020 located in the same Act as our corporate insolvency provisions were located. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Assume that a shareholder had commenced proceedings in 2019 under s 216 of the Companies Act (2007 Rev Ed) and had succeeded in securing relief under s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) authorising the shareholder to commence civil proceedings in the name of and on behalf of the company. Assume further, that the shareholder had secured an order authorising him to represent the company in commencing the proceedings in a foreign court, thus making the shareholder a “foreign representative” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Third Schedule. On the applicants’ approach, and even if s 216 proceedings had nothing to do with a liquidation of the company, the order under s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) would be an order made “under a law relating to insolvency”. But nobody has ever suggested, rightly in my view, that a proceeding under s 216 of the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) which cannot conceivably involve a company being wound up is a proceeding under a law “relating to” insolvency within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is no answer to say that this s 216 proceeding would have fallen outside the scope of the Third Schedule because it would have failed the first <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> requirement (see [22(a)] above), <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that it did not involve creditors collectively. Although it is obviously true that this proceeding does not involve creditors collectively, that is not the true reason that it falls outside the scope of the Third Schedule. It falls outside the Third Schedule because it does not involve creditors <span class="font-italic">at all</span>. In other words, the true reason this proceeding falls outside the scope of the Third Schedule is that it has absolutely nothing to do with insolvency whatsoever. It simply is not a proceeding under a law relating to insolvency. That is so even if, when it was commenced in 2019, the Companies Act incorporated in Part X a comprehensive and integrated statutory scheme enacted to govern the liquidation of <span class="font-italic">all</span> Singapore companies, solvent <span class="font-italic">and</span> insolvent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I therefore cannot accept that the ordinary meaning of the words “relating to” is as broad as the applicants submit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The ordinary meaning of the words “under a law relating to insolvency”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Interpreted in its entirety, the plain language of the phrase “under a law relating to insolvency” must, in my view, refer to a body of rules, whether statutory or judge-made, which governs a company that is insolvent. Because assessing a company’s solvency or insolvency has an element of futurity to the analysis (<span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span> at [65]), this includes a company which apprehends being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the reasonably near future, and therefore can be said to be in severe financial distress in the present. It would go against the ordinary meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule to hold, as the applicants submit I should, that it suffices for the relevant body of rules under which the foreign proceeding is taking place simply by happenstance to be located in a statute that also contains governing insolvency generally. The inquiry into this requirement must ultimately be one of substance, not form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The following hypotheticals which I put to the applicants’ counsel in the course of oral submissions serve to strengthen my conclusion. Assume that X Inc, a solvent corporation, is in liquidation in Ruritania. Assume further that the liquidator seeks to have that liquidation recognised in Singapore as a foreign proceeding. In which of these examples is that proceeding “under a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of the Third Schedule?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ruritania has two separate statutes governing corporate liquidation and dissolution. The first is the Solvent Liquidations Act and governs the liquidation and dissolution of a solvent company. The second is called the Insolvent Liquidation Act and governs the liquidation and dissolution of insolvent companies. X Inc’s liquidation is taking place under the Solvent Liquidations Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ruritania has a single statute governing all corporate liquidations and dissolutions. It is called the Liquidations Act. Part I of the Liquidations Act governs the liquidation and dissolution of a solvent company. Part II of the Liquidations Act governs the liquidation and dissolution of insolvent companies. X Inc’s liquidation is taking place under Part I of the Liquidations Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ruritania has a single statute governing all aspects of its law of companies, including but not limited to the liquidation and dissolution of companies. It is called the Corporations Act. Part X of the Corporations Act governs the liquidation and dissolution of all corporations. Part X is divided into five divisions. Divisions 1 and 4 set out general provisions which apply to all liquidations of all companies, whether ordered by the court or initiated by shareholders and whether of a solvent company or of an insolvent company. Division 2 governs the court-ordered liquidation of companies, primarily but not exclusively on grounds of insolvency. Division 3 governs the shareholder-initiated liquidation of both solvent and insolvent companies. Division 5 governs the liquidation of foreign companies on grounds of insolvency.  Division 3 is subdivided into four subdivisions. The first and fourth subdivisions set out general provisions which apply to all shareholder-initiated liquidations. The second subdivision governs the shareholder-initiated liquidation of a solvent company. The third subdivision governs the shareholder-initiated liquidation of an insolvent company. X Inc’s liquidation is taking place under the provisions of Part X which apply: (a) only to the liquidation of solvent companies; (b) to all shareholder-initiated liquidations; and (c) to the liquidation of all companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The applicants accept that X Inc’s liquidation in the first hypothetical under the Solvent Liquidations Act would not be a proceeding “under a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>). This must be correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 But on the applicants’ case, X Inc’s liquidation in the second and third hypotheticals would be “under a law relating to insolvency”. The submission is that that is because the provision which X Inc invoked to commence its solvent liquidation is located in a statute which sets out a unified structure of insolvency laws. Indeed, the third hypothetical in fact describes the structure of the liquidation provisions of the Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK). That Act is the model for both the Cayman Act and also for our Companies Act (Cap 50, 1985 Rev Ed) (via the Companies Act 1965 (No 79 of 1965) (M’sia)) from the time it was enacted in 1967 until our provisions relating to corporate insolvency were decanted into the IRDA in 2020. This continues broadly to be the structure of the provisions relating to liquidation in Part 8 of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I have great difficulty in accepting the applicants’ submission. In my view, the only distinction between the first hypothetical on the one hand and the second and third hypotheticals on the other is one of form. The applicants cannot explain why the conclusions ought to differ simply because the relevant “law” takes a different form. It is to my mind entirely artificial for the test in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule to turn simply on the form of the relevant “law”.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Even if I am wrong, and even if the phrase “a law relating to insolvency” can be construed as including a body of law which does not govern insolvency in itself but which in form is part of a unified structure of insolvency law, this simply establishes that that is a possible alternative meaning of the phrase. It does not establish that the phrase cannot be construed as body of law that governs only a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 If that is the case, s 9A(2) of the IA empowers me to consider extrinsic material to interpret this provision of the Third Schedule purposively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The effect of s 252 of the IRDA is to give the Model Law the force of law in Singapore in the form it appears in the Third Schedule.

This culminated in the promulgation of the Model Law in 2007: Richard Sheldon QC,<span class="font-italic"> Cross-Border Insolvency </span>(Bloomsbury Publishing, 4th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Sheldon on Cross-Border Insolvency</span>”) at para 3.1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Model Law was conceived to advance the principle of modified universalism (see Roy Goode &amp; Kristin Van Zwieten, <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode on Insolvency Law</span>”) at para 16–07). This principle holds that national courts should, as far as is consistent with justice and the public policy of the state which has established that court, strive to administer the estate of an insolvent company in cooperation with the courts in the country of the principal liquidation, to ensure that all of the company’s assets are distributed to its creditors under a single system of distribution: see <span class="font-italic">In re</span><span class="font-italic"> HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd </span>[2008] 1 WLR 852 at [6]–[7]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Modified universalism finds expression in the Model Law through four key principles (see <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL </span><span class="font-italic">Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: The Judicial Perspective</span>, UNCITRAL (2022) at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The “Access Principle”: a “foreign representative” must be given rights of access to the recognising court in the foreign state to seek recognition and relief in support of the insolvency proceeding in the home state. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The “Recognition Principle”: foreign proceedings which qualify for recognition may be recognised by the recognising court, either as a “main” or “non-main” proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The “Relief Principle”: upon (or in anticipation of) recognising a foreign proceeding, interim, automatic and/or discretionary relief must be available to protect the assets of a debtor within the recognising court’s jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The “Cooperation and Coordination Principle”: courts and insolvency representatives across different jurisdictions must communicate and cooperate to ensure that the debtor’s insolvency estate is administered fairly and efficiently, with a view to maximising benefits for creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Model Law gives effect to these four principles through a procedural framework which not only permits but encourages cooperation and coordination between jurisdictions in cases of cross-border insolvencies: see <span class="font-italic">Goode on Insolvency Law </span>at para 16–07. For instance, Art 20(1) of the Model Law mandates an automatic moratorium on creditor action upon a court recognising a foreign proceeding as a foreign main proceeding. The moratorium facilitates the fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies or reorganisations to preserve or maximise value for creditors and other stakeholders and reduces the likelihood that the debtor can successfully conceal or dissipate assets: <span class="font-italic">Sheldon on Cross-Border Insolvency </span>at para 3.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Model Law provides the procedural tools necessary for national courts to put in place a global collective regime for the benefit of creditors as a class. In the absence of a collective regime, each creditor would move quickly to seize the debtor’s assets and gain an advantage over other creditors. The Model Law thus permits courts to consolidate the administration and resolution of an insolvency or rehabilitation in the court of the foreign main proceeding, and to seek relief in other courts to preserve or even enhance value for creditors collectively until the main proceeding concludes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The purposes of the Model Law are in no way engaged when recognition is sought of a foreign proceeding involving a company which is neither insolvent nor in severe financial distress, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a solvent company such as Ascentra. None of the concerns or risks which arise in the case of a company which is insolvent or in severe financial distress are even remotely present when a solvent company goes into liquidation. Indeed, given that the assets of the company will, by definition, suffice to pay all creditors in full, there will be no scramble for the company’s assets, domestically or across a border. And no creditor can gain an advantage over other creditors by rushing to judgment. There is simply no justification for imposing an automatic moratorium on actions against a company under Art 20 of the Model Law, thereby denying the company’s creditors access to the courts. So too, many of the other forms of discretionary relief available under Art 21 of the Model Law make no sense in the context of a solvent company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I therefore hold that construing “law relating to solvency” as including laws governing the liquidation of a solvent company is not necessary to promote the purposes of the Third Schedule. Indeed, for the reasons given below, I accept that it is the intent of the Model Law expressly to exclude the liquidation of solvent companies from the scope of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I now turn to consider the preparatory records and documents that reveal the intention of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The preparatory records and documents</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Working Group papers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The first document I consider is the “Cross-Border Insolvency: Report on UNCITRAL–INSOL Colloquium on Cross-Border Insolvency”, UNCITRAL, Colloquium on Cross-Border Insolvency, 27th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/398 (1994) (“the 1994 Colloquium Report”). That report records the discussions at a colloquium held in Vienna in 1994. The subject of the Colloquium was the desirability and feasibility of developing legal mechanisms to recognise cross-border insolvency proceedings. In that sense, the report records the foundational discussions that eventually resulted in the promulgation of the Model Law. Paragraph 4 of the 1994 Colloquium Report points out that the purpose of developing these legal mechanisms was to preserve or enhance value for the creditors of a company which was insolvent or in severe financial distress, whether through rehabilitation or liquidation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Emphasis was placed [during the Colloquium] on the corresponding need to develop legal mechanisms for limiting the extent to which, in the event of <span class="font-italic">insolvency</span> in a cross-border context, disparities in and conflicts between national laws created unnecessary obstacles to the achievement of the basic economic and social objectives of <span class="font-italic">insolvency</span> proceedings.

This report records the discussions at a colloquium held in Toronto in 1995. The position taken was that the proceedings to be recognised should involve only a company that was insolvent. The reason was that different legal systems treat proceedings involving solvent companies differently. It was therefore more difficult to harmonise the treatment of solvent liquidations (at para 19):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As to the type of proceedings to be recognized, a view was expressed that <span class="font-italic">the provisions should be limited to proceedings in which the debtor was </span><span class="font-italic">actually insolvent</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Finally, the UNCITRAL Working Group on Insolvency Law considered issues relating to the definition and scope of “foreign proceeding” in a series of reports on its various sessions (see the “Report of the Working Group on Insolvency Law on the work of its eighteenth session”, UNCITRAL, Working Group V: Insolvency Law, 18th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/419 (1995), “Report of the Working Group on Insolvency Law on the work of the nineteenth session”, UNCITRAL, Working Group V: Insolvency Law, 19th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/422 (1996), and “Report of the Working Group on Insolvency Law on the work of the twenty-first session”, UNCITRAL, Working Group V: Insolvency Law, 21st Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/435 (1997)). The consensus was that the definition of “foreign proceeding” and “insolvency” should remain broad to facilitate the recognition of proceedings that may not necessarily fall within the definition of insolvency proceedings under the insolvency law of the recognising jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The applicants submit that these documents support taking a broad and inclusive approach to the types of foreign proceeding that are eligible for recognition under the Third Schedule.

It does not follow from the intention to adopt a broad and inclusive approach for the Model Law’s recognition framework that it was <span class="font-italic">also</span> intended to include even a solvent liquidation within the meaning of “foreign proceeding”. In my view, the definition of “foreign proceeding” was to be broad in order to prevent a proceeding commenced under a law that was <span class="font-italic">functionally</span> applicable to companies that are insolvent or in severe financial distress from falling outside the scope of the Model Law, even though that law was not framed in a way in which the recognising court would expect it to be framed.

</div>
</div> I do not agree. It is notable that the 1997 Guide describes the term “insolvency” as referring to collective proceedings applying to “insolvent debtors” (at para 51):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">“Insolvency”</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51. The word "insolvency", as used in the title of [the Model Law], refers to various types of collective proceedings against <span class="font-italic">insolvent debtors</span>. The reason is that the Model Law … covers proceedings concerning different types of debtors and, among those proceedings, deals with proceedings aimed at reorganizing the debtor and proceedings leading to a liquidation of the debtor as a commercial entity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 While I accept the applicants’ submission that the Model Law has adopted a broad and inclusive approach toward the types of foreign proceeding that may be recognised under the Model Law, I consider that they intended to draw the net as widely as possible only in order to bring within it all types of proceedings relating to companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress. I do not consider that it was at any time intended to draw the net so widely as to bring within it proceedings relating to a solvent company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I turn next to consider the position set out in the 2013 Guide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The 2013 Guide goes further than the 1997 Guide. It states, in clear terms and consistently with the 1997 Guide, two aspects of the Model Law when it come to the definition of “foreign proceeding”. The first relates to the type of companies covered by the Model Law. The 2013 Guide states that assistance under the Model Law’s recognition framework is intended to be granted only to companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress (at para 49):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49. Debtors covered by the Model Law would generally fall within the scope of the <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law</span> and would therefore be eligible for commencement of insolvency proceedings in accordance with recommendations 15 and 16 of the <span class="font-italic">Legislative Guide</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">being debtors that are or will be generally unable to pay their debts as they mature or whose liabilities exceed the value of their assets</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The second relates to the nature of the foreign proceeding sought to be recognised. The 2013 Guide clarifies that the term “insolvency proceedings” in covers companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress (at para 65):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Subparagraph </span>(a)<span class="font-italic"> – Foreign proceeding</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65. … the expression “insolvency proceedings” may have a technical meaning in some legal systems, but is intended in subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(a)</span> to refer broadly to proceedings involving debtors that are in severe financial distress or insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Accordingly, the 2013 Guide makes explicit that the Model Law is not concerned with a judicial or administrative process that focuses solely on dissolving a solvent company (at paras 48 and 73):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Use of the term “insolvency”</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48. … as used in the Model Law, the word “insolvency” relates to various types of collective <span class="font-italic">proceedings commenced with respect to debtors that are in severe financial distress or insolvent</span>. … <span class="font-italic">A judicial or administrative proceeding to wind up a solvent entity where the goal is to dissolve the entity and other foreign proceedings not falling within article 2 subparagraph </span>(a)<span class="font-italic"> are not insolvency proceedings within the scope of the Model Law</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(ii) </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pursuant to a law relating to insolvency</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73. … A simple proceeding for a solvent legal entity that does not seek to restructure the financial affairs of the entity, but rather <span class="font-italic">to dissolve its legal status, is likely not one pursuant to a law relating to insolvency or severe financial distress</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The 1997 Guide and 2013 Guide read together show that it is not the intent of the Model Law to include within the meaning of the phrase “foreign proceeding” a proceeding which has, as its ultimate objective, the dissolution of a solvent company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In my view, the views manifest in these documents are consistent with the overarching purpose of the Model Law. In particular, subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(e)</span> of the Model Law’s Preamble (which is the same as subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(e)</span> of the Third Schedule’s preamble) states that one of the Model Law’s purposes is to facilitate the rescue of financially distressed businesses:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of [the Model Law] is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross-border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) <span class="font-italic">f</span><span class="font-italic">acilitation of the rescue of financially troubled businesses</span>, thereby protecting investment and preserving employment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Indeed, the 2013 Guide notes that subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(e)</span> of the Model Law’s Preamble puts the Model Law’s focus on “severely financially distressed and insolvent debtors” and “laws that prevent or address the financial distress of those debtors” (at para 67):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67. As noted in subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(e)</span> of the preamble, the focus of the Model Law is upon severely financially distressed and insolvent debtors and the laws that prevent or address the financial distress of those debtors. … these are … debtors that are or will be generally unable to pay their debts as they mature or whose liabilities exceed the value of their assets …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I make one final point in relation to the applicants’ submission that Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule, including the phrase “under the law relating to insolvency”, is worded so broadly that it would be incorrect to exclude from the scope of the Third Schedule a company which is neither insolvent nor in severe financial distress (see [84] above). The 2013 Guide makes clear that the intent of this phrase was to avoid unduly restricting the scope of <span class="font-italic">insolvency</span> proceedings recognised under the Model Law. This is regardless of the sources of law in which such rules are contained and whether those sources dealt exclusively with insolvency (at para 73):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(ii) </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pursuant to a law relating to insolvency</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73. This formulation is used in the Model Law to acknowledge the fact that liquidation and reorganization might be conducted under law that is not labelled as insolvency law (e.g. company law), but which nevertheless deals with or addresses insolvency or severe financial distress. The purpose was to find a description that was sufficiently broad to encompass a range of insolvency rules irrespective of the type of statute or law in which they might be contained and irrespective of whether the law that contained the rules related exclusively to insolvency. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I therefore conclude, from considering these extrinsic materials, that the purpose of the Model Law is to empower a recognising court to extend recognition to a foreign proceeding the subject of which is a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress. This conclusion is also consistent with, and indeed confirms that, the ordinary meaning of the words “under a law relating to insolvency” refers to a law that prescribes a set of procedures that apply to a company that is either insolvent or in severe financial distress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I turn next to consider the case law interpreting the phrase “foreign proceeding” as found in national adaptations of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The case law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The position in Singapore law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I begin with the applicants’ submission that <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> supports, <span class="font-italic">sub silentio</span>, their argument that nothing in the Third Schedule precludes the recognition of a foreign proceeding involving a solvent company. The applicants’ submission proceeds as follows. <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> was one of the first cases under the Third Schedule. The Court of Appeal therefore took special care when setting out its views on the requirements for recognition. Despite this, when it analysed the phrase “under a law relating to insolvency”, the Court of Appeal did not expressly discuss or consider any requirement that a company seeking recognition under the Third Schedule be insolvent or in severe financial distress. The Court of Appeal would not have overlooked a threshold requirement as fundamental as this. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">United Securities </span>implicitly include a solvent liquidation within the meaning of the phrase “foreign proceeding” in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I do not accept this submission. There was no dispute that the company in <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> was insolvent. The Court of Appeal therefore did not have to consider whether the Third Schedule distinguishes between solvent and insolvent companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span>, a company was being wound up in Malaysia. A bank commenced parallel civil proceedings against the company in Singapore and in Malaysia to determine its rights and obligations under a loan agreement and a deed of debenture. The company applied in Singapore under the Third Schedule for recognition of both the winding up proceedings in Malaysia and the bank’s civil litigation against the company in Malaysia. The company also sought a stay of the Singapore civil proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The High Court declined to recognise the bank’s civil litigation in Malaysia, but did recognise the Malaysian winding up proceeding as a “foreign main proceeding”. Despite this, the High Court refused to stay the civil litigation in Singapore against the company, under both Arts 20 and 21 of the Third Schedule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Court of Appeal dismissed the company’s appeal. Even though the Malaysian winding up proceeding was entitled to recognition as a “foreign main proceeding”, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that it was appropriate to grant the bank leave to proceed with the Singapore civil litigation. Accordingly, there was no need to determine whether the bank’s Malaysian civil litigation could be recognised under the Third Schedule.

By then, it was well settled in US bankruptcy law was that a foreign solvent liquidation was a “foreign proceeding”. Indeed, the applicants submit that this position was well entrenched even before the enactment of the Model Law under Chapter 15, as evident by the US Bankruptcy Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Petition of the Board of Directors of Hopewell International Insurance Ltd</span> 238 BR 25 (NY United States Bankruptcy Court, 1999). In that case, the US Bankruptcy Court granted ancillary relief to a foreign solvent debtor that was undergoing a scheme of arrangement in Bermuda. In granting this relief, the US Bankruptcy Court held that the foreign solvent debtor’s scheme of arrangement qualified as a “foreign proceeding” under s 101(23) of Chapter 15. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The applicants thus submit that Parliament must be taken to have been aware of the US Bankruptcy Court’s decisions on this issue.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I do not accept the applicants’ submission that the US authorities should be given special weight. First, in the absence of any direct evidence as to what Parliament intended, it is, to my mind, a leap of logic to say that the mere adoption of the words “adjustment of debt” from Chapter 15 indicates Parliament’s intention to adopt the approach under US bankruptcy law on the interpretation of the Third Schedule in general or on Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) in particular. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Second, and more pertinently, in so far as the US Bankruptcy Courts have accepted that a solvent liquidation may be recognised under Chapter 15, that approach does not carry any special weight in how the Singapore courts interpret Singapore’s adaptation of the Model Law in the Third Schedule. Indeed, the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor DD and in the matter of the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 </span>[2017] All ER (D) 83 (Nov) (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor</span>”) held, albeit with respect to the English adaptation of the Model Law under the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No 1030) (UK) (“the CBIR”), national courts should not slavishly follow the decisions of other national courts in so far as the latter’s construction of the relevant Model Law provision is based on different adaptations of the Model Law or do not accord with the relevant preparatory materials (at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nor should I slavishly follow the decisions of other countries’ courts where they are based on different adaptations of the Model Law or do not accord with the preparatory materials (reports of working groups) that led to the CBIR. In <span class="font-italic">Re Pan Ocean Co Ltd, </span><span class="font-italic">Fibria Cellulose S/A v Pan Ocean Co Ltd</span> [2014] EWHC 2124 (Ch), [2014] Bus LR 1041 Morgan J was asked to grant specific relief under (in particular) art 21 of the CBIR in a case where a Korean company was in an insolvency proceeding already recognised by the English court. The judge examined US authority but concluded that the words “any appropriate relief” in art 21 were not to be construed in the way that authority indicated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I accept that the approach taken by the US Bankruptcy Court is one of the approaches which I can consider to the issue at hand. But I do not consider it to be of any special weight in that exercise. Instead, as counsel for SPGK Singapore, Mr Ashok Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), points out, the issue before me must be decided bearing in mind the underlying intent of Parliament in enacting the Third Schedule. In my view, Parliament’s intention explicitly to prescribe the Model Law’s preparatory records and documents, as well as both the 1997 Guide (through s 354B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed)) and 2013 Guide (through the IA), as interpretative guides is telling. This is a strong indication that Parliament intends the courts to accord greatest weight in interpreting the Third Schedule to UNCITRAL’s materials.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I therefore accept that the modification made to Art 2(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law in enacting Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) the Third Schedule could not have been intended by Parliament to detract from Parliament’s underlying intent in enacting the Third Schedule. As I have set out above, this underlying intent is confined to companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress (see [85] and [95] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The approach under US bankruptcy law has been criticised</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I consider also that I am justified in attaching less weight to authorities from the US Bankruptcy Court because of the criticisms to which these authorities have been subjected by commentators and judges in other jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Before I turn to consider these criticisms, it is appropriate to first examine the position taken by these US cases in greater detail, starting with the chief decision on which the applicants rely: <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp Limited (in liquidation) </span>400 BR 266 (Nevada United States Bankruptcy Court, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 <span class="font-italic">Re Betcorp </span>involved an Australian company involved in online gaming. The company’s business was conducted through a variety of affiliate and subsidiary entities. Following the passing of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act 31 USC (2006) (US) in the United States, the company’s business model became unworkable. As a result, the company’s shareholders resolved to liquidate the company. Crucially, the company was solvent at the time the resolution was passed. The purpose of the dissolution was therefore to return value to the company’s shareholders by way of a share buy-back, following which the company would be dissolved by a members’ voluntary winding up carried out under Australian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Shortly after the shareholders had passed the necessary resolution, the claimant, a US patent holder, sued the company in the US for alleged patent infringement under US patent law. To stop the US patent infringement proceedings, the company’s liquidators applied in the US for recognition of the Australian members’ voluntary winding-up under Chapter 15. The application, if successful, would trigger an automatic stay of the US patent suit. Accordingly, one of the issues which the court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> addressed was whether the Australian members’ voluntary winding up was a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of s 101(23) of Chapter 15. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In recognising the Australian liquidation, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp </span>was satisfied that the members’ voluntary winding up in Australia fell within the meaning of a “foreign proceeding”. This was despite the winding up involving a solvent company. The court reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The requirement that the foreign proceeding be “under a law related to insolvency or the adjustment of debts” does not require the company to be either insolvent or to be contemplating the adjustment of debt (at pp 281–282). The court did not elaborate on why this was the case. Neither did the court refer to any of the Model Law’s preparatory documents in justifying its holding. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Accordingly, the court found that the company’s Australian voluntary winding up satisfied this requirement. It was commenced under Chapter 5 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (“Australian Corporations Act”), which also contained provisions that dealt with corporate insolvency and the adjustment of debts. The “unified structure” of the provisions governing these processes led the court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> to conclude that the members’ winding up was commenced under a law relating to insolvency or the adjustment of debt. Additionally, the court held that this finding was consistent with the Australian legislature’s intention that a company in voluntary winding up be treated as one being administered under a law relating to insolvency (at pp 281–283). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The applicants also refer me to several US decisions that have followed <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the phrase “under a law related to insolvency or the adjustment of debts” does not require the company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In <span class="font-italic">Re ABC Learning Centres Ltd </span>445 BR 318 (“<span class="font-italic">Re ABC Learning Centres</span>”), the US Bankruptcy Court held that the debtor company’s voluntary winding up in Australia was authorised and conducted pursuant to a law related to insolvency or the adjustment of debts. The court reasoned that since the Australian Corporations Act contained numerous provisions addressing corporate insolvency and the adjustment of corporate debt, it was sufficient that the winding up was initiated pursuant to that Act. As in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re ABC Learning Centres</span> did not discuss the underlying rationale of the Model Law or why it would be in accordance with that rationale to recognise a solvent liquidation as a “foreign proceeding”. It is crucial to note, however, that the company’s board of directors was of the view that the company was “likely to become insolvent” (<span class="font-italic">Re ABC Learning Centres</span> at p 324), thereby suggesting that the debtor company, while not insolvent, was nonetheless in severe financial distress.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In <span class="font-italic">Re Manley Toys Limited</span> 580 BR 632 (NJ United States Bankruptcy Court, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Re Manley Toys</span>”), the US Bankruptcy Court concluded that the debtor company’s voluntary liquidation in Hong Kong was a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of s 101(23) of Chapter 15. This was because the liquidation was commenced under the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32) (HK) which sets out the framework for liquidating a company. As such, the court was satisfied that the debtor company’s voluntary winding up was conducted under a law related to insolvency or adjustment of debts (at 638). It is crucial to note, however, that the debtor company went into voluntary liquidation because it was facing numerous legal actions and was also financially troubled owing to “alleged[ly] declining sales” (<span class="font-italic">Re Manley Toys</span> p at 635).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Mr Kumar submits that the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re ABC Learning Centre </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Manley Toys</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>should not be followed. He submits instead that the position taken by the English courts in <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon Central Asia Balanced Fund (in liquidation) Carter v Bailey and another</span><span class="font-italic"> (as foreign representatives of Sturgeon Central Asia Balanced Fund Ltd)</span> [2020] EWHC 123 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span>”) is the correct approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span>, a Bermudan company was wound up on just and equitable grounds under s 161 of the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda). The winding up application was brought following a breakdown in the basis on which the company was set up and with allegations that the investors had been denied their rights. Crucially, the company was solvent. The liquidators secured an order recognising the Bermudan liquidation in an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> hearing before the Companies Court (now part of the Insolvency and Companies List). The applicant, a former director of the company, applied to terminate the recognition order on the basis that the grounds for granting the order were lacking at the time it was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The issue which the English High Court had to consider was whether the solvent liquidation of the company was a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CBIR. Having referred to the Model Law’s Working Group’s reports and preparatory papers, Chief ICC Judge Briggs concluded that the Model Law’s purpose and object is to recognise and provide relief in respect of proceedings involving companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress (at [59]–[70]). Accordingly, it was contrary to the Model Law’s purpose and object to enlarge its scope by interpreting “foreign proceeding” as including solvent companies and proceedings which pay all creditors in full and produce a surplus for members (at [116]–[117]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For these reasons, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon </span>criticised the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> as a “wrong turn” in cross-border insolvency law by accepting that a solvent liquidation could fall within the Model Law when this was clearly not intended. Instead, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> should have gone “one step further to ask whether the company was insolvent or in severe financial distress” (<span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> at [121]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Having considered these authorities, I hold that the position taken by the US Bankruptcy Court as represented by <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> is, with respect, incorrect and should not be followed in Singapore. The correct position, in my view, is that stated in <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a solvent liquidation was not intended to and does not fall within the definition of a “foreign proceeding” in the Model Law. I say this for the following two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 First, taking the position in US law on its face, there is some doubt as to whether <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> and the subsequent decisions endorsing it are correct. Mr Kumar submits that the legislative intent behind the US adaptation of the Model Law and s 101(23) of Chapter 15 appears to cover only companies which are insolvent or in severe financial distress (see United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, <span class="font-italic">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act</span> <span class="font-italic">of 2005 </span>(House Report, HR Report Pub L No 109-31, 8 April 2005) at p 18). Mr Kumar also refers me to an academic commentary discussing the inclusion of the phrase “adjustment of debt” in s 101(23) of Chapter 15 as broadening the scope of the US adaptation of the Model Law to include debtors suffering from severe financial distress (see Jennifer Morton, “Recognition of Cross-Border Insolvency Proceedings: An Evaluation of Solvent Schemes of Arrangement and Part VII Transfers under US Chapter 15” (2006) 29 <span class="font-italic">Fordham International Law Journal</span> 1312 at 1339). </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">134 While it is not, of course, for me to express a view on US bankruptcy law, I accept that these secondary sources, at the very least, raise some doubt as to the correctness of the US position as stated in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Mr Kumar also submits that the US Bankruptcy Court’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Betcorp</span> based on the legislative history and the intent behind Australia’s adaptation of the Model Law is open to doubt. In particular, the US Bankruptcy Court did not give adequate consideration to the discussions set out in the Commonwealth of Australia, Parliament, <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: </span><span class="font-italic">Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Proposals for Reform: Paper No. 8 </span>(Report, 2002)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“the CLERP Paper”). The CLERP Paper expressly indicated that Australia did not intend to include a members’ voluntary winding up within the scope of Australia’s adaptation of the Model Law (at p 23):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the Australian Corporations Act context, that means the scope of the Model Law would extend to liquidations arising from insolvency, reconstructions and reorganisations under Part 5.1 and voluntary administrations under Part 5.3A. … <span class="font-italic">It would also not extend to a members’ voluntary winding up or a winding up by a court on just and equitable grounds as such proceedings may not be insolvency related</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 It therefore appears to me, with respect, that the US Bankruptcy Court’s interpretation of Australia’s adaptation of the Model Law is not entirely accurate (see Look Chan Ho (ed), <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: A Commentary on </span><span class="font-italic">the UNCITRAL Model Law</span> (Globe Law and Business Publishing, 4th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Commentary</span><span class="font-italic"> on UNCITRAL Model Law</span>”) at pp 186–187).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The applicants submit that less weight should be given to the CLERP Paper as it was merely a consultation document to facilitate gathering views on the Australian adaptation of the Model Law. Instead, greater weight should be given to the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Cross-Border Insolvency Bill 2008 (Cth) (which enacted the Model Law in Australia) (“the Explanatory Memorandum”). The US Bankruptcy Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> relied on the Explanatory Memorandum in concluding that a voluntary winding up was a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of s 101(23) of Chapter 15 (at 283). This was on the basis that Part 5.5 of Chapter 5 of the Australian Corporations Act governs voluntary winding up proceedings in Australia, and the Explanatory Memorandum does not exclude this part from the scope of Australia’s adaptation of the Model Law.

Specifically, the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Commentary</span><span class="font-italic"> on UNCITRAL Model Law</span> argue that, in considering the Explanatory Memorandum, the US Bankruptcy Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> failed to distinguish between a members’ voluntary winding up and a creditors’ voluntary winding up. The learned authors point out that, although both forms of winding up appear in Part 5.5 of Chapter 5 of the Australian Corporations Act, a creditors’ voluntary winding up is generally an insolvent liquidation and would understandably be included in the Australian implementation of the Model Law. This explains why the Explanatory Memorandum does not exclude Part 5.5 of Chapter 5 of the Australian Corporations Act entirely. However, it does not follow from this that a members’ voluntary winding up, which involves a solvent company, was also intended to be included in the Australian enactment of the Model Law (see <span class="font-italic">Commentary on UNCITRAL Model Law </span>at pp 187–188).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In any event, I accept that the question of whether a foreign proceeding fulfils the criteria for recognition is a question reserved for the recognising jurisdiction to be determined in accordance with its adaptation of the Model Law. The recognising court is not bound by the way in which the foreign proceeding is characterised in the jurisdiction in which it has been brought (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>at [34]). To that end, I accept that the US Bankruptcy Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> was entitled to come to its own view as to whether, applying Chapter 15, the Australian member’s voluntary winding up was a “foreign proceeding” under s 101(23) of Chapter 15. Having said that, I nevertheless accept that the criticisms levelled against <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> on this point is a factor weighing against my adoption of the position taken by the US Bankruptcy Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> and the cases which have followed it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Second, I do not accept the justification in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> that a proceeding initiated under a body of law which includes provisions for an insolvent liquidation, even if it involves a solvent company, is one that is commenced “under a law related to insolvency or the adjustment of debts”. This interpretation fails to give due regard to the ordinary meaning of those words which I have concluded (see [64] above) as referring to a rule, whether statutory or judge-made, that prescribes a set of procedures involving or applying to a company that is either insolvent or in severe financial distress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The learned authors in <span class="font-italic">Sheldon on Cross-Border Insolvency</span> also criticise the US Bankruptcy Court’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp </span>on the same point. In the authors’ view, the fact that the Part which includes provisions governing a members’ voluntary winding up in the Australian Corporations Act also include provisions for insolvent liquidation does not in itself “necessarily justify bringing within the Model Law’s scheme of recognition and assistance a proceeding in relation to a solvent company, the purpose of which includes the return of a surplus to members”. Further, the learned authors also point out that “there is no obvious justification for allowing creditors’ rights to be restrained by recognising a solvent liquidation as a foreign proceeding”: <span class="font-italic">Sheldon on Cross-Border Insolvency</span> at para 3.35; see also <span class="font-italic">Goode on Insolvency Law</span> at p 626. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I accept the views in <span class="font-italic">Sheldon on Cross-Border Insolvency</span> as consistent with the underlying purpose and intent of the Model Law. It may be that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> was made without the benefit of the clarifications provided in the 2013 Guide. However, the fact remains that the preparatory works and documents demonstrate UNCITRAL’s intent to confine the scope of a foreign proceeding recognised under the Model Law to one involving only a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress. As I have held, this is to facilitate either the orderly distribution of the assets of an insolvent company amongst its creditors or conceiving and implementing a successful reorganisation or business rescue plan of a company in severe financial distress (see [73] to [77] above). It is in this context that the benefits and reliefs afforded under the Model Law’s recognition framework should be granted, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to restrain creditors’ rights to, among other things, bring proceedings against the company. There is no concern that there will be a mad scramble amongst creditors for the assets of a solvent company. There is no justification for recognising a solvent liquidation as a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of the Model Law’s (and hence the Third Schedule’s) framework.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The English position in </span>Re Sturgeon <span class="font-italic">is not an </span><span class="font-italic">outlier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Finally, I do not accept the applicants’ submission that <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> is an outlier and should not be followed in Singapore. The applicants submit that <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> is an outlier because earlier English decisions did not restrict the nature of a “foreign proceeding” capable of recognition under the CBIR.

</div>
</div> These include the cases of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(EWCA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The applicants interpret these cases as supporting the view that a proceeding is brought “under a law relating to insolvency” if insolvency is one of the grounds on which the proceeding can be commenced, even if insolvency cannot actually be demonstrated in relation to the company which is the subject of the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I do not accept the applicants’ submissions. Dealing first with <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Stanford</span> (EWCA), the English Court of Appeal in that case recognised the Antiguan winding up of the company, Stanford International Bank, as a “foreign main proceeding” under the CBIR. Stanford International Bank had failed to comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Antiguan court held that it was just and equitable that the bank be liquidated and dissolved under the supervision of the Court pursuant to s 300 of the International Business Corporations Act (Cap 222) (Antigua and Barbuda). Crucially, that provision does not list insolvency as a ground for winding up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Nevertheless, the first instance judge held the Antiguan winding up order was “pursuant to a law relating to insolvency” as “an important part of the evidence was that [Stanford International Bank] was insolvent” (see <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford International Bank Ltd </span>[2009] EWHC 1441 (Ch) at [94]–[95]). This reasoning was substantially upheld by the English Court of Appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span> (EWCA) at [15]). On this view, the learned authors in <span class="font-italic">Goode on Insolvency Law</span> interpret the English Court of Appeal’s holding as accepting that a proceeding commenced on, amongst others, a finding of insolvency falls within the scope of the Model Law. This is even if the proceeding could have been opened on multiple grounds, only some of which relate to insolvency (at p 925). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor</span>, recognition proceedings were brought in England under the CBIR in respect of the “extraordinary administration” of the largest privately-owned company in Croatia. In considering whether the proceeding fell within the meaning of “foreign proceeding” under the CBIR, the court stated a preference for the approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the proceeding is brought “under a law relating to insolvency” if insolvency is one of the grounds on which the proceeding can be commenced, even if insolvency cannot actually be demonstrated in relation to the company which is the subject of those proceedings (at [63] and [73]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Be that as it may, this part of the judgment is, in my view, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and accordingly of little persuasive value. This is because the court was satisfied that the company was in a state of “serious financial distress” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>at [69]) and that the “extraordinary administration” proceeding could commence only on grounds either of insolvency or of impending insolvency, whether proved or deemed (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>at [68]). Accordingly, the court held that “[i]t is in fact the insolvency, actual or threatened, of one company which triggers the proceeding, and the law under which the proceeding is brought is accordingly in principle a law relating to insolvency for this purpose” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>at [73]). Contrary to the applicants’ submission, therefore, I do not think that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor</span> necessarily stands for the proposition that a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of the Model Law need not involve a company which is insolvent or in severe financial distress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Even if I am wrong in my interpretation of these decisions, it is nevertheless open to me to prefer <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> to these decisions. I am not bound in any way by any of these decisions. But I consider that my preference for <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> is well-justified. In particular, I bear in mind the 2013 Guide, which states that a proceeding under a law that prescribes the winding up of an entity on various grounds falls within the definition of “foreign proceeding” only if that provision is applied to a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress (at para 48):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48. … Where a proceeding serves several purposes, including the winding up of a solvent entity, it falls under article 2, subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(a)</span> of the Model Law only if the debtor is insolvent or in severe financial distress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This, in my view, refers clearly to a multi-factorial provision such as the winding up of a company on the just and equitable ground. Accordingly, the 2013 Guide makes clear that the winding up of a company under a provision of this nature ought not be recognised under the Model Law unless the company is insolvent or in severe financial distress. The interpretation which the applicants submit I should infer from <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(EWCA) and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor</span> therefore runs contrary to UNCITRAL’s intent in promulgating the Model Law. I decline to adopt that interpretation in interpreting the Third Schedule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The second string to the applicants’ bow lies in the argument that there is a need to treat the English cases with circumspection. This is because of the differences in the legislative background between the CBIR and the Third Schedule. In particular, the applicants argue that the English courts’ decisions are likely to be influenced, at least indirectly, by the Council of the European Union’s Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings, EC Council Regulation 1346/2000 (replaced by Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May on Insolvency Proceedings (recast), EU Parliament and Council Regulation 2015/848).

</div>
</div> This interpretative issue was recognised in <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet </span>where Abdullah J observed that the differences in legislative backgrounds may, on occasion, lead to different nuances in interpretation and application (at [34]–[35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I have no doubt that there is a need to be sensitive to the specific legislative background when considering any decision of a court in a foreign jurisdiction, especially given that Parliament chose not to enact the Model Law wholesale in the Third Schedule but chose instead to customise it for local conditions. And as the court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>makes clear (at [36]), the approach adopted by one jurisdiction in interpreting an international convention such as the Model Law need not be adopted slavishly by the courts of another jurisdiction, notwithstanding the injunction to judges in Art 8 of the Model Law. The key consideration is always the underlying legislative context of the specific legislation that the court has to interpret and apply (see [117] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In my judgment however, the applicants’ submission may be overstating this issue somewhat. As I have said, the court in <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> undertook a thorough review of the UNCITRAL reports and preparatory papers, the 1997 Guide, the 2013 Guide, the case law and commentaries relevant to the meaning of “foreign proceeding” under the CBIR (see [130] above). I therefore do not consider that endorsing the analysis <span class="font-italic">Re Sturgeon</span> runs the risk of adopting at an interpretation contrary to Parliament’s intention as a matter of Singapore law, despite the differing legislative background to the Third Schedule as compared to the CBIR.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Australian position should not be adopted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I deal very quickly with the position in Australian law. The applicants rely on the Supreme Court of New South Wales’s (“the NSW Supreme Court”) decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon (Private) Ltd</span> (2011) 80 NSWLR 507 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon</span>”) in support of their argument that the solvent liquidation of a company is a “foreign proceeding” within the scope of the Third Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In so far as this remains the position under Australian law, the criticisms that I have made in relation to <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(EWCA)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Agrokor </span>apply with equal force (see [132]–[142] and [149] above). In addition, I accept Mr Kumar’s submission that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon</span> was rendered without the benefit of the 2013 Guide and should be accorded less weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon</span> was a recognition application brought in the NSW Supreme Court under s 581(2)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act. That section obliges the Australian courts to “act in aid of” and to “be auxiliary to” a foreign proceeding. The foreign proceeding in question was the winding-up of a Singapore-incorporated company on the ground that it was just and equitable to do so. One of the main issues before the NSW Supreme Court was whether s 581(2)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act was inapplicable by virtue of s 22 of the Australian Cross-Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) (“the CBIA”). Section 22 of the CBIA provides that the provisions of Division 9 of Part 5.6 of the Australian Corporations Act, in which s 581(2)(a) is located, has no effect to the extent that these provisions of the Australian Corporations Act are inconsistent with the provisions of the CBIA. It was in this context that the NSW Supreme Court had to consider whether s 581(2)(a) of the Australian Corporations Act was consistent with Art 25 of the CBIA. Article 25 of the CBIA imposed an obligation of cooperation upon the Australian courts where assistance is sought by a “foreign representative” under Art 9 of the CBIA. The definition of “foreign representative” under Art 2 of the CBIA, in turn, required the court to be satisfied that the individual or body was authorised in a “foreign proceeding” to administer the reorganisation or liquidation of the debtor company’s assets or affairs. This was why the NSW Supreme Court had to consider the meaning of “foreign proceeding”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The NSW Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon</span> preferred the position in <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(EWCA)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>. Following those cases, the court concluded that the whole of the winding up provisions in the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) are to be classified as “a law relating to insolvency”. As a result, the court held that a Singapore winding up commenced under the Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed) is a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of the CBIA (at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For the reasons given above, I decline to follow <span class="font-italic">Re Stanford</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(EWCA)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>. Given that, I also decline to follow <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon</span>. Crucially, in considering whether the Singapore winding up was a proceeding “pursuant to a law relating to insolvency”, the NSW Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Re Chow Cho Poon </span>observed that the “instinctive answer … is ‘no’”, given that the reason for winding up the company was not due it its inability to pay its debts as they fell due, but simply because the Singapore court concluded that it was “just and equitable” for the company to be wound up (at [39] and [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Two other questions must be answered in the affirmative to justify the conclusion that the Singapore winding up is a “foreign proceeding”: first, is CCP properly regarded as the debtor; second, is the proceeding “pursuant to a law relating to insolvency”?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The instinctive answer to each question is “no”. The winding up is not a winding up in insolvency. It was not the inability of CCP, as a debtor, to pay its debts as they fell due that constituted the ground on which the Singapore court ordered that the company be wound up. Rather, the court concluded, for reasons that the evidence does not disclose, that it was “just and equitable” that the company be wound up</span>. It exercised jurisdiction under the [Companies Act (2006 Rev Ed)] to make a winding up order where the court was satisfied that it was “just and equitable” to do so. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the Singapore law “pursuant to” which the winding up is in place is properly characterised as “a law relating to insolvency”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 This observation is important, because it supports the view that the ordinary meaning of the words “law relating to insolvency” encompass only a proceeding invoked in circumstances where the company is insolvent or in severe financial distress. It is unlikely that the NSW Supreme Court would have arrived at the same conclusion if it had the benefit of the guidance set out in the 2013 Guide. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I therefore accept that the Australian position in respect of the interpretation of the term “foreign proceeding” under the CBIA should not be adopted in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 I turn now to consider whether Ascentra’s liquidation was commenced “under a law relating to insolvency” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ascentra’s liquidation is not a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 For the reasons I have set out above, I do not consider the fact that Ascentra’s liquidation was initiated under the Cayman Act means, in itself, that its liquidation has a “basis in a law relating to insolvency”. It is necessary for me to go beyond that and determine whether the specific provision under which Ascentra’s liquidation was commenced is one that applies to a company which is insolvent or in severe financial distress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As I have mentioned (see [11] above), Ascentra’s liquidation started as a voluntary winding up commenced pursuant to a shareholders’ resolution.

This petition was presented under s 124(1) of the Cayman Act:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for supervision order</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">124.</span> (1) Where a company is being wound up voluntarily its liquidator shall apply to the Court for an order that the liquidation continue under the supervision of the Court unless, within twenty-eight days of the commencement of the liquidation, the directors have signed a declaration of solvency in the prescribed form in accordance with subsection (2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Grand Court granted Mr Graham’s petition, thereby bringing Ascentra’s liquidation proceeding under the supervision of the Grand Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Having considered the set of provisions which govern Ascentra’s liquidation, I accept Mr Kumar’s submission that its liquidation does not fulfil the second requirement in <span class="font-italic">United Securities</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the  proceeding “must have its basis in a law relating to insolvency”. I am satisfied that the track under which Ascentra’s liquidation was commenced, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ss 116(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with 124 of the Cayman Act, does not and cannot apply to a company that is insolvent or in severe financial distress.

</div>
</div> that may be true in theory. But all of the evidence suggests that that is not likely to happen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 For all of these reasons, I do not consider that I have the power to make any order recognising Ascentra’s Cayman liquidation under Art 17. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 For the reasons above, I have dismissed the application.

That is as it should be. It was never intended that the Model Law or the Third Schedule should have that effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 It remains the case, however, that Singapore law recognises the Liquidators’ power to cause Ascentra to take steps in Singapore: see <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws</span> (Lord Collins of Mapesbury ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 8–091. These steps include those necessary to gather the evidence that the Liquidators need to frame causes of action, to identify defendants and to assess prospects of success in litigation. These steps even include commencing proceedings against SPGK Singapore, SPGK Cayman and Scuderia Bianco in Singapore. Indeed, the applicants accept that it remains open for the Liquidators to seek procedural remedies for and in the name of Ascentra such as a pre-action discovery or non-party discovery under O 11 r 11 of the Rules of Court 2021.
