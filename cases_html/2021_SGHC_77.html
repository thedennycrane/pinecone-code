The multiplier, in turn, is the mathematical tool used to calculate the lump-sum present value of the stream of future periodic losses across the remaining life expectancy and the remaining working life … of the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Determining the multiplicand, while fraught with difficulty, is ultimately no more or less difficult than the court’s usual task in making findings of contested present or projected fact. Determining the multiplier, on the other hand, poses all of those difficulties plus additional difficulties of concept and of principle. Those additional difficulties lead to differences of approach which have the potential to have a significant effect on the quantum of damages awarded. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Determining the multiplier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The multiplier represents the number of periods which comprise the total duration of a particular head of loss. For loss of future earnings, the duration of a plaintiff’s loss will be the remainder of his working life. For future medical treatment, the duration of a plaintiff’s loss will be the period for which he is likely to require that treatment. In the case of lifelong medical treatment, the duration of the plaintiff’s loss will be the rest of his natural life.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 To avoid the risk of overcompensating a plaintiff, the multiplier must be adjusted to account for two features. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 One adjustment to the multiplier is to account for the time value of money, or for accelerated receipt as it is traditionally known. A lump sum of money in a plaintiff’s hands today has traditionally thought to be worth more to a plaintiff than a stream of periodic payments equivalent in quantum to the multiplicand over the duration of the plaintiff’s loss. This is because a plaintiff can invest the lump sum in order to earn a real, positive rate of return, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a rate of return which is above the inflation rate. That return must be treated as part of the plaintiff’s compensation and must therefore be brought into account. That is done by adjusting the multiplier to account for the anticipated rate of achievable return. That anticipated rate of achievable return is the discount rate. The conventional range for discount rates in damages awards in Singapore is 4% to 5% (see <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span> at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The other adjustment to the multiplier is to account for what is called the vicissitudes of life. The vicissitudes of life are factors which could shorten the duration of the plaintiff’s loss and therefore reduce the plaintiff’s loss as compared to the loss anticipated at the time of assessment. The primary factor which could have this result, of course, is the possibility that the plaintiff may die of causes unrelated to the tort before the expiry of the duration of his loss anticipated at the date of assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek </span>noted that there are four approaches to determining the multiplier (at [50]). Each approach deals with the two adjustments to the multiplier in different ways. The precedent approach determines the multiplier by analogy with past precedents. The arithmetic approach determines the multiplier by the arithmetic formula for determining the net present value of a stream of payments into the future. The actuarial approach determines the multiplier by reference to actuarial tables. The fixed-formula approach determines the multiplier by a formula fixed by legislation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In the absence of authoritative actuarial tables for Singapore lives, and in the absence of any formula fixed by legislation, the precedent approach and the arithmetic approach are to be preferred in Singapore. These two approaches are to be used independently, with the precedent approach used to cross-check the result obtained by the arithmetic approach so as to ensure consistency with past awards in like cases (<span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek </span>at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The precedent approach embeds the adjustment for both accelerated receipt and the vicissitudes of life in the multipliers which the courts have selected in past cases, albeit in a manner which has been until recently, unreasoned, unarticulated, and ultimately unprincipled. The arithmetic approach uses a formula which is a function of the discount rate for any given loss and duration to calculate a multiplier. The multiplier calculated by this formula adjusts only for the time value of money at the selected discount rate. A multiplier derived by the arithmetic approach must therefore be adjusted further to account for the vicissitudes of life (see <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span> at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Authoritative actuarial tables set out multipliers which incorporate an evidence-based adjustment for life expectancy at a range of discount rates. One of the advantages of the actuarial approach is therefore that it allows a multiplier which is adjusted both for the time value of money and for the vicissitudes of life to be selected from a single source. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Loss of future earnings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff cannot return to gainful employment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The plaintiff advances his case for loss of future earnings on the basis that he will not be able to return to gainful employment for the remainder of his working life.

The Singapore Tables, to my knowledge, have not attained the status of authoritativeness (to quote the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span> at [51] and [80]). Further, as the parties have pointed out, the Singapore Tables are based on life expectancy data which is not up to date.

The minimum statutory age of retirement, both at the time of the plaintiff’s accident and at the date of the assessment, is 62 years of age as stipulated by s 4 of the Retirement and Re-Employment Act (Cap 274A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“RRA”).

Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Retirement and Re-Employment (Exemption) Notification 2011 provide that neither the statutory minimum retirement age of 62 nor the statutory obligation to offer re-employment applies to individuals who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents. In the circumstances, I cannot rely on the RRA alone to find that the plaintiff would have retired at 67 or at some later age. Without further evidence and submissions on this specific point, I am inclined to accept Mr Evans’ evidence that the plaintiff would retire at 65, despite the defendant’s willingness to accept in principle a retirement age of 70.

</div> It follows that the number of periods of the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings would be 21 (being 65–44).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, the plaintiff also has a claim for post-retirement income. The plaintiff’s pre-retirement and post-retirement income must be calculated separately. This is because the plaintiff accepts that his post-retirement income (if any) would have been markedly lower than his pre-retirement income.

</div> For the avoidance of doubt, therefore, the calculation of the multiplier and the multiplicand in the following sections take into account only the plaintiff’s pre-retirement income.

</div>
</div> Presumably, the plaintiff accepts that selecting a discount rate of 1% is too radical to be considered an incremental departure from the conventional range.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I do not think that is necessarily the case. It is true that in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span>, the Court of Appeal held that any departure from the conventional range “should be undertaken only incrementally and by reference to or analogy with past cases” (at [65]). But the Court of Appeal in the same case also found merit in the tiered discount rate framework proposed by Bharwaney J in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting v Chan Chi Kuen (No 2)</span> [2013] 2 HKLRD 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting</span>”) (<span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek </span>at [64] and [67]). That tiered framework contemplates a discount rate as low as -0.5% (<span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek </span>at [64]). A discount rate of -0.5% is a far more radical departure from the conventional range than a discount rate of 1% in two senses. Arithmetically, it is of course a bigger jump downwards. And conceptually, a negative discount rate is a more radical departure from the conventional range than any positive discount rate. A negative discount rate assumes that inflation will exceed nominal rates of return over the period of the plaintiff’s loss and amounts to applying a premium for accelerated receipt, rather than the orthodox discount. As the Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span> (at [67]), the fundamental difficulty in that case was not so much the magnitude of the departure from the conventional range but that there was simply no expert evidence or submissions on macroeconomic trends in Singapore and the impact on likely investment returns to warrant such a departure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The question for me, therefore, is not whether the departure which the plaintiff proposes is a radical or an incremental departure from the conventional discount rate. The more pertinent question for me is whether the plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to establish that a departure from the conventional range is warranted in the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff relies on the Public Documents as the necessary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Public Documents comprise the following:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 <span class="font-italic"> </span>In my view, a court cannot take judicial notice of a fact simply because it is an economic and financial fact evidenced by a public document. Lai J took judicial notice of the appreciation of the Thai baht in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel </span>not because it was an economic and financial fact evidenced by public documents but because the currency appreciation “may be easily and accurately established by reference to a readily-available variety of unimpeachable sources” (<span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu</span><span class="font-italic"> Shan </span>at [33]). I note that there may be some overlap between Categories 1 and 2 in relation to the use of unimpeachable or authoritative sources. However, such an overlap is understandable given the idea of <span class="font-italic">incontrovertibility</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that underpins the doctrine of judicial notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On Category 2, there is to my knowledge no settled judicial definition of what amounts to an “authoritative” source. Having said that, <span class="font-italic">Hauque Enamul v China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] 5 SLR 485 (“<span class="font-italic">Hauque</span>”) offers some guidance. In <span class="font-italic">Hauque,</span> George Wei J took judicial notice of the fact that Singapore public hospitals have begun implementing an electronic record exchange system. Wei J accepted that this fact can be found on the Ministry of Health’s webpage, and accepted further that that was an authoritative source (<span class="font-italic">Hauque </span>at [93]). In my view, an official publication by an arm of the government which asserts a fact within the purview of that arm of government is an authoritative source. That does not, however, mean that no other sources can be authoritative sources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Applying these principles, the seven facts listed at [45] above are not within Category 1. These seven facts are highly specific and technical financial and economic information. They are not so widely known or clearly established as to be “accepted by the public without qualification or contention” (see <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan</span> at [27]). None of these facts are “notorious” in any sense of the word. They are all outside Category 1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The key question, therefore, is whether any of these facts are within Category 2. That in turn depends on whether they are facts which can be immediately and accurately shown to exist by “authoritative sources”. In considering this question, I bear in mind the Court of Appeal’s warning in <span class="font-italic">Zheng Yu Shan</span> that a judge should exercise judicious caution in taking judicial notice of facts (at [29]–[30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 My assessment of whether the seven facts listed at [45] are within Category 2 is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The historical yield of 10-year SGS and foreign bonds (at [45(a)] and [45(f)]) is outside Category 2. The Public Documents refer to a website known as <span class="font-italic">Trading Ec</span><span class="font-italic">onomics</span>. There is no evidence as to where <span class="font-italic">Trading Economics </span>obtained the yield data from. I must therefore treat <span class="font-italic">Trading Economics </span>as the source of the historical yield data. I do not accept <span class="font-italic">Trading Economics</span> to be an authoritative source.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The discount rate prescribed by statute in England and Wales (at [45(d)]) is within Category 2. The source of this fact is the Lord Chancellor’s Department. The Lord Chancellor is empowered by the Damages Act of England and Wales to set the relevant discount rate. I accept the Lord Chancellor’s Department to be an authoritative source for this fact.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The historical interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve (at [45(e)]) is outside Category 2. The historical rates appear in a document from the <span class="font-italic">Trading Economics</span> website. The ultimate source for these rates is said to be the US Federal Reserve itself. But that statement is self-serving and is not authoritative, coming as it does from a source (<span class="font-italic">Trading Economics</span>) which I do not accept as authoritative. These historical interest rates would have been within Category 2 if the document produced to me was an official publication of the Federal Reserve itself. In that event, the facts would originate from an arm of the US Federal government and assert facts within that arm’s purview. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The average yield of 10-year SGS bonds, obtained as at May 2020 (at [45(b)]) is within Category 2. The source is the MAS. I accept that these facts have been shown to exist by an official publication of an arm of the government asserting a fact within that arm’s purview. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The short-term interest rates for the European Union, defined <span class="font-italic">generally</span>, (at [45(g)]) are outside Category 2. Short-term interest rates vary based on the time horizon and the index being used. Therefore, I do not find that there can be an authoritative source on short-term interest rates in the European Union <span class="font-italic">in general</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The historical returns on the SPDR and Nikko AM STI ETFs (at [45(c)]) are outside Category 2. The figures are obtained from Yahoo! Finance. I do not accept Yahoo! Finance as an authoritative source.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 My analysis so far only touches on whether the seven facts listed at [45] above are within Category 2. Even when a fact is within Category 1 or Category 2, the court retains a discretion to take judicial notice of the fact. As I pointed out to plaintiff’s counsel in the course of oral submissions, the plaintiff has adopted a very expansive reading of s 59, a reading which may carry many unintended consequences.

</div> The defendant’s argument presupposes that the plaintiff’s analysis amounts to a fact which must be proved. I disagree. The plaintiff’s analysis, properly construed, is a <span class="font-italic">submission</span>. The submission attempts to draw out the nexus between the factual premises, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the facts in the Public Documents which the plaintiff wants me to take judicial notice of, and a legal conclusion, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it is appropriate to select a discount rate of 2.5% even though it is outside the conventional range.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, this mischaracterisation of the nature of the plaintiff’s analysis does not detract from the substance of the defendant’s argument. There are two prongs to the argument.

</div> First, the selection of a discount rate requires far more financial and economic facts than those asserted in the Public Documents. Second, the financial and economic data must be properly analysed by financial and economic experts, instead of by lawyers and the court. To put it bluntly, counsel and the court should focus on law and not economics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I agree with the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, I do not consider the facts asserted in the Public Documents are a sufficient evidential basis to select a discount rate of 2.5%. The discount rate is the achievable real rate of return that a plaintiff is likely to be able to earn on his award over the period of his loss. Selecting a discount rate thus requires some knowledge of the basket of investments that a plaintiff will reasonably invest the lump sum award in. The Public Documents refer to the historical returns of only <span class="font-italic">low-risk</span> investments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, deposits, ETFs and fixed-income instruments). The plaintiff therefore assumes that his basket of investments will comprise only <span class="font-italic">low-risk </span>investments. I do not find this assumption justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The plaintiff’s explanation for this assumption is that he cannot afford to make risky investments because he will have to live off the award for the rest of his life and therefore has no room for error.

</div> That is the case for every plaintiff who has suffered personal injuries by reason of a tort. A similar explanation was rejected by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lai Wai Keong Eugene v Loo Wei Yen </span>[2014] 3 SLR 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span>”). According to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span>, a plaintiff does not require the entire sum of the award to meet his expenses at any one point in time, and thus a substantial portion of the award, which would not be called upon for many years, can be invested in relatively higher-risk (and therefore higher-reward) investments (<span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Moreover, even assuming that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to confine his basket of investments to low-risk investments, there is no reason to consider it reasonable to limit his investments to the <span class="font-italic">specific</span><span class="font-italic"> low-risk investments mentioned in the Public Documents</span>. Risk and reward are undoubtedly correlated. But, as the defendant points out, there exist a whole range of low-risk investments – including but not limited to real estate, real estate investment trusts, index funds and preferred stock – which enable an investor to achieve higher returns without disproportionately higher risk.

</div> I do not accept this submission. It is well beyond the ability of any court to interpret and analyse financial and economic data of this nature, assuming it to be sufficient for the purpose, without the assistance of experts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Eugene Lai</span>, the discount rate represents “the average [effective] rate of return <span class="font-italic">over a plaintiff’s remaining working lifespan</span>” [emphasis added] (at [36]). In other words, selecting the discount rate requires an estimate of the likely average rates of return <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic">to the future.</span> The average rates of return at the date of assessment are only one factor in this exercise. It is one thing to estimate the <span class="font-italic">current </span>average<span class="font-italic"> </span>rate of return based on <span class="font-italic">current </span>economic data. It is another thing altogether to estimate <span class="font-italic">future </span>average<span class="font-italic"> </span>rates of return based on <span class="font-italic">current </span>economic data. To do so requires expert knowledge and analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Further, in this case, the duration of the plaintiff’s loss stretches two decades into the future. A lay person cannot forecast whether average rates of return will continue to remain low for such a long duration. A lay person can only guess. An expert can at least make an educated, informed and principled guess. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  Additionally, selecting a discount rate requires some account to be taken of inflation. This is because the real rate of return on any investment is the nominal rate of return less the inflation rate. The plaintiff has adduced no evidence on the outlook for inflation.

</div> I do not accept this assertion. If one is to descend to the level of granularity which the plaintiff advocates in selecting the discount rate, one ought equally to descend to the same level of granularity in estimating inflation. The plaintiff’s submission that his failure to account explicitly for inflation is beneficial to the defendant assumes that inflation will continue to be positive throughout the plaintiff’s period of loss. But deflationary periods in the next 20 years or so are not beyond the realm of possibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In summary, I find that there is neither sufficient financial or economic data nor sufficient expert analysis of that data to justify selecting a discount rate beyond the lower end of the conventional range (at either 1% or 2.5%). A contrast can be drawn with the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Pak Ting</span>, the court had the following financial and economic data available:

And the analysis of this data was undertaken by experts rather than being the subject of submission. In particular, the expert used the economic data to (a) set out different baskets of investments at different levels of risk for plaintiffs of different levels of need and (b) projected rates of return into the future. This level of factual and expert evidence is missing in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 A further contrast can be drawn with the discount rate prescribed by statute in England and Wales. This statutory discount rate was selected only after careful study and consultation. Detailed and exhaustive financial and economic data was collated from the responses to the government’s surveys on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the investment habits and risk appetites of claimants who receive lump sum damages in serious personal injury cases. This data was also thoroughly analysed by the Government Actuary, who presented his analysis and recommendation to the Lord Chancellor for approval. The Lord Chancellor did not select the statutory discount rate in England and Wales on incomplete data. The Lord Chancellor selected the discount rate only with the assistance of experts who obtained and analysed extensive financial and economic data.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In conclusion, I recognise that economic circumstances and life expectancies have changed fundamentally since the precedent approach arrived at multipliers which carry discount rates in the conventional range of 4% to 5%. The Court of Appeal recognised this in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span>. But, as the Court of Appeal also held, the court must have sufficient and cogent evidence together with expert interpretation and analysis before it can conclude that a discount rate outside the conventional range is warranted.

First, the plaintiff’s employment in the banking industry is particularly susceptible to the vagaries of the economy.

</div> Second, the plaintiff’s penchant for thrill-seeking means that his career could have been cut short by accident even if the defendant had not injured him.

</div> But the defendant makes no attempt to apply this general trend to the specific circumstances of the plaintiff and his employment. I do not accept that this general trend justifies selecting a discount rate at the top end of the conventional range, given that the plaintiff had attained a relatively senior position in the industry before his accident. In my view, the general vagaries of the economy or even the specific vagaries of the private banking industry are therefore less likely to affect the plaintiff’s earnings. Further, there is no guarantee that any decline in the performance or prospects for the private banking industry, or for BJB in particular, which is currently apparent will continue for the duration of the plaintiff’s loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendant’s second reason for selecting a discount rate of 5% is, in my view, pure speculation. Of course, thrill-seeking does pose a risk of injury or death by accident. But even the most avid thrill seekers take precautions for their own self-preservation. There is nothing to suggest that the plaintiff would not do the same. Further, the defendant offers no way by which to assess the plaintiff’s net risk, qualitatively or quantitatively. The submission is therefore of no quantitative assistance in selecting a discount rate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I consider the risk of the plaintiff’s injury or death by accident from thrill-seeking to be so remote as to be negligible in selecting the discount rate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The discount rate</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In summary, I find that there is insufficient basis to select a discount rate below the lower limit of the conventional range, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 4%. But I find also that there is insufficient basis to select a discount rate at the upper limit of this range, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having considered the two facts which I have found that I can take judicial notice of (at [52(b)] and [52(d)] above), I accept that we are now in a low interest rate environment and that it is likely to persist for an appreciable part of the duration of the plaintiff’s loss. This indicates to me that I should select a discount rate in the lower half of the conventional range. Having said that, the plaintiff’s period of loss stretches over two decades. That length of time means that his investment horizon is further away and that the degree of risk which it is reasonable to expect him to take is higher. Further, I cannot assume that the current low interest rate environment will persist for the entire duration of his loss. I therefore consider that I should not select a discount rate too far<span class="font-italic"> </span>down into the lower half of the conventional range. Given the absence of assistance from expert evidence, the task falls to me to select a discount rate which is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. Considering all the evidence presented to me and all the circumstances of the case, I select a discount rate of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">4.2</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">5%</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The calculations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I now calculate the multiplier for the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings. The multiplier is the number which, when multiplied by the multiplicand, will yield the present value of an ordinary annuity which will pay out to the plaintiff a constant sum equivalent to the multiplicand over the 21-year duration of his loss, after accounting for the returns earned over that duration at the discount rate. An annuity is a series of constant payments at constant intervals for a fixed duration into the future. An ordinary annuity is an annuity in which each constant payment is made at the end of an intervals rather than at the beginning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The mathematical formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is as follows: <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, 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"/>.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I accept that this approach applies to loss of future income as well as to future medical expenses. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang</span> spoke of difficulties with ascertaining future losses <span class="font-italic">generally</span>, and not just about ascertaining future medical expenses. In the same vein, loss of future earnings and future medical expenses are both in the nature of <span class="font-italic">future loss</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>To this extent, I can think of no principled distinctions between the two heads of loss. Further, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek </span>also took the position that no such distinction can be drawn. In [45] of <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Quek</span>, the Court commented that the determination of a multiplier for <span class="font-italic">both </span>future medical expenses and loss of future earning is difficult because such a determination “involves a double exercise in the art of prophesying not only what the future holds for the injured plaintiff but also what the future would have held for him if he had not been injured”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 However, a critical distinction must be drawn between future events that are <span class="font-italic">within </span>a plaintiff’s control, and those which are <span class="font-italic">not within </span>a plaintiff’s control. For instance, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lua Bee Kiang </span>was speaking of the possible future onset of a medical condition, which is a future event not<span class="font-italic"> </span>within a plaintiff’s control. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Therefore, insofar as there is a lower standard of proof in claims for loss of future earnings, I find that that lower standard applies only to events which are <span class="font-italic">beyond </span>the plaintiff’s control. I demonstrate this point by way of an example. Assume that the plaintiff claimed that he had received and was considering an irrevocable offer of employment in November 2014, before the accident, from a rival private bank. Assume further that the rival bank’s offer carried a salary which was double the plaintiff’s salary at BJB. If the plaintiff wished to use that higher salary as his multiplicand, he would have to prove on the usual balance of probabilities that he would have accepted the offer. This is because accepting an irrevocable offer would be entirely within his control. In contrast, whether BJB would promote the plaintiff is not something within his control. No matter how well he performed, whether he would ultimately be promoted would depend on the assessment of his superiors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As earlier mentioned, the three key variables in relation to the multiplicand are (a) the plaintiff’s prospects of promotion(s); (b) his annual salary increments and (c) his annual bonuses. I thus use the three variables as a conceptual framework to organise my analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s promotion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I begin with the plaintiff’s prospects of promotion. There are two levels of promotions that the plaintiff could have enjoyed but for his accident: from ED to MDSA, and from MDSA to MD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Having considered the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has discharged the burden of showing that he had an appreciable chance of being promoted to MDSA but for the accident. Luigi Vignola (“Mr Vignola”) was the plaintiff’s direct superior at BJB at the time of the accident. Mr Vignola’s evidence was that, but for his accident, the plaintiff would have achieved rapid career progression within BJB and would today be one of its leading executives:

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As stated above, Mr Vignola testified that the plaintiff had the “clear potential” to attain MD rank. A promotion to MDSA must precede promotion to MD. It follows that Mr Vignola must have <span class="font-italic">at least</span> considered the plaintiff to have the same “clear potential” to attain MDSA rank. However, the reality is that a promotion from ED to MDSA is much more frequent, and therefore likely, than a promotion from MDSA to MD. Implicit in Mr Vignola’s evidence is that it was even more likely for the plaintiff to be promoted from ED to MDSA than his “clear potential” for a promotion from MDSA to MD. Mr Vignola’s evidence is important because he, as the plaintiff’s direct supervisor, would have been the person chiefly responsible for championing and awarding the plaintiff’s promotion from ED to MDSA. The defendant’s expert himself recognised this.

</div> The defendant’s interpretation of Mr Vignola’s evidence is somewhat strained. Mr Vignola explained the concept of “leading executive” to mean a MD. Further, it would be unrealistic to expect Mr Vignola to assign a numerical probability to the plaintiff’s prospects of a promotion. Even the parties’ experts were unable to do that. What carries great weight with me is the overall tenor of Mr Vignola’s assessment of the plaintiff. Having considered Mr Vignola’s evidence, both in chief and under cross-examination, I am satisfied that Mr Vignola considered the plaintiff to have at the very least an <span class="font-italic">appreciable </span><span class="font-italic">chance</span> of being promoted to MDSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The defendant also submits that Mr Vignola’s assessment is not of much weight because Mr Vignola did not have much of a basis in the plaintiff’s performance and track record at BJB on which to make an assessment.

</div> That may be the case, but the standard of proof, as the defendants concede, is simply an <span class="font-italic">appreciable chance</span>. Mr Vignola’s evidence is in my view more than sufficient for the plaintiff to satisfy this standard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendant submits that Mr Vignola was replaced in 2017 by one Rajesh Manwani (“Mr Manwani”). Since no evidence from Mr Manwani was adduced, it could not be said that Mr Manwani shared Mr Vignola’s high estimation of the plaintiff’s capabilities and current estimated potential.

</div> I do not find this argument convincing. Mr Manwani did not give evidence because he did not work with the plaintiff. He therefore had no basis on which to assess the plaintiff’s capabilities or to give evidence as to the plaintiff’s prospects of promotion. Therefore, the fact that the plaintiff did not call Mr Manwani cannot be held against the plaintiff. Further, I am satisfied that Mr Vignola’s assessment of the plaintiff’s capabilities and current estimated potential is not a partial or idiosyncratic assessment but is an impartial and rational assessment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Second, there was evidence at trial that the plaintiff’s post-accident replacement in BJB, Sacha Walker (“Mr Walker”), is currently of MDSA rank.

</div> The plaintiff relies on this as evidence that the plaintiff too would have been promoted to MDSA rank. The defendant argues that this evidence is of little to no weight, since there is no evidence that Mr Walker was promoted to MDSA rank after coming to work at BJB Singapore.

</div> This argument is too general and too speculative to be taken into consideration. The plaintiff’s promotional prospects must be assessed over 21 years into the future. There is no basis to assume that the economic uncertainty would have continued throughout this long period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I therefore accept that the plaintiff has discharged the burden of proving that he would have been promoted to MDSA rank. Having said that, I do not accept that the plaintiff has discharged the burden of showing that he would have been promoted to MD rank. I say that for several reasons. First and foremost, as a matter of statistical inference, Mr Vignola gave evidence that in the two departments then under his purview, which had about a hundred staff, there were ten MDSAs but only <span class="font-italic">one </span>MD, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Vignola himself.

</div> A promotion from MDSA to MD is considerably less likely than a promotion from ED to MDSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The plaintiff seeks to downplay this statistical inference by referring, once again, to Mr Vignola’s favourable testimony. According to the plaintiff, it should be enough that Mr Vignola testified that the plaintiff had “clear potential” to be promoted to MD (see [93] above). I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission. There is a key difference between a promotion from ED to MDSA and a promotion from MDSA to MD. The latter promotion could only have come about if the plaintiff were to take over Mr Vignola’s position.

</div> In the former situation, the plaintiff’s promotion would not have affected Mr Vignola in any way. This distinction, to my mind, reduces the weight of Mr Vignola’s testimony in relation to the plaintiff’s prospects of promotion to MD rank. Of course, this distinction applies only if the plaintiff remained in the same department in BJB as he was before the accident. But if the plaintiff was to change department, Mr Vignola’s testimony would once again be of less weight as to the plaintiff’s prospects in that new department.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Second, there is no objective evidence that the plaintiff was on track to be promoted to MD as there was for a promotion to MDSA. The plaintiff cannot be faulted for this. His possible promotion to MD was far in the future and subject to many contingencies at the time of the accident. But the burden of proof nevertheless rests on the plaintiff. And in the absence of any other evidence, I cannot find based on Mr Vignola’s oral evidence of “clear potential” that there was an appreciable chance that the plaintiff would have been promoted to MD. For completeness, I do not give much weight to the plaintiff’s track record of past achievements or his ongoing projects at the time of the accident. As the defendant has rightly pointed out, most if not all candidates vying for a MD position would have the same track record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Having established that the plaintiff had an appreciable chance of being promoted to MDSA rank but not beyond, I now must establish what his income would likely be. The plaintiff argues that as the plaintiff would become more senior and would draw a higher salary, I should not select a single multiplicand.

</div> However, as I have found that the plaintiff would have been promoted only to MDSA, there is in my view no contraindication to using a single multiplicand for the entire period of the plaintiff’s loss. Insofar as the plaintiff’s salary would continue to increase because of the ordinary annual salary increments, without a change in rank, these increases do not necessitate the use of different multiplicands, since these increases would not be as radical as a step-change increases occasioned by promotion to a new rank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I note that Mr Evans and Mr Tan’s initial positions on the plaintiff’s base salary upon promotion to MDSA are similar.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Mr Evans’ hesitance to commit to a figure for annual salary increments may be understandable given the uncertainties involved. But uncertainty is not in itself a basis to justify a failure to give a figure or a range. Further, he also gave no evidence on the methodology or the basis on which he arrived at the range of base salaries in the preceding paragraph. In the circumstances, the weight which I can give to Mr Evans’ estimate is limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I now turn to the defendant’s approach. The defendant’s expert, Mr Tan, adopted a different methodology from Mr Evans. He began by calculating the plaintiff’s actual salary increment between 2014 and 2015, which he worked out to be 1.67%.

</div> However, he noted that this increment may have been awarded on the basis only of the plaintiff’s work in January 2014 up to the accident in November 2014. He thus uplifted the increment to arrive at an annual salary increment of 2% if the plaintiff’s working year in 2014 had not been cut short by the accident.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I prefer Mr Tan’s methodology for three reasons. First, his estimate of the annual increment was based on actual calculations of the plaintiff’s salary change between 2014 and 2015. The plaintiff pointed out that this change in salary occurred <span class="font-italic">after </span>the accident took place, and therefore it cannot be readily assumed that this change is reflective of the increment that the plaintiff would have been awarded but for the accident.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This complaint, while intuitively appealing, was not supported by evidence. More importantly, Mr Tan himself recognised that the increment awarded in 2015 may have taken into account only the plaintiff’s work up to the accident. He has thus included an appropriate uplift. He also gave a further uplift to arrive at an annual figure of 2.5%. This further uplift in my view satisfactorily addresses the plaintiff’s complaint. Second, Mr Tan provided some corroborative evidence to show his estimate of the increment was consistent with the figures from the market.

</div>
</div> Third, Mr Evans made his estimates on the assumption that the plaintiff would have been promoted to MD in 2022, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Evans did not factor annual salary increments from 2023 onwards into his estimate of the plaintiff’s base salary <span class="font-italic">as MDSA</span>. As a corollary, adopting Mr Tan’s estimation would be less prejudicial to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I am inclined to assume that the plaintiff’s annual increments would be at <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">2.5%</span>, bearing in mind the plaintiff’s complaint in the preceding paragraph. Since the plaintiff’s base salary is now assumed to be increasing at a steady 2.5% per annum, the average base salary that the plaintiff would earn over the 21 years remaining of his career at the time of the accident (see [37] above) can be approximated as his base salary at the halfway point of that 21-year period. The plaintiff’s average base salary can therefore be approximated to be $450,000 x (1.025)^(21/2) = $583,194.07. For ease of calculation, I round this figure to the nearest $10,000 to achieve a value of $580,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 There is one further matter. This analysis presumes that the plaintiff would have remained in BJB’s employment for the remainder of his career. Mr Evans in his expert report did provide an alternative scenario where the plaintiff joined another private bank in Singapore. That scenario would have entailed a further uplift of 17.5% to the plaintiff’s base salary.

</div> I am prepared to accept that there was an appreciable chance that the plaintiff would have joined another private bank, since he was only 38 years old at the time of the accident. Most employees of that age will have at least one change of employment in the course of their career. However, I do not accept that the jump would have entailed a 17.5% uplift to the plaintiff’s base salary. Mr Evans adduced no objective evidence to support his estimation. I therefore assume that, even if the plaintiff had changed employer, it would not have made a material difference overall to his lifetime earnings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s yearly bonuses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The plaintiff’s annual remuneration also had a bonus component. I start with Mr Tan’s evidence. Mr Tan’s range is premised on his calculations of the plaintiff’s bonus in 2015 and some corroborating evidence from the market. Mr Tan begins his analysis with the plaintiff’s bonus in 2015, which was 14.7% of his base salary.

</div> An annual bonus is generally a reward to an employee for his performance over the past year. Since the plaintiff was on leave for most of 2015, it is very likely that his bonus for 2015 was not indicative of the bonus he would have been awarded but for the accident. This is the same conceptual point that the plaintiff made about Mr Tan’s estimate of the plaintiff’s annual increments. However, the criticism in the context of bonuses is much weightier, because there was evidence to show that the plaintiff could have earned a much higher bonus than he actually received for 2015. First, Mr Vignola states in his affidavit of evidence in chief that the plaintiff could generally have expected bonuses of between 6 and 9 months of base salary in good years.

</div> In percentage terms, this is an annual bonus of 50% to 75% of his base salary. In cross-examination, Mr Vignola recognised that the bonus actually awarded would of course vary with the circumstances, both individual and general. But I accept that the range of six to nine months is the general starting position in the plaintiff’s industry generally and at BJB specifically. Second, Mr Vignola gave evidence in cross-examination that Mr Walker was awarded a bonus of roughly 12 months of base salary as an MDSA.

</div> For these reasons, I do not attach great weight to Mr Tan’s range of 0% to 16%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I turn to Mr Evans’ estimate. He estimated that the plaintiff’s bonuses as an MDSA would range between 50% and 75%. Mr Evans’ estimation is consistent with Mr Vignola’s evidence that in a good year, the plaintiff could have been awarded six to nine months’ bonus. Mr Evans’ estimate is also supported by Mr Vignola’s evidence on the bonus actually awarded to Mr Walker. But Mr Evans’ evidence goes further in that he concludes that the plaintiff’s expected bonuses would be between 50% and 75% of base salary <span class="font-italic">every</span> year, as opposed to in the <span class="font-italic">good</span> years. Once again, Mr Evans fails to present the methodology behind this estimate or the evidence supporting it. I appreciate that bonuses to senior bankers are closely guarded confidential information with strategic value to industry players. But at the same time, I find it difficult to accept at face value what are essentially broad and bare assertions by Mr Evans. I prefer Mr Evans’ evidence to Mr Tan’s, but I give Mr Evans’ evidence only slightly more weight than Mr Tan’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Having considered the experts’ evidence, I take as my starting point Mr Evans’ range for the plaintiff’s annual bonuses at 50% to 75%. However, that is not the end of the matter. For two reasons, the actual cash and guaranteed component of the plaintiff’s bonus will be significantly lower than the 50% to 75% range.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 First of all, Mr Vignola’s evidence is that the 50% to 75% range is for a <span class="font-italic">good year</span>, not for every year. I have no basis on which to find that every year of the plaintiff’s remaining career would have been a good year, whether for his employer generally or for him personally.<span class="font-italic"> </span>I therefore cannot assume that the plaintiff would have been awarded bonuses of between 50% and 75% of his base salary for every remaining year of the plaintiff’s career. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Second, the defendant points out that part of the plaintiff’s bonus would take the form of shares and another part would be deferred.

</div> As mentioned above at [38], I have decided to calculate the plaintiff’s post-retirement earnings separately from his pre-retirement earnings, because his annual income post-retirement (if any) would be much lower than his annual income pre-retirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The plaintiff relies on Mr Evans’ report, which states that it is very likely for a person of the plaintiff’s qualifications and experience to continue participating in economic activity post-retirement. Mr Evans also estimates that the plaintiff was likely to have earned anywhere between $125,000 and $250,000 per annum gross post-retirement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In my view, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to have testified that he intended to continue working post-retirement for me to find that there is an appreciable chance that he would do so. First, the plaintiff was only 38 at the time of the accident and 44 at the time of the assessment. He is simply too young to have given any serious thought to working post-retirement. Second, it is not clear what kind of evidence would suffice to establish his intention to continue working post-retirement. Perhaps the defendant has in mind a statement in the plaintiff’s affidavit that he intended to continue working post-retirement. A bare statement to that effect is neither meaningful nor necessary. Any evidence he would give about his intentions in more than 20 years’ time would be of little or no evidential weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The prospect of the plaintiff continuing to work post-retirement thus depends on the strength and cogency of Mr Evans’ expert evidence. While I have expressed my criticism of Mr Evans’ expert evidence on certain points, these criticisms generally arise in relations to Mr Evans’ lack of methodology in the <span class="font-italic">quantification</span> of the figures which he presented to this court. However, this criticism carries less weight in relation to the assessment of what is essentially a <span class="font-italic">qualitative</span> assessment of the post-retirement aspirations of a person in the plaintiff’s position. Methodological clarity is, in my view, less important for such a qualitative assessment. What is more important is the expert’s credentials and experience in the field. On this part, there is little fault that can be found with Mr Evans’ evidence.

</div> Further, there is no denying the fact that but for the accident, the plaintiff would have amassed a wealth of experience by his retirement as (at the minimum) a MDSA, which is a relatively senior position. I therefore find that there is an appreciable chance that the plaintiff would have continued working post-retirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 However, when it comes to the <span class="font-italic">quantification</span> of the plaintiff’s post-retirement income, Mr Evans’ evidence once again falls short. This quantification exercise naturally places a greater premium on methodological clarity, and there was none from Mr Evans. It is understandable that a precise quantification of the plaintiff’s post-retirement income is impossible, but Mr Evans could have at least explained the methodology underlying his conclusions. In addition, Mr Evans did not state how long a person in the plaintiff’s position would be likely to continue working post-retirement. The plaintiff was content to assert, without any evidence or justification, that he would work until 70 years old. I do not find this bare assertion to be sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In the circumstances, I consider it more appropriate to make a lump-sum award for the plaintiff’s lost post-retirement earnings. I am once again constrained by the evidence, but this evidential uncertainty must be overcome to award just compensation to a tort victim. Viewing the evidence in the round, I am of the view that a lump-sum award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">100,000 </span>is appropriate.

In the case of future medical expenses, however, the Singapore Tables must be approached with particular caution. This is because, as I have mentioned, the Singapore Tables are based on life expectancy data between 1992 and 2012.

This figure is generally consistent with the Singapore data and also closest to the life expectancy of a Swiss male at 40 years of age, which is the profile most closely comparable to the plaintiff. The number of periods of the plaintiff’s loss in respect of future medical expenses is thus 81 minus 44 years (the age of the plaintiff at the assessment date), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 37 years.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The discount rate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The plaintiff makes the same argument on the discount rate here as he does for loss of future earnings.

The same reasoning applies to the plaintiff’s future medical expenses. I did not find it necessary to analyse the proper treatment of inflation in assessing the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings.

There are two fatal flaws in the plaintiff’s case. First, the inflation data pertains to healthcare inflation <span class="font-italic">in general</span>. Data at such a high level of generality is of limited use. The plaintiff’s loss is the cost of a limited basket of specific medical treatments. There is nothing to suggest that the general inflation data applies to these specific medical treatments. Second, the plaintiff’s treatments are expected to continue decades into the future. There is nothing in the data itself to suggest that the high inflation rate cited by the plaintiff will continue decades into the future. Nor has the plaintiff adduced any expert economic evidence to that effect. I also note that the inflation data, even on the plaintiff’s own evidence, appears to be fluctuating widely, by close to an order of magnitude (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 10% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In summary, the plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence, either factual or expert, to satisfy me that the plaintiff’s future medical expenses will increase at an overall rate of 2% per annum for the duration of his loss.

But this is not a qualification of the general principle of <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. Instead, the requirement of reasonableness arises because medical expenses, properly analysed, are steps which the plaintiff takes to alleviate the loss and damage which a plaintiff suffers by reason of the tort. The requirement of reasonableness is simply an aspect of the plaintiff’s so-called “duty” to mitigate his loss: a plaintiff will not be able to recover any loss which he has incurred by acting unreasonably after suffering the tort (<span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 4-059).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 That is not the end of the defendant’s submission.

</div> In response, the defendant makes two points. First, the cost of the plaintiff’s botox treatment may decrease in the future. Second, that if the plaintiff undergoes a particular surgical procedure – a “functional muscle transfer” (see [196] below) – the frequency of his future botox treatment may also decline. For these two reasons, the defendant argues for a 25% downward adjustment of the sum awarded for the plaintiff’s botox treatment costs to $4,500 per annum.

Having said that, I am satisfied on the basis of Dr Wong’s evidence that the annual cost of the plaintiff’s botox treatment will not decline over the period of the plaintiff’s loss. All that Dr Wong accepted is that there is a possibility that these costs will decrease. Dr Wong also testified that the plaintiff “is developing more and more of these abnormal [facial] movements now. That’s why [the botox dosage has] gradually been coming up” and that “Over time, I see the dosage of botox he will need will be likely to increase”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 I now turn to the plaintiff’s requirement that his caregiver be a native English speaker. Again, I consider this requirement can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. It is true that the experts gave evidence that live-in caregivers, being from overseas, generally have only a basic facility with English. But this evidence was of a general nature. It does not follow that <span class="font-italic">all</span> private nurses are more proficient in English than <span class="font-italic">all</span> live-in caregivers just because the former is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and the latter is not. Further, the experts did not focus specifically on live-in caregivers provided by the agency identified by the defendant, Active Global Specialised Caregivers Pte Ltd. That agency says that the live-in caregivers it recruits “speak good English”.

</div> In addition, it is always possible to ask the agency to recruit a live-in caregiver who has greater facility with English than the usual live-in caregiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The plaintiff’s next requirement is that the caregiver possess socio-cultural sensitivity. Again, I consider this requirement can reasonably be met by a live-in caregiver. Once again, it is too much of a generalisation to assume that <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ll</span> private nurses will be more socio-culturally sensitive than <span class="font-italic">all</span> live-in caregivers just because the former are Singapore citizens or permanent residents. In any event, socio-cultural sensitivity is a matter of experience. And there is nothing to suggest that a live-in caregiver will not acquire the requisite sensitivity in the course of assisting the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The plaintiff’s final requirement is that the caregiver work only 12 hours a day. I consider that a full-time, live-in caregiver will offer more complete care for the plaintiff than a part-time private nurse. First, the experts have given evidence that a caregiver will have to assist the plaintiff with his activities of daily living. A full-time, live-in caregiver will offer the plaintiff substantially more assistance with his activities of daily living than a part-time private nurse. Secondly, part-time private nurses work on rotation. This means that the plaintiff will get a different private nurse to care for him on different days. The experts agree that this may not be ideal because no single private nurse would be able to build up familiarity with the plaintiff and his specific needs.

</div> The plaintiff’s main concern about a live-in caregiver is that his residence has no physical space to accommodate her, and that engaging a live-in caregiver would create a noisy and crowded environment which would aggravate his condition.

</div> However, I take the view that the plaintiff’s concern is exaggerated, and that the advantages of having a full-time caregiver would outweigh the disadvantages. I also bear in mind that a private nurse is more expensive than a live-in caregiver by a factor of ten.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 For all of these reasons, I am satisfied that a live-in caregiver is the appropriate and reasonable mode of giving care to the plaintiff. The rates for a live-in caregiver vary according to the caregiver’s qualifications and experience. Given the serious nature of the plaintiff’s injuries and his resulting needs, I take the view that a live-in caregiver of the highest level of qualifications and experience would be the most appropriate. On the evidence presented to me, such a live-in caregiver would be one with a Bachelor of Science (Nursing) degree from her home country and more than a decade of experience. The salary for such a live-in caregiver is <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$1,000</span> per month or <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$12,000</span> per year.

The reasonable number of trips for treatment for the plaintiff’s seizures is therefore awarded as claimed by the plaintiff: four per year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The number of trips per annum which the plaintiff will have to make for recurring medical treatment is thus the agreed 78 trips plus a further five trips for recurring treatment for neuropsychological consultation and reviews and his seizures.

The defendant submits that the cost should be at the lower end of the range at $20 because private-hire transport fares (such as Grab) from the plaintiff’s home to the clinics is below $10 per one-way trip.

But in this case, I am attempting to calculate the present value of a lump sum which will not be drawn on until 2025 and the value of which will fall to zero when the plaintiff reaches 81 years of age. Accordingly, the income earned on this lump sum at the discount rate will compound without any deduction for the first five years. In other words, this lump sum will not be drawn down to pay for psychiatric care until 2025. So, from 2020 to 2025, the entire income which the plaintiff earns on this lump sum will augment the capital and itself yield a return. Be that as it may, I do not consider the differences to be material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 On the arithmetic method, applying the selected discount rate of 4.25%, the formula yields a multiplier of 17.31.

The facial reconstruction procedures would have no effect on the cognitive damage.

</div> According to the defendant, any psychological issues arising from the plaintiff’s facial injuries are ultimately linked to his ability to communicate and interact with others.

</div> The defendant argues that the tissue transfer, much like the face tightening, targets the plaintiff’s facial symmetry, which is a completely different condition from the synkinesis. In this regard, the defendant relies on Dr Wong’s evidence that even with the tissue transfer, the plaintiff’s face would still be significantly asymmetric. According to the defendant, this means that the tissue transfer is not effective and therefore irrecoverable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 I begin with the defendant’s argument on necessity. The central premise of this argument is that restoring the plaintiff’s facial appearance to its pre-accident state will not enhance his ability to communicate and interact with others. I do not accept this premise. It is true that the parties’ experts gave evidence that the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">speech</span> issues are permanent because of his cognitive deficits and brain injuries.

I reject this argument also. It is true that the plaintiff will continue to suffer from facial asymmetry even after the tissue transfer and the face tightening. But that does not mean that these procedures are so ineffective as to be unreasonable and therefore irrecoverable. The defendant’s submission assesses effectiveness on an <span class="font-italic">absolute </span>basis. On the defendant’s submission, a treatment is effective only if it alleviates <span class="font-italic">completely</span> the consequences of a particular injury. This position is in my view incompatible with the nature of post-accident medical treatment, which is to <span class="font-italic">mitigate </span>the damage caused by the accident. Inherent in the idea of mitigation is a recognition that a complete return to the pre-injury condition may not always be possible. In my view, effectiveness is better assessed on a <span class="font-italic">relative </span>basis. A treatment is effective, and its cost is therefore recoverable, if it is likely to produce a reasonable improvement in the plaintiff’s condition as compared to his current condition, even if his improved condition is not identical to his pre-accident condition.

</div> In other words, speech therapy will give the plaintiff a workaround and allow him to restore his participation level in relation to the activity of communication even though his impairment level in relation remains severe and irreversible. The plaintiff never quite elaborated on how this workaround would work, but I assume him to mean that he can be taught to communicate <span class="font-italic">non-verbally </span>as opposed to <span class="font-italic">verbally</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I can accept that treatment which focuses on improving the plaintiff’s ability to communicate with others must necessarily be plaintiff-centric. However, it does not follow that such plaintiff-centric treatment must necessarily be speech therapy.

Therefore, this recommendation of speech therapy must have been directed at the plaintiff.

All Dr Collinson is saying is that <span class="font-italic">speech pathology tests</span> are an accurate way to chart the plaintiff’s recovery.

The plaintiff’s social anxiety comes from his communication difficulties. If speech therapy proves ineffective at alleviating these difficulties (which is likely to be the case), the plaintiff’s communication issues will remain and so will his social anxiety. If speech therapy proves effective, the plaintiff’s social anxiety may improve. But this would involve an unreasonable level of effort and resources.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 In summary, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the costs of speech therapy treatment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Communication training</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 In relation to communication training, the defendant (rightly) does not argue that it is not effective. Ms Sajlia gave evidence, which was not seriously contested, that communication training can enhance the plaintiff’s activity participation level despite his impairment level remaining severe and irreversible. This is because the plaintiff’s communication partner will be taught to understand him better. This in turn will alleviate the plaintiff’s difficulties in making himself understood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 However, the defendant argues instead that communication training is not necessary, at least as between the plaintiff and his wife.

</div> There is thus no empirical evidence on how long the effects of communication training can last past the six-month period, meaning that communication training may very well prove effective for the plaintiff’s life.

</div> As I have held earlier in calculating the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings, the plaintiff would have been promoted from ED to MDSA only in 2020 (see [107] above). Therefore, for the period from 2015 to 2019, the plaintiff’s base salary would not have increased by reason of a promotion. However, he would still have been awarded the usual annual increments, assumed to be a constant 2.5% per annum. The average of the plaintiff’s base salary for the period between 2015 and 2019 inclusive would thus be his base salary for the year 2017, which would be <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, 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"/></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 In addition to his base salary, the plaintiff would also have earned bonuses for these three years. I have found that the plaintiff would have earned average yearly bonuses of 35% of his base salary from 2020 onwards (see [121] above). I am inclined to adopt a slightly different average yearly bonus rate for the period from 2015 to 2019 inclusive, as evidence exists, and has been tendered, about the state of the economy in general and the private banking industry specifically for this period. Having considered the evidence, I am minded to adjust the average yearly bonus figure downwards to 25%.

I agree with the defendant that the wife’s loss of income is not recoverable as such in an action by the plaintiff. Given that there is no rule in Singapore barring recovery in negligence for pure economic loss, it is conceivable that the plaintiff’s wife may in principle have a cause of action against the defendant in tort on the basis that the defendant owed her a duty of care not to injure her husband, on the application of the universal test set out in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100. However, the plaintiff’s wife is not a party to this action and asserts no such claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 The only legal route for the plaintiff to recover his wife’s loss is therefore to recharacterise her loss as his loss.

</div> it makes no difference whether the wife suffered a loss of <span class="font-italic">past</span> or <span class="font-italic">future</span> income. In fact, the lost income claimed in <span class="font-italic">Don</span><span class="font-italic">nelly </span>was the income which the tort victim’s mother had given up the opportunity of earning <span class="font-italic">in the past</span> in order to take care of the victim. Therefore, the income which the plaintiff’s wife gave up the opportunity to earn in order to look after the plaintiff ought to be only a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> in assessing the monetary value of plaintiff’s loss. If it was reasonable to secure care for the plaintiff at a cost <span class="font-italic">below</span> the income which his wife lost, the defendant is not liable for the cost of providing care measured by the plaintiff’s wife’s lost income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 In this case, I have no hesitation in finding that this starting point ought to be departed from. As I have held earlier at [177], the reasonable cost of care for the plaintiff is $1,000 per month. That is true just as much for the plaintiff’s pre-trial care as it is for his future care. I therefore find that $1,000 per month is the ceiling for the plaintiff’s claim for his wife’s lost income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 There remains another issue. The defendant argues, in effect, that the plaintiff cannot recover damages for the care given by his wife for those periods when the plaintiff employed a second live-in foreign domestic worker. The plaintiff responds that the additional foreign domestic worker was hired to help his wife and their first foreign domestic worker look after the children, not the plaintiff. And therefore, the plaintiff’s wife remained the plaintiff’s full-time caregiver throughout the years since the accident, even when they employed a second foreign domestic worker.

I therefore do not find the plaintiff’s evidence to be of much weight (leaving aside whether the documents in the supplementary bundle of documents were properly in evidence before me). The plaintiff also criticises the defendant’s evidence for not being sufficiently contemporaneous, and for failing to consider that he needed to buy a flexible ticket, instead of non-refundable and non-changeable, because he did not know how long his treatment in Zurich would take. These are both fair criticisms, but they do not detract from the fact that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. A flexible business class ticket from Singapore to Zurich would undoubtedly have cost more than the defendant’s estimate of $5,700. But equally undoubtedly, it would have cost less than the plaintiff’s estimate of $10,200.

I am thus not convinced that it was necessary for the plaintiff’s wife to accompany him on his flights (since she actually did not accompany him for most of his travels). It follows that there was no reason for the wife to fly business class, other than the fact that she was perhaps accustomed to this standard of travel. But this is not a good reason to make the defendant liable for the additional cost thereby incurred (see <span class="font-italic">Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2016] 4 SLR 829 at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 Second, there was no reason connected to the plaintiff’s injuries or treatment for the plaintiff’s wife to have flown to Zurich via Budapest.

Moreover, I note that the wife actually stayed with the children in Budapest for the majority of the plaintiff’s treatment in Zurich. It follows that it was possible for the wife to have returned to Singapore to take care of the children after traveling with the plaintiff to Zurich.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277  I therefore am of the view that the measure of recoverable damages for the wife’s travel costs is limited to the price of economy class tickets from Singapore to Zurich and back. I am willing to give the wife the benefit of the doubt and allow a claim in respect of two flexible, one-way tickets instead of one flexible return ticket or two unchangeable one-way tickets. I note that the evidence tendered by the parties does not shed light on the price of such a ticket. However, I am not willing to accept the defendant’s position that the absence of evidence precludes recovery. Taking into account the general pricing level of economy class tickets to Europe, which I estimate to be $2,000 per sector, I allow the plaintiff to recover $4,000 in respect of his wife’s travel costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Travel costs of plaintiff’s children and family maid</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 The defendant resists the claim for the children’s and the family’s foreign domestic worker travel costs, arguing that it was not necessary for the plaintiff’s children and the family’s foreign domestic worker to have travelled with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 I agree with the defendant. It appears to me evident that the plaintiff’s children and the family’s foreign domestic worker did not travel for a reason connected to the plaintiff’s injuries or his treatment. Instead, the children and the maid travelled to Budapest because the plaintiff and his wife did not want to leave the children behind in Singapore. As I have explained in [276] above, while I am sympathetic to the plaintiff’s predicament, I am not satisfied that this was <span class="font-italic">necessary</span>, in the absence of evidence about the care that the children would have received had they stayed in Singapore, and in light of the fact that the wife did not stay with the plaintiff for the majority of his treatment in Zurich, staying with the children in Budapest instead.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Travel costs of the plaintiff’s parents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 The plaintiff’s father visited him twice within three months of the accident.

The plaintiff’s mother accompanied the plaintiff’s father on the first visit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 The defendant resists the plaintiff’s claim on the ground that there is no objective evidence to show that the parents’ presence assisted with the plaintiff’s recovery.

</div> The defendant characterises as self-serving the plaintiff’s statement of subjective belief that he needed to be around his loved ones to recuperate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 The arguments raised by the parties in this regard elides a key consideration, that is, whether these tickets were paid for by the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span>. As stated above (at [253]), the plaintiff can only seek to recover <span class="font-italic">his own loss </span>in these proceedings. Therefore, the plaintiff must first show that <span class="font-italic">he </span>was the one who paid for his parents’ trips, before he can even begin to argue that the trips were necessary. This is because the plaintiff bears the burden of proof. And since this is an item of special damage, and therefore a historical and actual loss, he bears the burden of proof on the usual balance of probabilities. The evidence as tendered by the plaintiff does not show <span class="font-italic">who </span>paid for his parents’ tickets.

</div> The plaintiff had to estimate these costs because he was unable to retrieve most of the booking documents for the flights, having booked the flights some months before the accident. His estimate came from a software known as “ITA Matrix”, which purportedly “allows users to search for flights using historical data”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 The defendant resists this head of claim. According to him, this claim is too remote. Even if it is not too remote, it is not sufficiently proven. The defendant takes issue with the plaintiff’s lack of documentary evidence, which goes both to the amount of money spent by the plaintiff on the tickets and also to whether the plaintiff had made reasonable efforts to mitigate his loss by cancelling these flights and obtaining a full or partial refund. Further, the defendant also argues that he should only be liable for the costs of economy class, and not first-class tickets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 I accept that this head of claim is not too remote. The test for remoteness in the tort of negligence is the same as that in the law of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that of reasonable foreseeability (see <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 8-086, <span class="font-italic">Man Mohan Singh s/o Jothirambal Singh and another v Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (now known as QBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd) and another and another appeal</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 735 at [45]). It is difficult to see why the plaintiff’s loss arising from having to cancel booked flights is not reasonably foreseeable. It is no defence for the defendant to say that he did not know that the plaintiff was someone who had booked multiple flights on business and first class that he would have to cancel.

My concern lies specifically with the plaintiff’s failure to adduce evidence of the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which he purchased the flight tickets. Specifically, the issue here relates to the plaintiff’s so-called “<span class="font-italic">duty</span><span class="font-italic">” to mitigate</span>. It is not uncommon for ticket vendors to allow refunds, particularly on grounds of supervening events such as accident. It is also not uncommon for air tickets purchased with credit cards to be covered by insurance. In such a situation, the plaintiff would need to show either that there were no refunds available, or that he could not have availed himself of the refunds in spite of reasonable efforts. In the absence of any evidence to this regard, I find that the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proof.
