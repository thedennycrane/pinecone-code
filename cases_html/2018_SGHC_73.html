The plaintiff was one of the companies on the approved panel of warranty surveyors for Miller Insurance. In an email dated 10 September 2013, Miller Insurance contacted the plaintiff, informing them of the potential assignment of conducting the marine warranty survey for the Rigs.

</div> The defendant’s Malaysian solicitors, M/s Raman Velu &amp; Co replied stating that their client would not be complying with the letter of demand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The plaintiff therefore commenced this suit against the defendant on 18 January 2016, to claim for the unpaid sums under the Second, Third and Fourth Invoices.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff’s case is that it had contracted with the defendant for the marine warranty survey services that it had rendered in relation to the Rigs. This is evident from the written documents that form the Contract, namely the 11 September 2013 Email and the Purchase Order. Therefore, the defendant is liable for the unpaid sums under the Second, Third and Fourth Invoices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The defendant’s case, on the other hand, is that they had issued the Purchase Order to the plaintiff for and on behalf of Dragon, as Dragon’s agent. They rely on the 17 September Email, to assert that the plaintiff must have been aware that the Contract was always understood to be between the plaintiff and Dragon, and that the defendant was merely acting as an agent. Accordingly, the defendant is not liable to make payment of the Second, Third and Fourth Invoices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Additionally, the defendant asserts that Dragon had ratified the Contract, thereby allowing Dragon (the purported principal) to adopt the defendant’s (the purported agent) past acts. Therefore, the defendant argues that it is Dragon which should be liable for the unpaid sums, and not the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In order to ascertain if it is the defendant or Dragon that should rightfully be liable under the Contract, these are the issues that have to be determined:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether, as a matter of law, the defendant is personally liable under the contract, given that there was no qualification that it was acting as agent when it affixed its signature and company stamp on the Purchase Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether extrinsic evidence can be adduced to contradict what is stated in the Contract; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether Dragon’s subsequent ratification of the Contract absolves the defendant of liability. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: whether the defendant should, as a matter of law, be personally liable under the Contract given that its signature was unqualified </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is clear on the face of the Purchase Order that the defendant’s signature under the company stamp was unqualified. As stated above, Taib himself accepted during cross-examination that there was nothing on the face of the Purchase Order to indicate that the defendant was contracting on behalf of Dragon and not in its personal capacity. Therefore, the issue to be determined is whether, as a matter of law, the defendant is necessarily liable under the Contract given that it contains the defendant’s unqualified signature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The law of agency places very specific emphasis on the manner in which a purported agent affixes his or her signature to a contract. In particular, where a written contract, objectively construed, does not indicate in clear terms that the signatory is contracting on behalf of someone else, the signatory will be taken to be personally liable under the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This general principle is clearly set out in Prof Tan Cheng Han, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span>”) at para 09.004:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It may also be the case that an agent, <span class="font-italic">despite intending to act as agent only, enters into a contract in such a manner as to be personally liable under it to the exclusion of the principal</span>. This may arise because <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the agent has not contracted in a manner that make</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">s it clear that he is only acting on behalf of another person with no personal liability whatsoever</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">Thus, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">under an objective interpretation of the contract, he, and only he, is regarded as a party to it</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> <span class="font-italic">It does not matter that he intended something else as the law deems that he intends the consequences of what he has entered into, objectively construed</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In support of this proposition, Prof Tan cites <span class="font-italic">Teheran-Europe Co Ltd v S T Belton (Tractors) Ltd</span> [1968] 2 QB 53 (QBD) at 59–60 and <span class="font-italic">Gadd v Houghton</span> (1876) 1 Ex D 357 at 360. Both these cases show that in determining the proper parties to a contract, the names of the signatories to the written contract are a very strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> indication as to who the contracting parties are. The cases further emphasise that where the agent did not intend for personal liability to attach to him, there must be a very clear indication of such an intention. For example, the signature must be claused “as agents only” or something to similar effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the more recent English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Internaut Shipping GmbH and Sphinx Navigation Limited of Liberia v Fercometal Sarl (The Elikon)</span> [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 403 (“<span class="font-italic">The Elikon</span>”), the Court reiterated this principle, in coming to a decision on who the proper parties to a charterparty were. Internaut Shipping GmbH (“Internaut”), a small broking firm, had signed a charterparty for the vessel The Elikon under the heading “Owners”, without any qualification. In actual fact, it was Sphinx Navigation Limited of Liberia which was the registered owner of The Elikon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Nevertheless, the Court held that Internaut was personally liable under the charterparty. Rix LJ, in delivering the leading judgment of the Court, considered three English precedents and concluded at [46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What remains, however, is that in all three cases <span class="font-italic">a party who was expressly said in the body of the contract to be an “agent” or to be acting on behalf of a principal was nevertheless adjudged to have personal liability</span> in circumstances where, again in all three cases, <span class="font-italic">the agent signed without qualification</span>. This permits the extraction of a principle, which in my view can be found stated as at least part of the reasoning in those cases that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the way in which a party named in a contract </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">signs that contract may be of particular strength in the overall question of whether he is a party to that contract with personal liability under it</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, it was held at [51] that because Internaut had signed the charterparty without any qualification, its liability was firmly established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Rix LJ went on to elucidate at [53] the rationale for paying particular attention to <span class="font-italic">the form of the signature</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t reflects the commercial facts of life, the promptings of <span class="font-italic">commercial common sense</span>. The signature is, as it were, the party’s seal upon the contract; and that remains the case even where, as here, the contract has already been made… Prima facie <span class="font-italic">a person does not sign a document without intending to be bound under it</span><span class="font-italic">, or, to put that thought in the objective rather than subjective form, without properly being regarded as intending to be bound under it</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Indeed, in the realm of contract where intention is paramount, an unqualified signature affixed to a contract should be taken as an objective indication of the signatory’s intention to be bound. To hold otherwise would be to derogate from contractual certainty, which would in turn affect commercial certainty. To my mind, this rationale holds with equal force in the present case, and I see no reason not to accept this principle as good law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 A similar matter was previously considered by the Singapore High Court. In <span class="font-italic">Todd Trading Pte Ltd v Aglow Far East Trading Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Todd Trading</span>”), the plaintiff claimed damages from the defendant for breach of contract. The defendant’s main defence was that it was acting as an agent for a <span class="font-italic">disclosed</span> principal buyer, and thus it should not be held liable as buyer under the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Kan Ting Chiu J held at [37] that the disclosure of a principal does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> release the agent from liability. The disclosure alone is not, without more, evidence of the party’s intention to be absolved of personal liability under the contract. Given that there was nothing in the agreement, nor in the conduct of the parties, that suggested that the defendant did not intend to contract personally, the defendant was accordingly held to be personally liable to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The defendant in the present case has sought to argue that in the course of its dealings with the plaintiff, it had always made known that it was acting as agent for Dragon. At this point, I note that the plaintiff, in its closing submissions, has argued that at the point of contracting, the defendant had never informed them of the existence of Dragon.

</div> Therefore, at best, Dragon was an <span class="font-italic">undisclosed principal</span>. In this regard, I would disagree with the plaintiff. To my mind, the 17 September Email was sufficient to give notice to the plaintiff that the defendant and Dragon had an agency relationship. Therefore, at the point of the conclusion of the contract on 19 September 2013, when the plaintiff acknowledged the Purchase Order, Dragon was in fact a <span class="font-italic">disclosed principal</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Be that as it may, I agree with Kan J’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Todd Trading</span>, that the defendant’s disclosure of Dragon as its principal does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>release it from liability. On the face of the Contract, there is nothing to suggest that the defendant did not intend to contract personally, given that the signature under the company stamp was unqualified. Therefore, the defendant should be personally liable under the Contract, notwithstanding that it had disclosed its principal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I would answer Issue 1 in the affirmative. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: whether extrinsic evidence can be adduced to contradict what is stated in the Contract as to who the parties are</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendant relies on the 17 September Email (see [10] above) to assert that the plaintiff must have known that the Contract was to be between the plaintiff and Dragon, and that the defendant was therefore not personally liable. However, this contradicts what is expressly stated in the Purchase Order. Accordingly, the next issue that I have to consider is whether extrinsic evidence, in the form of the 17 September Email, can be adduced to contradict the express terms of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In general, the courts do not allow extrinsic evidence to be adduced to contradict or reinterpret the express terms of a contract where these terms are clear and unambiguous. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span><span class="font-italic"> (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 stated at [116] that where the “contractual language … was plain and unambiguous in reference to the existing facts”, extrinsic evidence should not be adduced to contradict the clear terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 More specifically, in the context of agency, Article 100(1) of <span class="font-italic">Bowstead &amp; Reynolds</span> (Peter G. Watts gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2006) (“Bowstead”) at para 9–039 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where it is <span class="font-italic">clear from the terms of a written contract</span> made by an agent <span class="font-italic">that he contracted personally</span>, <span class="font-italic">extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that</span>, notwithstanding the terms of the contract, <span class="font-italic">it was the intention of the parties that he should not be personally liable on it</span>, because such evidence would be contradictory to the written contract. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Similarly, it is stated in Sir Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2015) (“Lewison”) at para 10.07 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Extrinsic evidence is admissible to identify the parties to a contract, by way of exception to the parol evidence rule. However, although evidence is admissible to identify parties to a contract, <span class="font-italic">where the parties are specifically named in a written contract, evidence is not admissible for the purpose of showing that others (who were not named) were also parties to the contract</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I would note parenthetically that the commentary to Art 100(1) of Bowstead (at para 9–040) states that although extrinsic evidence may not be adduced to <span class="font-italic">delete</span> an apparent contracting party, it may be adduced to <span class="font-italic">add</span> a party. This “addition” might occur in situations where, for example, the liability of the principal has to be established in addition to that of the agent. A more stringent view is taken in Lewison at para 10.07, which states that where the contracting parties have been specifically named in the contract, evidence is <span class="font-italic">not admissible</span> to show that others (who were not named) were also parties to the contract. Therefore, on this approach, it appears that extrinsic evidence cannot even be adduced to “add” a party to the contract. However, the defendant in the present case is seeking to adduce extrinsic evidence to absolve itself of liability under the Contract or, in other words, delete itself as a party to the Contract. Therefore, there is no need for me to comment on whether I prefer the approach taken by Bowstead or Lewison, given that both textbooks are in agreement that extrinsic evidence cannot be used to delete an apparent contracting party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This position is also reinforced by the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson</span> [2004] 1 AC 919 (“<span class="font-italic">Shogun Finance</span>”). In that case, a car dealer agreed to sell a car on hire-purchase to a fraudster who falsely claimed to be the person named in the driving license which he produced. The claimant hire-purchase company approved of the sale upon completing satisfactory credit checks on the person named on the driving license. The hire-purchase agreement was subsequently concluded, with the “hirer” on the agreement identified as the person named on the driving license. The fraudster took possession of the car, and subsequently sold it to the defendant, who purchased it in good faith. The claimant thereafter brought the suit to claim the return of the car from the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 A majority of the House of Lords found in favour of the claimant, on the basis that the fraudster never had good title to the car, and hence could not have passed good title to the defendant. In reaching that conclusion, the majority held that the agreement should be construed based on what was <span class="font-italic">expressly stated in the hire-purchase agreement</span>. The purported contract between the fraudster and the claimant was constituted by the hire-purchase agreement, under which the hirer was stated to be the person named on the driving license, and not the fraudster. Extrinsic evidence could not be adduced to contradict the terms of the written agreement so as to find that the fraudster had been the true hirer, instead of the person named on the driving license. Accordingly, title to the car was never transferred to the fraudster.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 There is no ambiguity in the Contract in the present case. The defendant was signatory to the Purchase Order without qualification or equivocation. Accordingly, no extrinsic evidence is admissible to relieve it of liability under the Contract. I therefore answer the second issue in the negative.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The equivocality of the 17 September Email</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I would add that even if I had found that extrinsic evidence was admissible, I do not think that the 17 September Email is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff had absolved itself of liability under the Contract. It is true that the defendant had copied Dragon in the 17 September Email. The Email also quoted Dragon’s earlier email to the defendant, where Dragon had instructed the defendant to procure marine warranty surveys for the Rigs, and to keep them “in the loop”. All that this demonstrates, is that the plaintiff should have known of Dragon’s existence, and that they were the ones instructing the defendant to procure services from the plaintiff. It does not, however, go as far as to demonstrate that the plaintiff must have known that they were contracting with Dragon as opposed to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The more reasonable interpretation that the plaintiff would have taken was that the defendant would personally procure the marine warranty survey services from the plaintiff, and subsequently seek a reimbursement of the cost from Dragon. This arrangement was in fact borne out on the evidence, as seen from how the defendant invoiced Dragon for the fees charged by the plaintiff plus an additional 10% service charge (see [18] above). Furthermore, payment for the First Invoice was made by the defendant directly from their own bank account (see [17] above). Therefore, even if I had allowed extrinsic evidence to be adduced, the 17 September Email is equivocal at best, and it does not bring the defendant’s case very far.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: whether Dragon’s subsequent ratification of the Contract absolves the defendant of liability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In its closing submissions, the defendant relies on the email dated 20 April 2014 (see [22] above), in which they were instructed by Dragon to request the plaintiff to forward the invoices for the services rendered directly to Dragon, to demonstrate that Dragon had ratified the Contract.

</div>
</div> Hence, the  argues that Dragon should held liable under the Contract. In my view, this is a misapplication of the doctrine of ratification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is trite law that ratification is used when a principal wishes to take the benefit of an unauthorised act done by his or her agent. Ratification allows the principal to retrospectively clothe the agent with authority, such that the agent is taken to have been authorised from the outset (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> at para 06.004). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The defendant’s case has never been that it <span class="font-italic">lacked authority</span> to enter the Contract on behalf of Dragon. Neither has the plaintiff sought to argue that the defendant lacked authority to contract on behalf of Dragon. On the contrary, the defendant’s entire defence is predicated on the assertion that they have always had <span class="font-italic">actual authority</span> to contract with the plaintiff on behalf of Dragon. Therefore, even if I accept that Dragon had validly ratified the Contract, thereby clothing the defendant with actual authority to act on its behalf, the question would still remain whether the defendant had made it sufficiently clear in the written documents that it did not intend to be personally liable under the Contract. For the reasons already stated above, I find that the written documents constituting the Contract unequivocally demonstrate that the defendant had entered into the agreement with the plaintiff in its own personal capacity. Accordingly, my decision remains unchanged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interest payable by the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 There is one final issue that I have to address, that being the interest payable by the defendant on the unpaid invoices. The parties do not dispute that the plaintiff’s Standard Terms form part of the Contract. Therefore, clause 5.2 of the plaintiff’s Standard Terms is relevant. It states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.2 Payment of fees are due within 30 (thirty) days of the invoice date. Company reserves the right to charge interest at a rate of 1% per month on invoices remaining unpaid after 30 (thirty) days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 However, the Purchase Order, which was sent subsequent to the plaintiff’s Standard Terms and duly acknowledged by the plaintiff, provides for payment terms of 90 days instead. In my view, this represented a valid counteroffer from the defendant and it was accepted by the plaintiff. However, given that no counteroffer was made with regard to the interest that would be charged after the expiry of the payment period, the interest rate as provided for in clause 5.2 should still stand. Accordingly, interest on the unpaid invoices should be calculated at 1% of the invoiced sum per month that the invoice remains unpaid, with time to start running 90 days after the issuance of the relevant invoice. Indeed, the plaintiff had used these figures in the calculation of the interest payable. I would therefore allow the plaintiff’s claim for interest in full, in the amount of USD 52,051.02.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In conclusion, I find the defendant liable under the Contract. I therefore allow the plaintiff’s claim for USD 130,642.33, that being the total sum due under the Second, Third and Fourth Invoices together with interest amounting to USD 52,051.02.
