When that arises, how should the conflict be resolved, especially if the consequence of giving effect to one clause would defeat or emasculate the substance of another clause? Should the court take into account the parties’ subjective understanding of the ambit of such clauses or the parties’ subsequent conduct in order to reconcile the discord as contended by the parties? Curiously, the parties seek to rely on these matters to achieve opposing interpretations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This conundrum lies at the heart of the two cross appeals before us. Two doctors specialising in aesthetic treatment co-owned and operated two clinics, one of which is the appellant company, the Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd (“CLAM”). In 2013, a dispute arose between the two doctors which led to the commencement of an earlier set of legal proceedings. Thereafter, a settlement agreement (“the Agreement”) was concluded between the two doctors on 14 February 2014<span class="font-italic"> </span>to resolve the dispute following a successful mediation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Agreement is essentially an exit arrangement whereby the two doctors were to procure the sale of the two clinics at a minimum price of $6m by 31 December 2016. Pending the sale of the two clinics, the two doctors were obliged to continue to fulfil their respective responsibilities to the two clinics on their assigned days. However, recognising the impending parting of ways, both doctors agreed that they would, in the meantime, be allowed to set up their own competing clinics. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 It will be immediately apparent that the presence of a clause in the Agreement which obliged the doctors to continue with their responsibilities to the two clinics together with a clause which permitted them to operate competing clinics was a recipe for further disputes. This was precisely the root cause of the present action. Ironically, perhaps in anticipation of such disputes, a further provision was drafted into the Agreement to prevent the doctors from raising any allegation or claim in respect of diversion of patients from the two clinics to the new clinics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 One of the two doctors, Dr Goh Pui Kiat (“Dr Goh PK” or “the first defendant”), set up his new clinic, GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd (“GPK Clinic”), two doors away from the clinic operated by CLAM. This was permitted under the Agreement. He then copied the patient and inventory database of CLAM without the permission of the other doctor, Dr Kelvin Goh Yong Chiang (“Dr Kelvin Goh”). Using the information in the database, the first defendant actively diverted patients from CLAM to GPK Clinic. Thereafter, CLAM, which is strictly not a party to the Agreement, commenced the present action against the first to third defendants: respectively, Dr Gok PK, his wife Wong Hwee Leng (“Mdm Wong”) and GPK Clinic (collectively, “the defendants”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) found the first and third defendants liable to CLAM for breach of confidence and for conspiracy to injure with regard to the unauthorised copying of the database. However, he dismissed the claim in respect of the diversion of patients on the basis that the Agreement<span class="font-italic"> expressly</span> permitted such diversion (see <span class="font-italic">Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Pui Kiat and others </span>[2017] SGHC 72 at [34] (“the GD”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Both parties appealed against the decision though the defendants’ appeal is only against the costs order. CLAM’s principal argument on appeal is that the clause which precludes the parties under the Agreement from raising any allegation or claim for diversion of patients cannot be read to mean that the parties are at liberty to<span class="font-italic"> actively</span> divert patients to their new clinics with impunity. That is because the effect of such a construction would deplete the two clinics of their patients and thereby defeat the main purpose of the Agreement, which was to facilitate the disengagement of the doctors’ existing relationship in a controlled and mutually beneficial manner over a period of almost three years, culminating in a sale of the two clinics at a minimum price of $6m. The defendants, on the other hand, maintain that diversion of patients is inherent in the competition which is expressly permitted under the Agreement and, accordingly, CLAM’s interpretation is untenable.

The court’s role is to examine the clauses so as to give effect to the Agreement construed as a whole. In doing so, we will examine the utility, if any, of the parties’ subjective understanding of the clauses as well as their subsequent conduct in order to derive the proper construction and interpretation of the Agreement. In the final analysis, the pivotal inquiry is whether the terms of the Agreement permitted the parties to “harm” CLAM notwithstanding their fiduciary duties to CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Material Background Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Dr Kelvin Goh and Dr Goh PK (collectively, “the doctors”) worked at Orchard MD Clinic &amp; Surgery Singapore (“the Orchard Clinic”) on different days, such that one of them would be on duty at the Orchard Clinic on any given day of the week.

It would <span class="font-italic">still</span> be a breach if the doctors were merely permitted under the Agreement to set up competing clinics pending the completion of the sale of the Companies; that would by implication cover the parties’ treatment of patients who patronised the competing clinics without any solicitation by the doctors, but it would not, without more, cover active diversion. A defence based on that alone would be unsustainable. In the present case, however, the contract goes further than that by including the rather unusual proviso, in cl 10, that “[f]or the avoidance of doubt, none of the Parties shall make any allegation or make any claim in respect of diversion of patients/customers from MPC or CLAM” (“the cl 10 proviso”). Moreover, it is common ground between the parties that, even though CLAM is not a party to the Agreement, the Agreement can alter the contents of the directors’ duties to CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Consequently, the key inquiry in these cross appeals is whether the cl 10 proviso altered Dr Goh PK and Mdm Wong’s obligations to CLAM such that they were effectively permitted to cause harm to CLAM notwithstanding their continuing fiduciary duties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The competing interpretations of cl 10 of the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For ease of reference, we reproduce, in full, cl 10 and cl 7 of the Agreement.

Clearly, it would not be possible to ascribe both clauses their ordinary and literal meanings. How then should these two clauses be read harmoniously in light of each other?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Judge resolved this conundrum by ascribing a minimalist interpretation to cl 7 to justify his expansive reading of cl 10. The Judge held that cl 7 only applied “where patients chose to continue to be treated at Orchard Clinic. In such cases, [Dr] Goh PK was obliged to attend to these patients at Orchard Clinic on his assigned days” (the GD at [33]). In addition, although the Judge did not state this expressly, he presumably also considered that cl 7 obliged Dr Goh PK to perform the following basic tasks at the Orchard Clinic which Dr Goh PK in fact<span class="font-italic"> </span>performed<span class="font-italic"> </span>(the GD at [23(b)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… report for work at Orchard Clinic on his assigned days, attend to administrative tasks, see certain patients who had made appointments to see him and sign the daily cash ledgers of Orchard Clinic against the figures showing the takings of the clinic on his assigned days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  Apart from the foregoing, under the Judge’s expansive interpretation of cl 10, the parties were permitted to “to set up competing clinics and to also divert patients from CLAM and MPC” (the GD at [32]).

Where “the text concerned might itself be ambiguous (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without even considering the relevant context) … the relevant context will generally be of the first importance” [emphasis omitted] (at [34]). This court also warned against taking the preceding propositions too far, as the “text and context would often interact with each other”, and that the “process of contractual interpretation is a dynamic one” [emphasis omitted] (at [35]). Finally, it was observed (at [31]) that “there may be <span class="font-italic">exceptional cases</span> where the text is so clearly plain and unambiguous that the court is compelled to give effect to the meaning contained therein, <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding</span> that an <span class="font-italic">absurd</span> result would ensue” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 To address this tension between cll 7 and 10, which at first sight might appear to give rise to some ambiguity, it is crucial to examine the underlying purpose of the Agreement.

The courts have regard to the overall purpose of the parties with respect to a particular transaction” [emphasis added in original], and the second is that “a construction which leads to very unreasonable results is to be avoided <span class="font-italic">unless it is required by clear words and there is no other tenable construction</span>” [emphasis added]. In our view, it is clear that the underlying purpose of the Agreement is to facilitate the exit arrangement of the two doctors <span class="font-italic">via</span> the sale of the Companies as going concerns. This can readily be discerned from the text of the Agreement itself. In undertaking the examination of cl 10, two critical inquiries must be borne in mind. Did the text of cl 10 provide in “plain and unambiguous” terms that active diversion of patients by the parties was permitted? And did the text or context of cl 10 amount to an “exceptional case” to permit the parties to take steps to cause actual harm to the Companies?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Clauses 2 to 5 of the Agreement set out the process as well as the details of a prospective sale of the Companies. Clause 2 of the Agreement provided that the parties “shall have up to 31 December 2016 to procure a sale of MPC and CLAM to any prospective purchaser that <span class="font-italic">meets a minimum agreed consideration price of S$6,000,000.00</span> …” [emphasis added], while cl 3 of the Agreement obliged the parties to enable a sale pursuant to cl 2 of the Agreement. If the sale under cl 2 of the Agreement did not take place, cll 4 and 5 provided for  the Companies to be sold by way of a closed auction amongst the parties.

The corollary to this purpose would oblige the parties to preserve the value of the Companies in the interim. Otherwise, if the parties were free to extract or destroy the value of the Companies in the meantime, the object of selling the Companies at the minimum price of $6m would be in serious jeopardy. Indeed, this purpose was borne out by cl 7 which obliged the parties to continue working for the Companies at the Clinics until the Companies were sold. That obligation only ceased, under cl 6 of the Agreement, <span class="font-italic">upon the sale of the Companies</span> and not any earlier.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The defendants’ submission ignores the fact that cl 2 of the Agreement did not just contemplate <span class="font-italic">any </span>sale: a minimum price of $6m was stipulated. As earlier stated, the target sale price indicates the importance of preserving the value of the Companies in the interim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Seen in this light, the Judge’s expansive reading of cl 10 would do impermissible violence to the underlying purpose of the Agreement. As we elaborate below at [42], the court will be slow to conclude that such an outcome was intended unless it was expressed in explicit language. For this reason, we turn our attention to examine the language of cl 10. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The proper construction of the cl 10 proviso</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It is significant to note that nowhere in cl 10 did it expressly state in <span class="font-italic">positive language</span> that the parties were entitled to divert any patient from CLAM. The crux of the dispute was whether such an entitlement can be read into cl 10 as a matter of construction. As a starting point, the cl 10 proviso was situated within cl 10, which provided that the parties were at liberty to set up competing clinics, and began with the words “[f]or the avoidance of doubt”. Further, the cl 10 proviso must be read in the light of the reality that if either of the doctors set up a competing clinic, some of their existing patients would inevitably end up being served in that new clinic. For reasons we explore in detail below, we find that on its true construction, the cl 10 proviso was intended only to preclude both parties from making any allegation or claim in respect of diversion of patients <span class="font-italic">in those circumstances</span>, recognising that it was unavoidable that existing patients of the Clinics may choose to be treated in the new clinics. In other words, the cl 10 proviso was to serve a very limited purpose to prevent the parties from making allegations or claims from the mere fact of patients being served by the new clinics – in other words, “passive diversion”, as CLAM put it (see above at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This construction was rejected by the Judge because he opined that if patients, on their own accord, sought treatment in the new clinics, that would not be diversion to begin with (the GD at [30]).With respect, this is where the Judge fell into error. He assumed that the cl 10 proviso presupposed a right to divert patients. This is not correct. The cl 10 proviso instead was to prevent the parties from raising allegations or making diversion claims against each other given the inevitability of patients being treated in the new clinics arising from the right of the parties to set up competing clinics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The defendants accept that the effect of their submission is that the cl 10 proviso not only changed their duties to CLAM but in fact permitted them to wilfully harm CLAM. Once the stark reality of the defendants’ submission is placed in this light, it will be immediately apparent that it will require very clear language in the Agreement to support such a construction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Such clear language is not present. On the contrary, the language of cl 10 clearly points <span class="font-italic">away</span> from the defendants’ proposed interpretation. The cl 10 proviso begins with the phrase “[f]or the avoidance of doubt”. This is an indication that the proviso was either unnecessary (see <span class="font-italic">Phoenix Media Ltd v Cobweb Information</span><span class="font-italic"> Limited</span> (High Court (England and Wales),<span class="font-italic"> </span>16 May 2000 (unreported)) at [37], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Neuberger J (as he then was), cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">City of York Council v Trinity One (Leeds) Ltd </span>[2017] EWHC 318 (Ch) at [50]) or was included to avoid or dispel doubts which may have been created by the preceding sentence. In the latter scenario, the proviso would be interpreted in light of the doubt that it was intended to avoid (<span class="font-italic">Shailesh</span><span class="font-italic"> Gondhia &amp; Others v Esso Petroleum Company Limited </span>[2001] EWCA Civ 1070 at [52]–[60], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Chadwick LJ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, the first sentence of cl 10 merely permitted the parties “to set up any other business or clinics in any location in Singapore”; no mention was expressly made of any right to divert patients. We acknowledge that disputes may arise in relation to possible claims for passive diversion (see above at [41]). Given the limited scope of the first sentence, no doubt arises at all as to whether parties could, pursuant to the first sentence, be permitted to<span class="font-italic"> actively</span> divert patients from CLAM with the consequent harm to CLAM. We are therefore unable to agree with the Judge (the GD at [32]) that the cl 10 proviso was “to remove any doubt about whether the liberty to compete included the liberty to divert patients from CLAM and MPC”. Instead, we find that since the first sentence of cl 10 does not give rise to any doubt as to whether the clause permitted active diversion, the cl 10 proviso cannot be construed to confer on the parties a contractual right to disregard their existing responsibilities and obligations to CLAM and hence a licence to actively harm CLAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Judge held (the GD at [33]) that a finding that cl 10 permitted active diversion would not render cl 7 meaningless because “[cl 7] continued to apply where patients chose to continue to be treated at Orchard Clinic”, whereupon Dr Goh PK was obliged to attend to them. The Judge (the GD at [35]) added that cl 10 permitted active diversion because the defendants “must have understood that [cl 10] could affect the potential sale of [the Companies]”. With respect, we disagree. Such a construction does not sit well with the plain language of cl 7 which required the doctors “to continue with and fulfil their <span class="font-italic">full responsibilities</span>, arrangements and operations” [emphasis added]. In addition, confining to this narrow meaning would in effect render cl 7 otiose because if the patients insisted on being treated at the Orchard Clinic, there would be no need for an express clause to state that the services would have to be provided there. Finally, it is one thing to say that competition might affect the sale or even the value of the Companies and another to say that the parties were expressly permitted to employ <span class="font-italic">deliberate steps</span> to strip the Companies of their core business, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the patients, which would invariably destroy the value of the Companies and in turn defeat the underlying purpose of the Agreement to sell the Companies as going concerns. The latter interpretation requires clear words to arrive at that construction. The cl 10 proviso does not come close to achieving that outcome. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In summary, the analysis of the text and context of the Agreement alone demonstrate definitively that cl 10 did not permit active diversion. However, since both parties have made extensive submissions on the parties’ subsequent conduct and their subjective understanding of the Agreement in aid of their respective cases, we should explain why we did not find them relevant or helpful in the present case. Before descending into the substance of the parties’ opposing submissions, we think it is apt to make this immediate observation. The fact that both parties rely on different aspects of subsequent conduct and the other party’s subjective understanding to support their respective <span class="font-italic">diametric</span> interpretations in itself demonstrates that the evidence is neither cogent nor unequivocal, and is thus of little or no assistance to the court in interpreting the ambit of cl 10.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relevance of the parties’ subsequent conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is common ground that after the Agreement was entered into on 14 February 2014, Dr Kelvin Goh (with Ms Jacqueline Goh’s assistance) sold Skintech products to patients at the Orchard Clinic on his assigned days.

After the first five years, a rent review was to be conducted to determine the rent payable for each of the successive five-year periods up to the end of the initial 20-year term. The parties were to endeavour to agree on the “prevailing market rental value of the [premises]”, which would represent the new rent for each rent review period, but if they failed to agree then the “prevailing market rental value of the [premises]” would be determined by a licensed valuer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The disputes over the rent reviews were resolved by the appointed valuer, who adopted the existing configuration of the leased premises as the basis for determining the prevailing market rental value. Subsequently, the tenant sought to exercise its option to renew the lease for a further 10-year term. Under the lease, in a procedure similar to that which governed the rent reviews, the parties were to endeavour to agree on the “prevailing market rental value of the [premises]” which would be the renewal rent for the option period, failing which the prevailing market rental value was to be determined by a licensed valuer. The tenant took the position that the valuation should take place on the existing configuration of the premises but the landlord contended that the valuer was permitted to posit a different and hypothetical configuration – more specifically, a configuration that would reflect the “highest and best use” of the premises. The type of configuration used would result in substantial variations in the valuation. This court was thus faced with two competing case theories <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> or<span class="font-italic"> hypothetical</span> configuration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This court, having considered the unique features of the parties’ relationship, which was more akin to that of a joint venture, coupled with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the breadth of the tenant’s wide discretion to decide on the configuration of the premises, found (at [103]) that the application of a <span class="font-italic">hypothetical</span> configuration to yield “the highest and best possible use” of the premises would be inconsistent with the nature of the parties’ agreement. Having ruled out the landlord’s <span class="font-italic">hypothetical</span> configuration, this court was left to consider whether the “prevailing market rental value” for the purposes of the lease renewal should be determined based on the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> configuration. In this connection, this court then referred to the parties’ subsequent conduct in relation to the valuations which were carried out for the second and third rent reviews. It is important to note that the subsequent conduct was relied upon because this court found that the landlord’s failure to object to the prior and consistent usage of the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> configuration by the valuer was “<span class="font-italic">cogent</span> evidence that the application of such a configuration for the purposes of valuation is entirely in line with the parties’ agreement” [emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at the time when the lease was concluded (at [103]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present case, the subsequent conduct relied on by both parties does not shed any light on the parties’ agreement as to the nature of diversion permitted under cl 10 <span class="font-italic">at the time </span><span class="font-italic">when</span> <span class="font-italic">the Agreement</span><span class="font-italic"> was signed</span>. The parties have sought to cherry-pick aspects of subsequent conduct that bolstered their respective cases as if they were unconnected events, but the parties’ subsequent conduct are in fact inter-related: Dr Kelvin Goh and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s involvement in Skintech led to the execution of the Declaration and the Letter. Once the subsequent conduct is analysed holistically, it will be apparent that it does not form cogent evidence of the parties’ intention as regards the nature of the permitted diversion under cl 10 at the time when the Agreement was concluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Contrary to the defendants’ submissions, Dr Kelvin Goh and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s involvement with Skintech cannot be said to be cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement that cl 10 permitted active diversion. To begin with, the contents of the Letter pointed to the contrary. The Letter (as quoted above in part at [49]) suggests that Dr Goh PK and Mdm Wong were at that point in time opposed to Dr Kelvin Goh and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s involvement with Skintech because, in their view, the Agreement did not permit actions which would jeopardise the agreed sale of the Companies at a minimum sum of $6m (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as going concerns). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Additionally, on the evidence before us, it is not clear to us that Dr Kelvin Goh’s and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s involvement with Skintech amounted to active diversion. It should be noted that what we must decide, for the purposes of the Diversion Claims, is not whether the offering of Skintech products was <span class="font-italic">in fact and in law</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as a matter of the Agreement’s construction) an active diversion. Rather, the relevant question is whether the offering of Skintech products was so clearly an active diversion that the parties’ acceptance of it (if there was such acceptance) <span class="font-italic">showed</span><span class="font-italic"> that active diversion was, in the first place, understood to be permissible</span>. On that note, the defendants submit that the question should be answered in the affirmative, because Dr Kelvin Goh’s “very act of offering patients [Skintech] products amounted to active diversion”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 We find this to be, at the least, far from clear. As discussed above at [32], active diversion refers to the promoting or selling of a competing product or service in preference to those of the Orchard Clinic. Arguably, Dr Kelvin Goh’s act of <span class="font-italic">offering</span> Skintech products did not, on its own, amount to him selling Skintech products in <span class="font-italic">preference </span>to the Orchard Clinic’s products. Patients appear to have had a free choice between Skintech products and Orchard Clinic’s products; they were informed about Skintech products, but not pressured to choose them over Orchard Clinic’s products. Even if it could be said that Dr Kelvin Goh <span class="font-italic">actively</span> offered the Skintech products knowing that <span class="font-italic">some</span> patients would choose them over Orchard Clinic products, it does not follow that <span class="font-italic">active diversion</span><span class="font-italic"> had been agreed to be acceptable</span>. It could just as plausibly show that active diversion was unacceptable, but that the parties did not consider the offering of Skintech products, in those circumstances, to<span class="font-italic"> cross the threshold of active diversion</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Moreover, even if it could be said that the parties accepted that the offering of Skintech products did not cross the threshold of active diversion, that would still not assist the defendants. In contrast to the offering of Skintech products, Dr Goh PK’s conduct was an <span class="font-italic">obvious and blatant</span> example of diverting patients from the Orchard Clinic (and the defendants did not contend otherwise). As Dr Goh PK himself accepted, when he was at GPK Clinic on his assigned days, patients who went to the Orchard Clinic were left with the choice of <span class="font-italic">waiting</span> at the Orchard Clinic to see him, or going over to GPK Clinic and seeing him <span class="font-italic">immediately</span>.

</div> Any sensible patient who valued his or her time would choose the latter course. Thus, Dr Goh PK’s actions all but compelled his patients to divert their business to GPK Clinic, and the comparison to Dr Kelvin Goh’s and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s involvement with Skintech is of no assistance to the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59   It also could not be said that the Letter provides cogent evidence of the parties’ agreement that cl 10 did not permit active diversion. This is because there was no response from Dr Kelvin Goh and Ms Jacqueline Goh indicating that they accepted the correctness of the Letter which they now purport to rely on. Bearing in mind the acrimonious context under which the Letter (which was essentially a letter of demand) was sent, we find it difficult to draw any inference from their silence that there was such an agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We do not find the Declaration relevant to the interpretation of cl 10 either. Dr Goh PK’s statement in the Declaration that he and Dr Kelvin Goh shall continue to work together until the Companies are sold was in substance not dissimilar to cl 7, and simply raises the question as to the precise <span class="font-italic">manner </span>in which the doctors are to continue to work together.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  Finally – and this point cuts across the Skintech issue, the Letter, and the Declaration – the subsequent conduct cited by both sides merely reflected the parties’ positions <span class="font-italic">after </span>the dispute arose to advance their respective interests. There is nothing in it which can be referred, in concrete and specific ways, to the understanding between the parties at the time the Agreement was formed. Consequently, the reference to subsequent conduct is neither necessary nor helpful. In any event, as discussed above at [33]–[46], the purpose and ambit of the Agreement (in particular cll 7 and 10) can be objectively ascertained from the express language of the Agreement alone, without resorting to subsequent conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The significance of the parties’ understanding of the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the GD, the Judge referred to the oral evidence given by Dr Kelvin Goh and Dr Goh PK during the trial in connection with their subjective understanding of cl 10 to support his interpretation that cl 10 permitted the parties to divert patients from the Companies. The relevant evidence was summarised by the Judge, as follows (the GD at [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) [Dr Kelvin Goh] himself agreed that the word “diversion” in Clause 10 referred to the case where a doctor took steps to ask the patient to go to his new clinic and that the purpose of Clause 10 was to prevent any disputes over diversion in such cases.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Both [Dr Kelvin Goh] and [Ms Jacqueline Goh] testified that Clause 10 permitted them to sell Skintech products to patients at Orchard Clinic. Initially, both took the position that by offering to sell Skintech products at Orchard Clinic, they did not compete with the latter and they were just offering patients a wider range of products to choose from. However, their explanation that Skintech products gave patients a wider choice only served to confirm that Skintech products <span class="font-italic">did</span> compete with those sold by Orchard Clinic. [Dr Kelvin Goh] had to admit on the stand that if a patient chose to buy Skintech products, that would result in a loss of income to Orchard Clinic. It must have been clear to [Dr Kelvin Goh] and [Ms Jacqueline Goh] that selling Skintech products to patients at Orchard Clinic was tantamount to diverting those patients away from Orchard Clinic, at least where the purchase of products was concerned. Nevertheless, they were of the view that Clause 10 permitted them to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 On appeal, the defendants maintain their reliance on Dr Kelvin Goh’s and Ms Jacqueline Goh’s oral testimonies.

As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Autocom Enterprise Pte Ltd v Chia Wah Siang </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 73 at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It has long been established that in construing contractual provisions, the court takes an objective view based on the language used and is not guided by the subjective understanding of either party unless there is clear evidence that the agreement was to be interpreted in accordance with a particular subjective intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Furthermore, insofar as the parties’ testimony on their understanding of the Agreement is based on their subjective intentions when entering into the contract, it is settled law that such evidence will only be admissible where there was ambiguity in the contract which could not be resolved by reference to the surrounding circumstances of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 More generally, this court in <span class="font-italic">OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua </span><span class="font-italic">Choon </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1206 (“<span class="font-italic">OCBC</span>”) (at [41]) also cautioned against reliance on oral testimonies under cross-examination to aid in the interpretation of the terms of a written contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41  Much emphasis was placed (especially by the Respondent) on the oral testimony given by various witnesses in the court below. Unfortunately, very little of the testimony relied upon by the Respondent was in fact helpful, being neutral at best and either irrelevant or ambiguous at worst. It bears mention that the first port of call for any court in determining the existence of an alleged contract and/or its terms would be the relevant documentary evidence. <span class="font-italic">Where (as in the present case) the issue is whether or not a binding contract exists between the parties, a contemporaneous written record of the evidence is obviously more reliable than a witness’s oral testimony given well after the fact, recollecting what has transpired.</span> <span class="font-italic">Such evidence may be coloured by the onset of subsequent events and the very factual dispute between the </span><span class="font-italic">parties.</span> In this regard, <span class="font-italic">subjective statements of witnesses alone are, in the nature of things, often unhelpful</span>. ... This is not to state that oral testimony should, ipso facto, be discounted. On the contrary, credible oral testimony can be helpful to the court, especially where (as we shall see below in relation to supporting the Appellant’s case) such testimony is given for the purpose of clarifying the existing documentary evidence. There is, however, no magic formula in determining the appropriate weight that should be given to witness testimony. Much would depend on the precise factual matrix before the court. However, it bears reiterating that the court would always look first to the most reliable and objective evidence as to whether or not a binding contract was entered into between the parties and such evidence would tend to be documentary in nature. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We acknowledge that evidence adduced from witnesses under cross-examination may shed light in situations where the parties’ agreement has not been expressed in the written text. In <span class="font-italic">OCBC</span>, the dispute concerned the very existence of a binding oral contract. This court considered the oral evidence of the party who denied the existence of a contract to be useful, as he gave evidence to the effect that he was “wholly in agreement with the terms set out in the [term sheet]” [emphasis omitted] (at [47]). Here, apart from the obvious judicial reluctance to refer to the parties’ subjective understanding as an aid for contractual interpretation, the dispute concerns the express wording of cl 10 read with cl 7 which we find clearly did not permit active diversion. In any event, we do not consider the parties’ oral evidence to be useful for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in relation to Dr Kelvin Goh’s evidence, we consider his evidence to have been coloured by the onset of subsequent events, in particular, his involvement with Skintech. We note that his apparent concession that Dr Goh PK was entitled under cl 10 to see patients at GPK Clinic on his assigned days was made after he was confronted with his own involvement in Skintech, which he had justified by relying on cl 10 (see above at [62]–[63]). We do not think that the cross-examination undertaken by counsel to explore what the parties <span class="font-italic">subjectively</span> understood the terms of the Agreement to mean in order to rationalise their own conduct can be substituted for the Agreement’s <span class="font-italic">objective</span> interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the concession that Dr Goh PK was entitled to see patients at GPK Clinic on the days when he was assigned to work at the Orchard Clinic does not translate into an acknowledgment that active diversion of patients is therefore permissible under cl 10. At best, it suggests that the two doctors were permitted to work at the new clinics in addition to the Orchard Clinic on any given day. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Dr Kelvin Goh and Dr Goh PK’s oral testimonies neither disclosed a subjective understanding that formed part of a clear and obvious context to the contract, nor were they useful in clarifying the existing documentary evidence concerning the Agreement. As we have explained above at [33]–[46], we consider the interpretation of cl 10 to be clear and unambiguous in its text, and therefore the need for clarification with reference to the parties’ subjective understanding does not even arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Accordingly, we find that cl 10 did not permit Dr Goh PK to actively divert patients from the Orchard Clinic to GPK Clinic. We therefore allow the Diversion Claims against Dr Goh PK. As a consequence, we also find – on a straightforward application of the principles governing conspiracy by unlawful means, which were correctly stated (so far as is relevant to the present case) by the Judge at [48]–[49] of the GD – that GPKPL is liable for conspiracy to injure CLAM by unlawful means in relation to Dr Goh PK’s acts which formed the subject matter of the Diversion Claims. We turn now to consider Mdm Wong’s liability in relation to the Diversion Claims alongside her liability for the other claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Liability of Mdm Wong</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 CLAM brought claims against Mdm Wong in relation to both breach of confidentiality and the Diversion Claims.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Given our finding that cl 10 did not permit Dr Goh PK’s manner of diversion, it follows that Mdm Wong’s inaction was a breach of her fiduciary duties to CLAM. Mdm Wong cannot rely on Dr Goh PK’s belief that he was entitled to divert patients to justify her own inaction. In our view, their defences must stand or fall together since they have aligned themselves to each other in their reliance on the cl 10 proviso. While Mdm Wong professed not to know the details of how GPK Clinic was run, it did not require much to know the facts that constituted Dr Goh PK’s breach – she simply had to ask whether he was seeing his patients at GPK Clinic on his assigned days, or not. Thus, it is clear to us that Mdm Wong breached her fiduciary duties to CLAM in relation to the Diversion Claims and is liable for the damage thereby caused. In light of this finding, it is not necessary for us to make separate findings as to whether the corresponding claim in conspiracy is also made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 We turn now to consider the issue of damages to be awarded to CLAM. As mentioned above at [15(c)], the Judge had awarded CLAM $193,481.38 for the breach of confidentiality claim. This sum represented the profits made by GPK Clinic from the Orchard Clinic patients over a period of six months from 19 May 2014 (the date when operations commenced at GPK Clinic) to 19 November 2014. The Judge (at [54]–[55]) considered it “fair and reasonable” to limit the computation period to six months because he recognised that Dr Goh PK would have been able to divert the patients even without misusing the confidential information; such information merely <span class="font-italic">accelerated</span> the diversion of patients. Damages was computed by the parties using the following parameters provided by the Judge, who had in turn adopted the method of computation proposed by the defendants’ expert, subject to the following modifications  (the GD at [61(a)–(c)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) An Orchard Clinic patient was someone who was already registered as a patient of Orchard Clinic when [Dr] Goh PK copied the Clinic Information on 25 April 2014. Those who became patients of Orchard Clinic after 25 April 2014 would be excluded since the Clinic Information that [Dr] Goh PK copied would not have included their information. If any such patient subsequently became a patient of GPK Clinic, that would not have been caused by the breach of confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Profits earned by GPK Clinic from Orchard Clinic patients were to include all products sold to the patients at GPK Clinic.

CLAM acknowledges this shortcoming but suggests that it may be addressed by applying a percentage reduction of Mr Temple-Cole’s projections to take into account the effects of legitimate competition.

</div> However, no expert evidence was adduced to provide any basis to derive the appropriate percentage reduction. Indeed, as CLAM’s counsel, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC, conceded during the oral hearing before us, this is an “extremely difficult exercise” because the court would have to “anticipate what would happen and that is by necessity speculative”. Accordingly, we decline to adopt CLAM’s proposal, and hold that the Judge’s method of computation is more appropriate, subject to the observations that we make below at [89]–[91].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We turn now to the issue of the relevant period of loss.

</div>
</div>
</div> While there was indeed no such express requirement for the renewal of the Orchard Clinic’s lease, Mdm Wong and Dr Goh PK were still obliged under cl 7 to “duly continue with and fulfil their full responsibilities, arrangements and operations of the [Clinics]”. We consider this clause to oblige parties to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, take steps to enable the existing arrangements and operations of the Clinics to continue until the sale of the Companies. In this context, we find that Mdm Wong and Dr Goh PK’s withholding of consent for the renewal of the lease was a breach of cl 7 of the Agreement. As Dr Goh PK himself accepted, “the renewal of the lease [was] necessary for CLAM to continue as a going concern”.

</div>
</div>
</div> In other words, if the lease was not renewed, the Orchard Clinic could not operate and all existing arrangements would have to come to an end. Thus, by withholding their consent to the renewal of the lease, Mdm Wong and Dr Goh PK breached their duty under cl 7 to “continue with … arrangements and operations of [the Clinics]”. Mdm Wong and Dr Goh PK should not be allowed to benefit from their breach of cl 7. CLAM’s loss should thus be calculated up to the period of 31 December 2016, notwithstanding the Orchard Clinic’s cessation of operations on 31 March 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The period for computing the loss in respect of the Diversion Claims should commence from 20 November 2014 because CLAM has already been awarded the sum of $193,481.38 for breach of confidentiality for the period from 19 May 2014 to 19 November 2014. To compute the loss from the date GPK Clinic commenced operations (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>19 May 2014) as contended by CLAM would entail double recovery over the overlapping period. Thus, we are minded to award CLAM damages for the Diversion Claims to be computed using the Judge’s method of computation, for the period from 20 November 2014 to 31 December 2016. We observe that the Judge’s method of computation of CLAM’s losses included the profits earned by GPKPL from all the Orchard Clinic patients treated at GPK Clinic <span class="font-italic">regardless of the day in the week that the </span><span class="font-italic">patients saw Dr Goh PK at GPK Clinic</span> (the GD at [60]). This differed from the method proposed by the defendants’ expert, which only computed profits earned from the Orchard Clinic patients who <span class="font-italic">visit</span><span class="font-italic">ed GPK Clinic on Dr Goh PK’s assigned days at the Orchard Clinic</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We are of the view that this method of computation must be modified for the purposes of computing losses for the Diversion Claims, which stretches over a period of around two years and one month. In such circumstances, if we are to adopt the Judge’s method of computation for the Diversion Claims, we will be making an unrealistic assumption that GPK Clinic would not be able to legitimately attract any of the Orchard Clinic patients at all for the entire period prior to 31 December 2016. The effect of legitimate competition is not negligible, given that GPK Clinic was only two units away from the Orchard Clinic, and CLAM accepts that “if Orchard Clinic patients who preferred to see Dr Goh PK over Dr Kelvin Goh wanted to see him on a non-assigned day, and therefore went to GPK Clinic”, this would be considered legitimate competition.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Therefore, to take into account the likelihood that through legitimate competition, Dr Goh PK would likely have been able to attract some of the Orchard Clinic patients to visit him at GPK Clinic (without active diversion) on his non-assigned days, we consider it more realistic to compute damages on the basis of profits made from the Orchard Clinic patients who visited GPK Clinic on Dr Goh PK’s assigned days <span class="font-italic">only</span>. In effect, we are applying a discount to take into account legitimate competition. This is in line with CLAM’s submission that some percentage reduction ought to be factored into the assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Accordingly we find the defendants liable to CLAM for the damages in respect of the Diversion Claims to be computed using the Judge’s method of computation, as modified above at [91] for the period from 20 November 2014 to 31 December 2016. The defendants are to provide the relevant records of GPK Clinic for this purpose, if not already provided. Parties are to work out the amount of damages based on the above parameters, failing which the matter is to be remitted to the Judge for his assessment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Percentage of costs and disbursements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We turn now to the issue of costs and disbursements. The Judge awarded CLAM 40% of costs below as the Judge had dismissed most of the claims against Dr Goh PK and GPKPL (save for the claim for breach of confidentiality and conspiracy) and dismissed the claims against Mdm Wong altogether. CLAM submits that the costs should be increased to 80% should it succeed on its appeal.

Nevertheless, we are of the view that CLAM is in substance the successful party and award CLAM 80% of the costs of the trial below as claimed.

</div> In our view, the fact that an expert’s views were ultimately not accepted in full by the court does not mean that the costs of engaging the expert was unreasonably incurred. The Judge, who had the full benefit of hearing Mr Temple-Cole’s testimony, found his costs to be reasonably incurred, and we see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reimbursement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The defendants argue that the Judge erred in ordering that the party and party costs awarded to CLAM be used to satisfy CLAM’s outstanding obligations for the solicitor and client costs, and that any balance thereafter be used to reimburse Dr Kelvin Goh for any fees that he had paid on behalf of CLAM (“the reimbursement order”).

</div> They make two arguments in this regard. First, the defendants argue that there was no evidence that Dr Kelvin Goh had paid the solicitor and client costs of CLAM in Suit 672/2015.

</div>
</div>
</div> In our view, neither submission has any merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 We find the first argument to be overly technical and contrary to common sense. The irresistible inference on the facts is that Dr Kelvin Goh must have paid for CLAM’s legal fees in Suit 672/2015: it is clear that neither CLAM nor the defendants paid for such costs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In fact, during the oral arguments, the defendants’ counsel, Mr Pereira George Barnabas, clarified that he was not suggesting that Dr Kelvin Goh did not pay for such costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The second argument assumes that Dr Kelvin Goh needs to have an independent legal entitlement to reimbursement of the costs which he incurred for CLAM, before the Judge may make the reimbursement order. This is contrary to the established principle that the court’s discretion on costs extends to the award of costs in favour of non-parties (<span class="font-italic">DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2010] 3 SLR 542 at [22]–[23]). In other words, it was within the Judge’s discretion to award costs to Dr Kelvin Goh even if Dr Kelvin Goh had no other legal entitlement to such costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 We also find that the Judge’s discretion was properly exercised. Since CLAM did not pay for the solicitor and client costs in the first place, there was no reason for it to benefit from the costs order, which was meant “to reimburse CLAM, at least partially, for its solicitor and client costs” (the GD at [72]). Therefore, after costs awarded to CLAM were used to satisfy CLAM’s outstanding obligations for the solicitor and client costs, the balance should be used to reimburse the party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Dr Kelvin Goh) who had paid (and would pay) for CLAM’s solicitor and client costs. To hold otherwise would be to grant CLAM an unjustified windfall. The defendants’ appeal against the reimbursement order is therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For the reasons given above, we allow CA 160/2016 in part and dismiss CA 47/2017 in the entirety. Our decision, in summary, is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  We find Dr Goh PK liable for breach of fiduciary duties in relation to the Diversion Claims.
