<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The late Mr Quek Kiat Siong (“the
                    deceased”) generously bequeathed his substantial estate comprising
                    several properties to his siblings and their children. Unfortunately, after his
                    death, various disputes over the bequests he had made arose among the
                    beneficiaries and these resulted in a number of law suits. Subsequently, the
                    various parties were persuaded to go for mediation. This process was successful
                    and on 21 March 3013 a Settlement Agreement (“the Settlement
                    Agreement”), which ostensibly resolved all the difficulties, was signed
                    by six parties including the present plaintiffs and defendant. However, later
                    there were problems in implementing some of the provisions of the Settlement
                    Agreement and these problems led to the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This dispute involved three of the
                    deceased’s beneficiaries: his sister, the first plaintiff; his brother,
                    the defendant; and his nephew, the second plaintiff. The plaintiffs are also the
                    executors of the deceased’s estate (“the
                Estate”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The dispute concerned three properties belonging
                    to the Estate, to wit:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     95 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 427389
                        (“95 Joo Chiat”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     97 Joo Chiat Road, Singapore 427391 (“97 Joo
                        Chiat”) (“collectively, the Joo Chiat properties”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     18 Tembeling
                        Lane, Singapore 423486 (“18 Tembeling
                    Lane”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These properties were dealt
                        with in the Settlement Agreement as well and the plaintiffs’ position
                        in these proceedings was that the defendant had undertaken certain
                        obligations in the Settlement Agreement in relation to the properties which
                        he had failed to fulfil. The proceedings were started to compel the
                        defendant to perform those obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Clause 4 of the Settlement Agreement dealt with
                    18 Tembeling Lane. It provided for the defendant, who was occupying the property
                    with his family, to make certain payments in respect of utilities, mortgage
                    instalments and property tax falling due in respect of 18 Tembeling Lane. It
                    also provided that the property was to be sold in the open market no later than
                    five years from the date of the Settlement Agreement. The plaintiffs,
                    complaining that the defendant had failed to make the payments required by the
                    clause, asked me to order an immediate sale of 18 Tembeling Lane. The defendant
                    objected on various grounds. I declined to order an immediate sale but made
                    orders for payment of half of the mortgage instalments by the defendant on the
                    basis that if at any time he was in arrears of two months’ payments, the
                    plaintiffs would then be at liberty to sell 18 Tembeling Lane in the open
                    market. There has been no appeal against these orders and I therefore will say
                    no more in these grounds about the circumstances and reasons for the orders
                    affecting 18 Tembeling Lane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In respect of the Joo Chiat properties, the
                    first plaintiff sought specific performance of the defendant’s obligations
                    under the Settlement Agreement. She wanted an order that he should sell his
                    one-sixth shares in each of the Joo Chiat properties to her as he had
                    agreed to in cl 5 of the Settlement Agreement. After hearing the parties, I made
                    the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Order 1: The defendant is to do all
                        such acts and execute all such documents as may be necessary to sell his
                        one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties to the first plaintiff, at the
                        price of $700,000, within 21 days from 20 February 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Order 2: The defendant is to pay the
                        first plaintiff $1,016.50 for the defendant’s half share of Knight
                        Frank’s professional fees for performing a valuation of the Joo Chiat
                        properties within 21 days from 20 February 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendant has appealed against those orders.
                    His complaint is that the price of $700,000 is too low as it was based on a
                    valuation report which did not reflect the true market value of the Joo Chiat
                    properties. The valuation report in question was issued by Knight Frank Pte Ltd
                    (“Knight Frank”) pursuant to cl 5 of the Settlement Agreement
                    which nominated Knight Frank as the independent valuer to determine the market
                    value of the Joo Chiat properties. The main issue that I had to decide was
                    whether, on the true construction of cl 5, the valuation issued by Knight Frank
                    was final and binding on the defendant. The subsidiary issue was whether this
                    was a proper case for the remedy of specific performance to be
                applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Settlement Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Settlement Agreement was intended to be a
                    full and final settlement of all the disputes between the beneficiaries of the
                    Estate including the plaintiffs and the defendant. Evidence of their intention
                    to achieve such full and final settlement can be found in cl 6 of the Settlement
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    This Settlement Agreement is in <em>full and final settlement</em> of all and/or any claims,

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events leading to these proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Pursuant to cl 5, the defendant’s former
                    solicitor wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 24 April 2013, indicating
                    that the defendant was ready to sell his shares in the Joo Chiat properties and
                    if the first plaintiff was ready to buy them, he would proceed to initiate the
                    valuation process for both properties by engaging Knight Frank. The valuation
                    fees were to be split equally between them. Knight Frank was appointed by the
                    first plaintiff on 25 April 2013. The first plaintiff funded its full fee
                    initially and on 30 April 2013, the defendant was informed about these
                    developments and that the first plaintiff was agreeable to splitting the
                    professional fees equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On completion of Knight Frank’s
                    valuation on 8 May 2013, the Joo Chiat properties were collectively valued at
                    $4.2m. Knight Frank’s valuation report (“Knight Frank’s
                    Valuation”) was sent to the defendant’s solicitor and the first
                    plaintiff stated that she would pay the defendant $700,000, being one-sixth of
                    the collective value of the Joo Chiat properties. However, the defendant’s
                    solicitor replied on 19 June 2013 that the $4.2m figure was “too far off
                    the average market valuation of similar properties in the same area” and
                    that there was “a great discrepancy” between the valuation of the
                    properties done by Knight Frank and that done by another firm of valuers, GSK
                    Global. As proof of this, the defendant produced a valuation report by GSK
                    Global dated 3 June 2013 (“the GSK Report”) which valued the Joo
                    Chiat properties at $7.5m. He also sent the first plaintiff a transfer document
                    and title search report of a property at 370 Joo Chiat Road (collectively,
                    “the 370 Joo Chiat documents”). On the same day, the
                    defendant’s solicitor also wrote to Knight Frank to ask for a
                    re-assessment of its valuation of the Joo Chiat properties, enclosing the 370
                    Joo Chiat documents in his request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Knight Frank responded on 27 June 2013,
                    highlighting the key differences between its valuation and the GSK Report and
                    explaining why its valuation was fair, reasonable and informed. The defendant
                    was also told that there was no basis for a review of the $4.2m valuation. On 9
                    July 2013, this information was again conveyed to the defendant and he was
                    informed that the first plaintiff would be making a payment of $700,000 to him
                    for his shares in the Joo Chiat properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant replied on 20 August 2013
                    stating that he was not accepting the $4.2m valuation given by Knight Frank as
                    it was an unreasonably low figure. In response, on 30 August 2013, the first
                    plaintiff asserted that the defendant had no basis to refuse the transfer of his
                    shares in the Joo Chiat properties to the first plaintiff and if he did not
                    confirm that the necessary transfer documents would be executed by 6 September
                    2013, she would commence proceedings to compel performance of his obligations
                    under the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant later changed solicitors and on
                    23 September 2013, the first plaintiff was sent valuation reports done by DTZ
                    Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd (“DTZ”) dated 15 July 2013 and
                    Jones Lang Laselle Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“JLL”) dated 23
                    July 2013. As the average of the market prices contained in the GSK, DTZ and JLL
                    reports was $7m for both the Joo Chiat properties, the first plaintiff was asked
                    to increase the purchase price for the defendant’s one-sixth shares in the
                    two properties to $1,166,220, being one-sixth of $7m. The first plaintiff
                    refused on the basis that the defendant had agreed to Knight Frank valuing the
                    Joo Chiat properties and hence, its valuation was final and binding. She also
                    stated that Knight Frank’s appointment went towards fulfilling the
                    parties’ wishes to avoid further dispute over the valuer’s identity
                    and the valuation of the Joo Chiat properties. The fact that there might be
                    differing valuations was inconsequential to the final and binding nature of
                    Knight Frank’s Valuation. Therefore, the defendant’s continued
                    refusal to sell his one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties constituted a
                    breach of the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thereafter, the plaintiffs commenced these
                    proceedings to, <em>inter alia</em>, compel the defendant
                    to sell his share in the Joo Chiat properties to the first
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The main issue to be considered was whether
                    the defendant was bound to accept Knight Frank’s Valuation as final and
                    binding. The subsidiary issue was whether in that case it would be correct to
                    order the defendant to complete the sale. I will take the issues in
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was Knight Frank’s Valuation final and binding?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiffs submitted that Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation was final and binding. While the words “final and
                    binding” did not appear in the Settlement Agreement, the courts usually
                    implied such terms where the parties had agreed on an expert to determine the
                    price of a property: <em>Campbell v Edwards</em> [1976] 1
                    WLR 403 (“<em>Campbell</em>”), <em>Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 (“<em>Evergreat</em>”) at [27] and <em>Tan Yeow Khoon
                        v Tan Yeow Tat</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 486 at [12]. Even though there
                    were differences between the valuations given by Knight Frank, GSK, DTZ and JLL,
                    this was an insufficient reason for saying that Knight Frank’s Valuation
                    was manifestly erroneous as held in <em>Riduan bin Yusof v Khng
                        Thian Huat</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 188 <em>(“Riduan”)</em> at [35] or that it was procured by fraud as held in
                        <em>Evergreat</em> at [26]–[29]. Additionally,
                    Knight Frank had provided cogent reasons for its valuation and as such, there
                    was no basis to disregard it and the same should be upheld: see <em>Campbell</em> at 408.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The Joo Chiat properties must be sold at market value</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant submitted that cl 5 states that
                    he was to sell his one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties to the first
                    plaintiff “at market value”. It would not be just or equitable to
                    force him to sell his shares below the market value as that would be against the
                    terms of the Settlement Agreement. Furthermore, Knight Frank’s Valuation
                    was not exclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, cl 5 was premised on an implied term
                    that Knight Frank’s Valuation would be at market value and/or fair or
                    reasonable. As the owner of his share of the Joo Chiat properties, he was
                    entitled to ascertain the true “market value” of the properties or
                    ensure that Knight Frank’s Valuation was fair and reasonable. Since the
                    difference in valuation between Knight Frank and the average obtained from the
                    valuations of DTZ, JLL and GSK was substantial, the first plaintiff had to
                    increase the price for her purchase of his one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat
                    properties. This would not just benefit him but also the five other co-owners of
                    the Joo Chiat properties. The defendant also alleged that the plaintiffs lacked
                    good faith by insisting on valuing the Joo Chiat properties at a lower
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Knight Frank’s Valuation was not final and binding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Next, the defendant submitted that Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation could not be final and binding on the parties because
                    those words did not appear in cl 5. He referred to a few cases to emphasise the
                    significance of the words when they were used. In <em>McDonald’s Rest Restaurants Pte Ltd v Wisma Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2001] SGHC 375 at [11], the words “final conclusive
                    and binding” had been used in the relevant clause and the court had held
                    that the valuation in that case could not be disturbed. A similar clause was
                    also found in <em>Holland Leedon Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v
                        Metalform Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 517 at [5] which provided for
                    the binding nature of the arbitral award. Lastly, <em>Poh Cheng
                        Chew v K P Poh &amp; Partners Pte Ltd</em> [2014] SGHC 20
                        (“<em>Poh Cheng Chew</em>”) was cited for
                    the point that in the absence of the words “solely” or
                    “only”, the court should not imply terms into a contract such that
                    the expert determinator’s scope of discretion would be fettered. The
                    defendant’s point was that if Knight’s Valuation was to be final and
                    binding, this must be explicitly stated in the Settlement
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Here, even though the Settlement Agreement did
                    not provide for a second valuation to be obtained or for such a report to be
                    considered, it also did not provide that no other valuation was to be considered
                    or that Knight Frank’s Valuation should be final and/or binding. The
                    Settlement Agreement was drafted by the plaintiffs’ solicitors and the
                    plaintiffs were legally represented and fully advised. However, the plaintiffs
                    neither chose to stipulate that Knight Frank’s Valuation was final and
                    binding nor chose to preclude the valuation from being the subject of any
                    dispute, review or appeal. Therefore, Knight Frank’s Valuation could not
                    be final and binding on the parties especially given their acrimonious and
                    litigious history.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant therefore submitted that the
                    present case was similar to <em>Poh Cheng Chew</em>, and
                    the parties’ intentions were for a fair and neutral evaluation to be
                    obtained. In addition, three other reports were presented from reputable valuers
                    determining the market value to be higher than that given by Knight Frank. In
                    such a case, the court should exercise its power to disregard Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation in favour of an alternative valuation
                method.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision: Knight Frank’s Valuation was final and
                binding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first issue that I had to consider in
                    respect of the Joo Chiat properties was whether Knight Frank’s Valuation
                    was final and binding despite the absence of the words “final” and
                    “binding” from cl 5. The plaintiffs submitted that this had to be
                    the meaning of the clause given that the parties entered into the Settlement
                    Agreement with a view to achieving a clean break and preventing future
                    litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The question here is as to the true meaning of
                    cl 5. Although it did not contain the words “final and binding”, I
                    agree with the plaintiffs’ submission that it was the parties’
                    intention that this would be the effect of the valuation done by Knight Frank. I
                    come to this conclusion by an analysis of the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first thing that the first plaintiff and
                    the defendant had to agree on was the price for the Joo Chiat properties. They
                    did not agree to a specific price but instead accepted a formula: the sale was
                    to be at “market price”. This was specifically stated in the
                    clause. There was no gap or ambiguity in this part of the provision and
                    therefore no room for any implication that the price would be “fair and
                    reasonable” as the defendant argued or that the “market
                    price” would be a price either party considered to be fair and
                    reasonable. Having agreed on the formula, the question that next arose was how
                    “market price” was to be determined. The parties’ answer to
                    this was to agree on an independent valuer. They then went on to name the party
                    who would be that valuer and they agreed on a valuer who is well known and well
                    respected in the Singapore property market. There was nothing bizarre in the
                    choice that could lead to any ambiguity or any implication that the valuation
                    obtained would have to be supplemented in any way. Having decided that, the
                    clause provided for “the valuation to be determined by Knight Frank, an
                    independent valuer”. No other or additional name was provided. It could
                    have been, but was not, agreed that the “market price” would be
                    determined by the average of two or even three valuers’ reports. That that
                    was not done indicates it was the parties’ intention, for simplicity and
                    cost effectiveness, to use one valuer. The defendant’s point that the
                    Settlement Agreement was drafted by the plaintiffs’ solicitors was
                    immaterial. The defendant was legally represented and, equally, could have
                    insisted that more than one valuer be appointed. He did not have to agree to
                    just one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my judgment, the words
                    “final” and “binding” did not have to be implied
                    into cl 5 for it to be effective – the intention of the parties for Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation to be final and binding was plain despite the absence of
                    those specific words. The context of the Settlement Agreement was clear: parties
                    wanted to settle all existing disputes (which included disputes arising from the
                    defendant’s co-ownership of the Joo Chiat properties) and they wanted to
                    settle them once and for all. They wanted to be free of court disputes and did
                    not want to have to go back to court to resolve their issues. Clause 6 of the
                    Settlement Agreement expressed this intention and though it did not specifically
                    refer to the valuation to be carried out under cl 5, the same intention must
                    have informed the wording of that clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I found the defendant’s submission that
                    cl 5 could not be final and binding in light of the acrimonious and litigious
                    relationship between the parties to be spurious. In fact, it was precisely
                    because their relationship was acrimonious and litigious that they sought to
                    resolve the matter amicably through mediation. They achieved this aim when the
                    Settlement Agreement was concluded. I was satisfied that cl 5 meant that Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation was final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Next, the defendant contended that there was
                    an implied term that Knight Frank’s Valuation was to reflect the market
                    value of the Joo Chiat properties. The significant difference between Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation and the average valuation price obtained by averaging
                    the figures given by GSK, JLL and DTZ showed that Knight Frank’s Valuation
                    was below the market value and it would be unjust and inequitable for defendant
                    to sell his share of the Joo Chiat properties at the price derived from this
                    valuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I found the defendant’s arguments
                    unmeritorious. The clause provided for the market value to be determined by
                    Knight Frank: that is, the market value would be what Knight Frank said it was.
                    As I discuss below at [33], in such a situation, the determination cannot be
                    challenged except on the grounds of fraud, collusion or manifest error on the
                    face of the valuation. None of these factors was present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was also material that at the outset, the
                    defendant did not dispute the validity of Knight Frank’s appointment and
                    even agreed to bear half of the professional costs incurred. Before me he sought
                    to say that Knight Frank’s Valuation should not be relied on because it
                    was below the market price which he considered to be the average of the three
                    valuations given by the valuers he appointed. However, it is clear that a
                    difference between the price arrived at by the contractually nominated valuer
                    and those arrived at by other parties is insufficient to show that Knight
                    Frank’s Valuation should not be relied upon. In their submissions, the
                    plaintiffs relied on <em>Campbell</em>, a case where the
                    facts were highly similar to those before me. It is thus worthwhile to examine
                    the facts in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     
          <em>Campbell</em>
                    concerned the assignment of a tenancy agreement that provided, <em>inter alia</em>, that should the tenant wish to assign the
                    premises she should first offer to surrender the lease to the landlord at a
                    price to be fixed by a chartered surveyor agreed on between them. The tenant
                    later sought to surrender her lease and agreed with the landlord to appoint the
                    firm of Chestertons as surveyors to assess the proper price to be paid for the
                    remainder of her lease. Chestertons valued the lease at £10,000, but the
                    landlord obtained two other valuations at £3,500 and £1,250
                    respectively. He then sought a declaration that he was not bound by
                    Chestertons’ valuation and asked for an order that a new valuation be
                    obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In rejecting the landlord’s arguments
                    and finding for the tenant, Lord Denning MR held (<em>Campbell</em> at 407G–H) that the parties were bound by their
                    agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If two persons agree that the price of property should be fixed by a
                        valuer on whom they agree, and he gives that valuation honestly and in good
                        faith, they are bound by it. Even if he has made a mistake they are still
                        bound by it. The reason is because they have agreed to be bound by it. If
                        there were fraud or collusion, of course, it would be very different. Fraud
                        or collusion unravels everything.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be that if a valuer gives a speaking valuation – if he gives
                        his reasons or his calculations – and you can show on the face of them
                        that they are wrong it might be upset. But this is not such a case.
                        Chestertons simply gave the figure. Having given it honestly, it is binding
                        on the parties. It is no good for either party to say it is incorrect.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     
          <em>Campbell</em> was
                    followed by V K Rajah J in <em>Evergreat</em>, a case
                    involving an independent assessor appointed to assess the respective claims of
                    the plaintiff main contractor and the defendant subcontractor. In that case, the
                    independent assessor was given liberty to determine all issues of procedure for
                    the assessment and his decisions and findings on procedure, liability and
                    quantum were to be final: <em>Evergreat</em> at [5]. The
                    assessor having rendered decisions and findings that were unfavourable to the
                    plaintiff, the plaintiff then applied to set aside his findings on the basis
                    that the assessor had failed to consider several items: <em>Evergreat</em> at [20]. However, Rajah J disallowed the application
                    and held (<em>Evergreat</em> at [28]–[29])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In <em>Baber v Kenwood Manufacturing Co Ltd and Whinney Murray
                                &amp; Co</em> [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 175 Lawton JL said at
                            181:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">They [the auditors] were to be experts. Now experts can be wrong; they
                            can be muddle-headed; and unfortunately on occasions they can give their
                            opinions negligently. Anyone who agrees to accept the opinion of an
                            expert accepts the risk of these sorts of misfortunes happening. What is
                            not acceptable is the risk of the expert being dishonest or
                            corrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    In the absence of fraud or any corrupt colouring of
                            the [Independent Assessor’s] determination, there is neither
                            liberty nor latitude to interfere with or rewrite the parties’
                            solemn and considered contractual bargain, see [5]. It is quite
                            inappropriate for a court to substitute its own view on the merits when
                            the parties have already agreed to rely on the expertise of an expert
                            for a final and irrevocable determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The only exception to the final and binding
                    nature of Knight Frank’s Valuation would be if it was arose from collusion
                    or was fraudulent or manifestly erroneous: <em>Tan Yeow Khoon v
                        Tan Yeow Tat</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 486 at [12]. This was affirmed by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Riduan</em>. Later in <em>Geowin Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Management
                        Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1256</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1004
                        (“<em>Geowin</em>”) such a situation was
                    stated at [16] to be a patent error on the face of the award or decision. In
                        <em>Geowin</em>, Rajah J cited Lord Denning MR in
                        <em>Campbell</em> and held at [17] that if a figure
                    were given honestly it would be binding on the parties <em>even
                        if incorrect</em> unless it could be shown that the reasons or
                    calculations the valuer had given for such figure were, <em>on
                        their face</em>, wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Fraud was not alleged here. The defendant was
                    left with manifest error. I did not find that Knight Frank’s Valuation was
                    manifestly erroneous or that there was a patent error on its face. Knight
                    Frank’s report was well-substantiated and sufficiently detailed to show
                    that its valuation was not an arbitrary one but a well-considered one. The mere
                    raising of differences between its valuation and the valuations given by GSK,
                    DTZ and JLL and GSK was therefore insufficient to show that Knight Frank’s
                    Valuation could not be the market value or was manifestly erroneous. The
                    valuations that the defendant relied on were done at different dates and
                    included information that was not available to Knight Frank when it did its
                    valuation. It was notable that none of the defendant’s valuers challenged
                    the methodology used by Knight Frank as being incorrect. In any event, even if
                    there had been an honest mistake in Knight Frank’s Valuation, it would
                    have still bound the parties since there was no manifest error.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">In what circumstances should specific performance be
                granted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiffs sought an order for specific
                    performance with respect to the Joo Chiat properties. This court’s power
                    to grant the remedies prayed for, which stems from para 14 of the First Schedule
                    to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 332, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“SCJA”), was undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiffs submitted that the dominant
                    principle that should operate in considering whether specific performance should
                    be granted is that specific performance will only be granted if it is just to do
                    so in light of all the circumstances: <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor
                        Peow Victor</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 (“<em>Lee
                        Chee Wei</em>”). Two important elements in this enquiry are,
                        <em>inter alia</em> (see <em>Lee Chee
                        Wei</em> at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether damages would be an adequate
                        remedy; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the person against whom specific performance is sought would suffer
                        substantial hardship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In respect of the above elements, first, the
                    plaintiffs submitted that specific performance is generally available for a
                    contract for the purchase of land as damages are inadequate because land is a
                    type of property for which there is no adequate substitute. In the present case,
                    this argument applied even more strongly because the remaining shares in the Joo
                    Chiat properties were held by family members and the object of the sale of the
                    defendant’s one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties was to achieve a
                    clean break and to avoid future disputes between the co-owners. It was thus
                    envisaged that the Joo Chiat properties were to be held by family members who
                    were able to get along with each other. The defendant had also disrupted the
                    operations of the existing family business being carried out at 95 Joo Chiat and
                    might cause further disruptions if he remained a co-owner of 95 Joo Chiat. In
                    light of these considerations, they submitted that damages would be an
                    inadequate remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Next, the plaintiffs submitted that no
                    substantial hardship would be suffered by the defendant because the defendant
                    would merely be compelled to perform obligations that he had previously agreed
                    to. The defendant objected to the performance of his obligations under the
                    Settlement Agreement on the basis that Knight Frank’s Valuation was too
                    low. However, where possible, the court should promote commercial certainty by
                    holding parties to bargains struck by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant did not take issue with the
                    plaintiffs’ submissions in relation to the remedy of specific performance
                    and the basis on which it should be issued. His dispute was only about the
                    price. He was perfectly willing to sell his one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat
                    properties to the first plaintiff provided that the price was
                right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision: Specific performance was the appropriate remedy
                here</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It was my view that specific performance
                    should be ordered in the present case. Damages were inadequate and inappropriate
                    given that the first plaintiff’s purpose in insisting that the defendant
                    transfer his one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties was not to take
                    advantage of him in order to obtain a monetary gain. The real purpose was to
                    effect a clean break between the defendant and the other co-owners of the Joo
                    Chiat properties with whom he could not agree and with whom he had already had
                    disputes. The first plaintiff and the other parties to the Settlement Agreement
                    as well as the defendant himself had agreed that it was in the interests of all
                    parties if he relinquished his shares in the Joo Chiat properties to her and had
                    nothing further to do with those properties. That was why they had agreed on a
                    mechanism for fixing the price at which she would buy him out. In those
                    circumstances, it was clear that an award of damages would not further the
                    purposes for which the Settlement Agreement came into being as no peace would be
                    achieved if the co-owners of the Joo Chiat properties did not get along with
                    each other. No other property could substitute for the interest in the Joo Chiat
                    properties that the first plaintiff would acquire from the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Next, the plaintiffs had submitted that the
                    defendant would suffer no financial hardship if the court ordered a sale of his
                    one-sixth shares in the Joo Chiat properties. I agreed. No doubt the defendant
                    would realise less from the sale than he had wanted but that sum was still a net
                    gain in financial terms and derived from the bargain he had made in relation to
                    his inheritance and not from any wrongful or unconscionable act on the part of
                    the plaintiffs. He had to abide by his bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I therefore found that it was just and
                    equitable to order a sale of the defendant’s one-sixth shares in each of
                    the Joo Chiat properties to the first plaintiff and made the orders referred to
                    in [5] above.</p>
