<p xmlns=""><u><strong><font color="#804040">GROUNDS OF DECISION</font></strong></u></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1.    In this case, the first

plaintiff, Fraser and Neave Limited (hereinafter referred to as "F &amp; N"),

the second plaintiff, Mr Michael Fam Yue Onn, the third plaintiff, Mr Tan Yam Pin, and the

fourth plaintiff, Mr Ian Alastair Maclean, alleged that they were defamed by the

defendants, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd (hereinafter referred to as

"Aberdeen") and Mr Hugh Young. As the allegedly defamatory remarks were

contained in a letter to the <i>Business Times</i> on 24 August 2000, the plaintiffs,

relying on O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, applied for a determination of the meaning

of the words used in the letter. Aberdeen and Mr Young, who were dissatisfied with the

Assistant Registrar’s construction of the words in question, appealed to the High

Court. I varied the ruling of Assistant Registrar. As Aberdeen and Mr Young have appealed

against my decision, I set out below the reasons for my decision.</font>

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">2.    The letter, which appeared

in the <i>Business Times</i> on 24 August 2000 (hereinafter referred to as "the

letter"), was re-published in the <i>Business Times </i>website. It is set out below,

with the allegedly offending words in italics.</font><b xmlns="">
<p><font size="3">        "<i>CMB Asia minorities

were kept in the dark</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></b><font size="3" xmlns="">Hot on the heels of Times Publishing, we have

  another case of minority shareholders being kept in the dark and not having sufficient

  time to consider an offer for a company. Again, the company in question, CMB Asia, is part

  of the restructuring of the Fraser and Neave group.</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">    Crown Cork of the US (already 41 per cent

  shareholder of CMB Asia) made a general offer for CMB Asia on July 22 at S$3.23, to which

  the other major shareholder, <i>Fraser and Neave, with 34 per cent, readily assented. This

  price is at a discount to a heavily written-down book value and not much above the

  company’s holding of cash in the bank.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><p>    The offer document was posted out on Aug 14 and the offer

  declared un-conditional one day later – a fait accompli.</p>
</i><p align="justify">    The independent advice to shareholders has yet

  to emerge, but institutional shareholders have been given a deadline of Aug 25 by their

  custodians to reply to the offer which expires on Sept 5. <i>This gives little time for

  independent directors of CMB Asia to consider the offer, and to communicate with the

  minority shareholders, and even less time to have an open debate.</i></p>
<p align="justify">    Once again, as in the case of Times Publishing

  (where the independent advice stating the deal to be undervaluing the company came too

  late), minority shareholders risk falling victim to an "inside job".</p>

  of boards to act equally on behalf of all shareholders, and protection of the rights of

  minority shareholders.</p>

<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">3.    F &amp; N and the other

three plaintiffs applied in SIC 1319 of 2000P to have the natural and ordinary meaning of

the allegedly defamatory words in the letter determined under O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of

Court. They pleaded that the allegedly defamatory words, in their natural and ordinary

meaning, meant and were understood to mean that they had:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="4"><p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">acted improperly and/or

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">(b) giving the minority shareholders insufficient time

  to consider the offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4.    At the hearing of the SIC on 12

January 2001, the Assistant Registrar agreed substantially with the meaning pleaded by F

&amp; N and the other plaintiffs. However, she disagreed that the words "and/or

dishonestly" should be included in her determination of the natural and ordinary

meaning of the words. Apart from this, she ruled that the offending letter also suggested

that the plaintiffs readily assented to the sale of shares to CCS at a heavily

written-down book value. Her ruling was thus as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Words, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were

  understood to mean that [F &amp; N, Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean] acted improperly by

  the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to force on the minority shareholders an inadequate

</blockquote>
<p align="center" xmlns=""><font size="3">C. THE APPEAL</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5.    As has been mentioned, Aberdeen and

Mr Young appealed against the ruling of the Assistant Registrar.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court</font>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6.    The right of a party to apply to

the court for a determination of a question of law or the construction of a document is

governed by O 14 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court, which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its own

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">7.    As for whether a plaintiff

in a defamation case may rely on O 14 r 12(1) to have the ordinary meaning of words in an

allegedly defamatory document construed, the position is not in doubt. In <i>Microsoft

Corporation &amp; Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor </i><nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 529</nobr>, 554-555

which concerned an allegation of defamation arising from a press statement, LP Thean JA,

who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said as follows:</font>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">As for the argument that the meaning of the words

  complained of is not ‘suitable for determination’ without a full trial of the

  action because such determination requires the hearing of evidence, we find that such an

  argument is completely misplaced…. There are obvious advantages in determining the

  issue of the meaning before trial, as the learned judge held at para 27.8 of his grounds

  of judgment:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">It was plain in all the circumstances that a preliminary

    determination as to the meaning of the words complained [of] if made would allow the

    defendants not only to focus on whether there was a triable issue as to their defence of

    justification of the meaning as determined but further that if there was such a triable

    issue and leave was granted to defend the action the defendants would also be focused on

    their particular defence at the subsequent trial.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns="">In our judgment, in this case, the natural and

  ordinary meaning of the alleged defamatory words is a question which is suitable for

  determination under O 14 r 12(1).</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8.    Mr Imran Khwaja, the counsel for

Aberdeen and Mr Young, contended that the present factual matrix made the application for

a construction of the allegedly defamatory words in the letter before the trial

inappropriate. He also submitted that if the letter is construed, it will be found that it

is not defamatory of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9.    At the outset, it ought to be noted

that Mr Fam, Mr Tan and Mr Maclean, unlike F &amp; N, were not specifically referred to in

the letter. I thus ruled that whether or not there is a sufficient nexus between Mr Fam,

Mr Tan and Mr Maclean and the allegedly defamatory words in the letter is a question which

should be determined at the trial. This is because extrinsic evidence would be required to

show why they were also defamed in the letter and it is clear from the decision of the

Court of Appeal in <i>Microsoft Corporation &amp; Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor </i><nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 529</nobr>, 555 that such evidence is not admissible in an application under O 14 r 12(1).

However, in the case of F &amp; N, I saw no reason why there could not be a determination

of the natural and ordinary meaning of the allegedly defamatory words in the letter.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">Principles for construing allegedly defamatory

words</font></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10.    What is meant by the term

"natural and ordinary meaning of words" was explained by Lord Reid in <i>Rubber

Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd </i>[1964] AC 234, 258 in the following succinct

terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">What the ordinary man would infer without special

  knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But

  that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two

  elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where

  the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so

  much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is

  also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">11.    The above passage was

endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Microsoft Corporation &amp; Ors</i> <i>v SM Summit

Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor </i><nobr>[1999] 4 SLR 529</nobr>, 556.</font>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">12.    The principles for

determining the natural and ordinary meaning of words are well known. In <i>Microsoft

Corporation &amp; Ors v SM Summit Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor</i>,<i> </i>LP Thean JA summed

up the position at p 555 as follows:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The court decides what meaning the words would have conveyed to an

  ordinary, reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense: <i>Jeyaretnam

  Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok Tong </i><nobr>[1984-1985] SLR 516</nobr>; …. The test is an objective

  one: it is the natural and ordinary meaning as understood by an ordinary, reasonable

  person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal. The meaning intended by the maker of

  the defamatory statement is irrelevant. Similarly, the sense in which the words were

  actually understood by the party alleged to have been defamed is also irrelevant. Nor is

  extrinsic evidence admissible in construing the words. The meaning must be gathered from

  the words themselves and in the context of the entire passage in which they are set out.

  The court is not confined to the literal or strict meaning of the words, but takes into

  account what the ordinary, reasonable person may reasonably infer from the words. The

  ordinary, reasonable person reads between the lines.</p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Whether the letter defamed F &amp; N</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13.    At the outset, it ought to be

reiterated that in an action for defamation, the plaintiff must establish that the

offending words are defamatory of him. In <i>Gatley on</i> <i>Libel and Slander,</i> 9<sup>th</sup>

ed<i>, </i>the position is stated at p 161 as follows:</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">To succeed in an action for defamation the plaintiff

  must not only prove that the defendant published the words and that they are defamatory:

  he must also identify himself as the person defamed.…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">…. The question in all cases is whether the words

  might be understood by reasonable people to refer to the plaintiff, subject to the

  qualification that where the words are published to persons who have special knowledge the

  issue will be decided by reference to what reasonable persons possessing that knowledge

  would understand by them.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">14.    Mr Khwaja submitted that F

&amp; N had no cause of action against his clients because the letter did not put them in

a bad light. He explained in para 6 of his written submissions as follows:</font>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns="">The thrust of the article is in respect of good

  corporate governance and specifically the duties owed by the board of CMB Asia towards its

  minority shareholders. The only reference to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs is of a purely

  factual nature: that CMB Asia is part of the restructuring of the F &amp; N Group and that

  the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares to CCS at the offered price.

  With regard to the latter, all the readers of the letter would know that and that the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Plaintiffs owed no duty to the shareholders of CMB Asia. Moreover, the 1st Plaintiffs were

  free to sell their shares in CMB Asia to whomsoever, whenever and whatever price they

  chose. Consequently there cannot be nor was there any defamatory imputation against the 1<sup>st</sup>

  Plaintiffs.</font><font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">15.    A perusal of the opening

two sentences of the letter will show that the scope of the letter is wider than that

suggested by Mr Khwaja. The sentences are as follows:</font>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify"><font size="3">Hot on the heels</font></p></i> of Times Publishing, we have

  another case of minority shareholders being <i>kept in the dark</i> and not having

  sufficient time to consider an offer for a company. <i>Again</i>, the company in question,

  CMB Asia, is part of the restructuring of the <i>Fraser and Neave group</i>.</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">16.    Even if the thrust of the letter

concerned good governance, there is clearly an insinuation that F &amp; N is involved in

keeping minority shareholders in the dark. It must not be overlooked that the CMB is first

referred to in the letter as a part of the F &amp; N group. "Kept in the dark"

has negative connotations and suggests that minority shareholders have deliberately been

denied information to which they are entitled with respect to the proposed takeover. The

term "again" was obviously a carefully chosen word. Coming after the use of the

words "hot on the heels" and "another case", the reader must think

that there is a connection between the restructuring of the F &amp; N group and the

keeping of minority shareholders in the two restructured companies in the dark.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17.    The insinuation that F &amp; N did

something wrong continues in the following paragraph. It states that "Fraser and

Neave, with 34 per cent, <i>readily assented</i>" to a price which was at a "<i>heavily

written-down book value</i> and <i>not much above the company’s holding of cash in

the bank</i>". Read with the rest of the letter, the impression given is that F &amp;

N was so keen to have the deal done that it was willing to accept an inadequate price for

its shares and at the expense of not giving minority shareholders enough time to consider

the offer or sufficient information to make an informed choice.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">18.    The following sentence from

the letter rings the death knell for the assertion that the letter does not have any

reference to F &amp; N:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><i>Once again</i>, as in the case of Times Publishing … minority

  shareholders risk falling <i>victim </i>to an "<i>inside job</i>".</p>
</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">19.    In the above sentence, the

reader is reminded once again of the Times Publishing case, which also involved F &amp; N.

An allegation was made that in both cases, minority shareholders risked falling

"victim" to an "inside job". The terms "victim" and

"inside job" have negative connotations. The term "inside job" refers

to a crime or wrongdoing against anyone by an affiliated person or someone working for or

trusted by the victim. As F &amp; N was involved in both cases and there was an inside job

in the two cases, the reader would think that F &amp; N is party to the "inside

job", and especially so since they "readily" assented to selling their

shares at a very low price. The word "victim" certainly suggests that the

minority shareholders have been wronged by F &amp; N as well.</font>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">20.    In view of the aforesaid, I

had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that F &amp; N had reason to feel aggrieved

by the letter and that there was a case for determining the natural and ordinary meaning

of the words in the letter.</font>
<u xmlns=""><i><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">My construction of the letter</font>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">21.    I accepted that there was an

insinuation in the letter that F &amp; N acted improperly by agreeing with CCS and CMB to

ensure that minority shareholders had no real alternative but to accept an inadequate

price for their shares by ensuring that they were not given material information in

respect of the takeover and that they were not given enough time to consider the offer. In

that sense, they were "forced" to accept the offer. However, I was not satisfied

that an ordinary reader of the <i>Business Times </i>would, without more, have assumed

that there was a "conspiracy". I also found it unnecessary to add the words

"readily assenting in the sale of its shares to CCS at a heavily written down book

value" to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, as proposed by F &amp; N.

Finally, I modified the words "suppressing material information with respect to the

takeover" in the Assistant Registrar’s ruling. In view of the aforesaid, I ruled

that the allegedly defamatory words in the letter were meant and were understood to mean

that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[F &amp; N] acted improperly by agreeing with Crown Cork &amp; Seal

  ("CCS") and CMB Asia Ltd in relation to the takeover of CMB Asia Ltd by CCS, to

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) ensuring that material information was not provided to the minority

    shareholders in respect of the said take over; and/<u>or</u></p>
<p align="justify">(b) ensuring that there was insufficient time for the minority
