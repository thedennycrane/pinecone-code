<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Plaintiff wife (“the Wife”)
                    filed for divorce on 16 July 2009 after 15 years of marriage to the Defendant
                    husband (“the Husband”) on the grounds that he had behaved in such
                    a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. The Interim
                    Judgment of Divorce was granted on 6 October 2009, and the ancillary matters
                    fell to be determined over five separate days of hearing. Orders relating to
                    custody, care, control of and access to the three children of the marriage were
                    made on 6 August 2010. Notably, at the hearing on 6 August 2010, the parties
                    agreed to joint custody of the children, with care and control to the Wife, and
                    an order in terms was duly granted. The Husband was given access to the children
                    within the framework of a defined set of liberal and flexible arrangements, to
                    wit:</p>

                    and the division of the matrimonial assets were made on 22 March 2011, and they
                    included the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_1"></a>(1)     The Wife shall transfer all her
                        rights, interest, and title in the property known as and situated at
                        [address redacted] (“the DDD property”) to the Husband. The
                        Husband shall pay for the outstanding monthly mortgage repayments towards
                        the discharge of the mortgage loans secured on the DDD property. The Husband
                        shall bear the costs and expenses relating to the aforesaid

                        The Wife shall pay for the outstanding monthly mortgage repayments towards
                        the discharge of the mortgage loan secured on the MMM property. The Wife
                        shall bear the costs and expenses relating to the aforesaid transfer. The
                        moneys withdrawn from the Husband’s CPF Account are not refundable to
                        the Husband or to the Husband’s CPF Account upon transfer of the
                        Husband’s share of the MMM property to the Wife.</p>

                        (“the [Malaysian] property”) to the Husband. The Husband shall
                        bear the costs and expenses relating to the aforesaid

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_6"></a>(6)     The [Husband] shall pay maintenance to the [Wife] in the sum of
                        $8,400.00 a month which sum is to be deposited into the Wife’s DBS
                        account no [xxxxxxxxx]. The first payment is to be made on 1 April 2011. A
                        breakdown of the said sum of $8,400.00 is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_6-p3_i"></a>(i)       the sum of $2,500.00 for the

                            and the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_7"></a>(7)     In addition, the [Husband] shall pay to the [Wife] (and
                        not on a reimbursement basis) the children’s expenses in relation to
                        their education, insurance policies and weekly pocket
                money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Husband has appealed against the Orders made
                    on 22 March 2011. I now publish the reasons for my decisions on maintenance
                    and division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties were married on 19 January 1994 and
                    were divorced 15 years later. They are both presently 45 years of age. Their son
                    [E] is 16 years old, and their two daughters, [F] and [G] are respectively 13
                    and 8 years old (“the Children”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Wife has a diploma in Building and Quantity
                    Surveying from Singapore Polytechnic. For the first five years of the marriage,
                    she worked full-time as a quantity surveyor and project manager. From 1999 until
                    the marriage ended in 2009, the Wife was a full-time homemaker, and she was
                    financially dependent on the Husband. The Husband is a shareholder and the
                    Managing Director of his family company known as [OO] Pte Ltd
                    (“OO”). He claimed to be drawing a net monthly salary of $9,100,
                    and that he was able to meet his monthly expenses with personal loans from his
                    mother, and OO. The Husband also received additional income from his
                    investments. He claimed that OO declared a one-time dividend payment and that
                    was in November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       During the marriage, the Husband gave the Wife
                    supplementary credit cards issued by various financial institutions such as
                    American Express, OCBC, POSB, ABN AMRO, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and
                    the Royal Bank of Scotland. According to the Wife, she would be told by the
                    Husband which supplementary card to use to pay the bills and expenses of the
                    household and family. The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s evidence in
                    general save that he confirmed that she usually made used of three supplementary
                    credit cards and that all the credit cards were cancelled in July 2009. During
                    the marriage, at different periods of time, the Wife received monthly payments
                    from three sources: (a) a business known as [PP], the sum of $4,000; (b) a
                    business known as [QQ], the sum of $3,000 and (c) rental of $3,200 from the MMM
                    property. I will elaborate on these receipts in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties have three real properties that they
                    hold as joint tenants, and these form the bulk of the matrimonial assets.
                    Firstly there is the DDD property, a semi-detached house that was purchased in
                    1994 for $1.74m and it had appreciated in value to about $2.85m at the time of
                    the hearing. This was the matrimonial home. Secondly, there is the MMM property,
                    a ground floor apartment, which was purchased in 1995 for $943,000 and valued at
                    $1.85m at the time of the hearing. Lastly, the parties have the Malaysian
                    property in Port Dickson with an agreed value of $32,866.46.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Besides the above, the parties
                    also have in their joint names several bank and investment accounts, but these
                    have a total negative value of -$14,939.70.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Husband’s disclosed assets were as
                    follows: a 20% share in a property known as [address redacted] (hereafter
                    referred to as “One Jervois”) that he co-owned with his brother,
                    shares, various insurance policies, his CPF moneys and several other bank
                    accounts. As mentioned earlier, the Husband is a shareholder of OO, a private
                    family company started by the Husband’s parents in 1984. I agreed with the
                    Husband’s counsel, Ms Bernice Loo (“Ms Loo”), that the OO
                    shares were not a “matrimonial asset” within the meaning of s
                    112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The OO shares were
                    acquired before marriage and were not improved upon by the Wife. They were
                    therefore rightly excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The total value
                    of the Husband’s disclosed assets was $729,545.74.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    However, the Husband has an outstanding tax liability of $69,188.85 arising from
                    his share of the taxable profits derived from the sale of the Queen Astrid Park
                    property in 2006. Therefore, the total net value of assets in the
                    Husband’s name was $660,356.89.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is a convenient juncture to mention that the
                    personal bank account balances disclosed by the Husband did not appear to be
                    supported by his version of the evidence. The Husband claimed that he had
                    $13,565.88 in his Standard Chartered current account and $23.61 in his Citibank
                    Ready Credit account as at July 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> There were negligible or negative values
                    in all the bank accounts that he held jointly with the Plaintiff, and the
                    balances gave the appearance that the Husband had extremely low cash reserves at
                    his disposal. The Husband said that his monthly expenses amounted to $23,517,
                    and to defray these he received loans from his mother and later advances from
                    OO. By way of explanation, the Husband claimed that he received payments of
                    $12,000 twice a month from OO; the total of $24,000 comprising firstly his
                    salary of $9,100 and a secondly a loan of $14,900. This alleged loan had been
                    provided by his mother through OO since 2005. In connection with the loan from
                    his mother, in his 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit, the Husband stated
                    that the monthly loan was $14,000 and exhibited one bank statement in support of
                    his contention. In doing so, he suggested that he was still receiving the
                    monthly loan from his mother in 2009. I noted that the Husband had exhibited
                        <em>only one</em> bank statement in support of these
                    bimonthly payments<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, which showed one payment of $12,000 at the
                    end of June 2009, and another payment of $12,000 at the beginning of July 2009;
                    rather than two payments of $12,000 within the same month. In short, the
                    documentary evidence did not support the Husband’s story. The logical
                    inference is that he must have other undisclosed accounts elsewhere, and the
                    discrepancy suggested that the Husband’s net worth was arguably more than
                    the total amount disclosed in his affidavits. Quite unexpectedly, the Husband in
                    his 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit modified his earlier affidavit
                    evidence to claim that the loan was $14,900 and not $14,000 and that since the
                    year 2007/2008, he had stopped borrowing from his mother, and instead borrowed
                    the same sum of $14,900 from OO directly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> I will elaborate further on the loans in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Wife’s disclosed assets were as
                    follows: shares, a motor car, her CPF moneys, several bank and investment
                    accounts and some insurance policies. She also holds two fixed deposit accounts
                    jointly with her mother. Unlike the Husband, the Wife has no outstanding
                    liabilities, and the total value of assets in her name was $822,422.03 in
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ positions on division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Husband’s position on division of
                    the matrimonial assets was consistent throughout the hearings. He wanted the MMM
                    property sold and to apply the sale proceeds in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     To repay the outstanding housing
                        loan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     To refund
                        the moneys withdrawn from both the Wife and the Husband’s CPF Accounts
                        plus accrued interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     To pay the costs of and incidental to the sale of the MMM
                        Property, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The available balance of the sale proceeds is to be divided in the
                        proportion of 30% to the Wife and 70% to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As for the other assets in joint names and the
                    assets in the respective names of the Husband and the Wife, the Husband’s
                    position was that a division in the ratio of 80:20 in favour of the Husband was
                    fair and equitable. Finally, he wanted the Wife’s name removed as a named
                    beneficiary from his AXA insurance policy no [xxxxxxxxx].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Unlike the Husband, the Wife’s position
                    on division of the matrimonial assets went through several rounds of change,
                    starting with the position outlined in the Fact and Position Sheet and repeated
                    in the Skeletal Submissions tendered by the Wife’s counsel, Mr Koh Tien
                    Hua (“Mr Koh”), on 6 August 2010. Initially, the Wife asked for a
                    just and equitable division of the matrimonial home based on her indirect
                    contributions to the marriage and family including looking after the home. As
                    for the MMM property, there was no dispute that the Wife withdrew a principal
                    amount of $110,326.35 from her CPF Account towards the acquisition of the MMM
                    property. However, the Husband disputed her allegations that she had in the
                    course of the marriage maintained and paid for the repairs to the property
                    including the efforts she allegedly made to rent out the property. In relation
                    to the MMM property and the other matrimonial assets in the names of the
                    Husband, the Wife wanted a share based on a just and equitable division. The
                    Husband was willing to transfer his share in the Malaysian property to the Wife
                    as part of the division of matrimonial assets without selling it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the adjourned hearing on 16 September 2010,
                    Mr Koh brought up the Wife’s proposal: that each party should be given one
                    property. In other words, the Wife would keep the MMM property and the DDD
                    property would go to the Husband. Mr Koh explained that the Wife’s
                    proposal for a “swap” was just and equitable in the circumstances
                    bearing in mind her direct financial and non-financial contributions to the
                    acquisition and maintenance of the MMM property, her indirect contributions as a
                    homemaker to the marriage, family and care of the home as well as her
                    contributions to the businesses of PP and QQ. The tenancy on the MMM property
                    would expire in 2012, and the Wife’s idea was to utilise the rental to pay
                    for rented accommodation for her and the Children until the expiry of tenancy in
                    2012. At the adjourned hearing on 16 September 2010, the Wife’s stand as
                    advanced by Mr Koh was that the Husband had not accounted for $600,000 of the
                    profits derived from the sale of the property at Queen Astrid Park and that sum
                    should, therefore, be included in the pool of assets for division. The Wife
                    reckoned that she should be awarded 30% of the sale proceeds of $600,000. The
                    Wife wanted the Malaysian property sold and be given 50% of the sale proceeds.
                    As for the property known as One Jervois, Mr Koh pointed out that in the absence
                    of documentary evidence to support the Husband’s claim that his share in
                    the property was only 20%, and working from the basis of his ownership of 100%,
                    the Wife should be granted 30% of the value of One Jervois after deduction of
                    the outstanding loan. Finally, each party was to retain the assets held in their
                    respective names. Assets held on behalf of the Children were to be excluded from
                    the pool of assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the adjourned hearing on 30 November 2010,
                    Ms Loo confirmed that One Jervois had been sold and the Husband’s share of
                    the sale proceeds was only $404,273.29 based on his 20% co-ownership of the
                        property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> At the same hearing, Mr Koh informed the
                    court of the Wife’s revised position: that in exchange for the MMM
                    property, (a) the Wife would take over the outstanding mortgage loan and the
                    Husband would have to refund the moneys withdrawn from his CPF Account together
                    with interest from his own resources; and (b) she would give up her claim to the
                    DDD property including her claims in respect of the $600,000 profits derived
                    from the sale of the property at Queen Astrid Park and the $404,273.29 derived
                    from the sale of One Jervois. However, the Wife still wanted 30% of the moneys
                    in the Husband’s bank accounts. Mr Koh also advised that the Wife would
                    not claim against the insurance policies in the Husband’s name. As for
                    assets in the Wife’s name, Mr Koh advised that the Wife wanted to retain
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At the adjourned hearing on 22 February 2011,
                    Mr Koh confirmed the Wife’s final position on the division of matrimonial
                    assets. For the MMM Property, the Wife would pay the outstanding mortgage
                    without a refund of the moneys withdrawn from the Husband’s CPF Account or
                    the corresponding accrued interest. In return, she would also forgo her claims
                    for a share of (a) the DDD property; (b) the profits of about $600,000 derived
                    from the sale of the Queen Astrid property (c) the sum of $404,273.29 the
                    Husband obtained from the sale proceeds of One Jervois; (d) the bank and
                    investment accounts listed under “(B) Defendant’s Assets”
                    item 4 of Tab 1 to the Defendant’s written submissions filed on 6 August
                    2010; and (e) the sum of $174,000 provided by the Husband’s father for the
                    purchase of the DDD property. Each party would keep the policies in their
                    respective names as well as moneys in their CPF Accounts as at August 2009. Mr
                    Koh clarified that if the Husband decided to refund to his CPF Account the
                    moneys which he withdrew to acquire the MMM property and the corresponding
                    accrued interest, the Husband would have to refund these sums from his own
                    financial resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Section 112 of the Women’s Charter </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Section 112 of the Women’s Charter
                    provides for the court to divide matrimonial assets upon divorce in a just and
                    equitable manner. The legislation confers a wide discretion on the court dealing
                    with the division of matrimonial assets. The court will consider the factors
                    listed in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, and “a multi-factorial
                    approach” to division based broadly on the factors relevant to the case
                    is usually undertaken (per Andrew Phang JA in <em>Pang Rosaline v
                        Chan Kong Chin</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 (“<em>Pang Rosaline</em>”) at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is convenient to now set out the relevant
                    provisions of s 112(2):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>112. (2) ..</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its
                        powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to
                        all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property
                        or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of
                        the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any
                        aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The court will decide on the weight to be
                    given to any one factor. Nowadays, it is common that both parties work, and the
                    financial responsibilities are shared together with caring for the Children and
                    home. Each case is fact-specific especially as to the degree of the shared
                    responsibilities between the spouses. However, where the husband earned the
                    money and the wife looked after the home and the Children, there should be no
                    bias in favour of the working spouse against the homemaker. This is clear from
                    Phang JA’s observations in <em>Pang Rosaline</em> at
                        [23] where he emphasised that a
                    party’s direct financial contribution to any particular matrimonial asset
                    is not <em>prima facie</em> determinative of how the asset
                    is to be divided, and that indirect contributions, which cannot be ascribed a
                    monetary value, can be accorded as much or even more weight than financial
                    contributions if so warranted on the facts in evidence. Section 112(2)(d) is
                    particularly important for the homemaker whose contributions are likely to be to
                    the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the
                    family. To illustrate, I refer to <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang
                        Choo Nancy</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<em>Yeo Chong Lin</em>”). In that case, the direct
                    financial contributions were made by the husband while the indirect
                    non-financial contributions were made by the wife. The husband also paid for the
                    expenses of the family and the Children’s education overseas. The
                    appellate court did not disturb Judith Prakash J’s finding that the wife
                    contributed to the family and the marriage to the best of her ability by taking
                    on the roles of homemaker and mother. Prakash J viewed the matrimonial assets on
                    a global basis and divided the assets to the wife and the husband in proportions
                    of 35:65 respectively. The Court of Appeal commented that “35% of a large
                    pool of matrimonial assets would be [just] to a spouse whose contributions were
                    all in the domestic sphere” (at [82] of the judgment). Again in <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21,
                    the homemaker wife did not make direct contributions to the assets acquired by
                    the husband. The wife’s claim was based on her contributions to the
                    welfare of the family. The court recognised the importance of non-financial
                    contributions to the welfare of the family and noted that s 112(2)(d) of the
                    Women’s Charter obliges the court to take into account the extent of the
                    contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking
                    after the home or caring for the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the Wife was a homemaker
                    although she worked before F was born. Typically as was the case here, the
                    working spouse would have contributed to the bulk of the assets. As the working
                    spouse, the Husband provided financially for the family. One salient feature of
                    the marriage was the inclusion of the Wife’s name in the titles to the
                    properties to which she had made no direct financial contributions. Apart from
                    the MMM property where she contributed financially to the acquisition of the
                    property, the Husband permitted the Wife’s name to be included as a joint
                    tenant to the DDD property. He had also permitted her name to be included as a
                    joint tenant to the Malaysian property when she was his fiancée. There were bank
                    accounts and investment accounts that were held jointly by the parties. It was
                    not disputed that the Wife did not contribute financially to these accounts. I
                    noted that the Husband explained in his 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit
                    at paragraph 246 that he had “included her name because [he] loved her,
                    she was [his] wife and [he had] wanted her to feel
                    ‘included’”. In the context of the factual matrix in the
                    present proceedings, the Husband’s conduct as exemplified by his
                    commitment to joint ownership was clear evidence of his position that the
                    properties were matrimonial property for the benefit of the union and the
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the hearings of the ancillary matters, the
                    Husband’s stand on what would be a just and equitable division of the
                    matrimonial assets suffered from an over-emphasis of his financial
                    contributions, and he attempted to downplay the Wife’s indirect
                    contributions to the marriage and family. Much of the debate was on the
                    parties’ level of indirect contributions to welfare of the Children. I
                    will examine the evidence and arguments later under the heading of
                    “Indirect Contributions”. Suffice it to say, the Wife’s
                    final proposal merited scrutiny to see if it could measure up to a just and
                    equitable division of the matrimonial assets. I should explain at the outset
                    that the detailed narrative of the Wife’s different proposals above was
                    not intended to suggest a weakening of her position after each adjournment.
                    Rather, the Wife’s final proposal was focused on the one property where
                    she saw the evidence to be most advantageous to her case. There was nothing
                    wrong with this stratagem as it was sensible. Needless to say, had the final
                    proposal crystallised sooner, it would have reduced the number of hearings,
                    spared the parties some emotional distress and saved them some time and
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Financial contributions towards the acquisition of the real
                properties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The DDD property was purchased after the
                    parties were married in 1994 for $1.74m and its value has since appreciated to
                    about $2.85m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s father had contributed
                    $174,000 or 10% of the purchase price in 1994 as down payment for the
                        house.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Although the Husband
                    claimed that this was a loan, it was not his case that his father had demanded
                    repayment. However, if the property was to be sold, the Husband wanted the
                    father’s loan to be repaid. Initially, the Wife argued that the $174,000
                    was a gift to the married couple, and through this gift, she claimed her
                    financial contribution to the purchase of the property. However, she later
                    dropped this claim in the light of her proposal for the properties to be
                    swapped. Moving on to the encumbrances, there are two substantial outstanding
                    mortgages amounting to $1,603,217.15 taken out on the property, bringing its net
                    value to $1,246,782.85. One of the mortgages was for a sum of $700,000 to cover
                    the Husband’s Forex losses in 2008. The DDD property was thus used as
                    collateral for $700,000 of the Husband’s investment losses. The monthly
                    mortgage of $9,261.36<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> was paid from an account in the parties’
                    joint names, but it was not disputed that the Wife did not make any
                    contributions to this joint account. The Wife had made no financial contribution
                    to the acquisition of the DDD property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Husband made two broad arguments: The
                    first was that since the Wife would ordinarily benefit from the investment
                    gains, she should likewise be responsible for the investment losses.
                    Accordingly, as the argument developed, the Wife should bear part of the
                    Husband’s Forex losses or the outstanding liabilities under the second
                    mortgage. I did not consider the Husband’s argument as valid and
                    meritorious. The Wife was a homemaker since 1999 and was financially dependent
                    on the Husband. As the Husband was the sole breadwinner, it fell on the Husband
                    to take on the financial responsibility of taking care of the needs of the
                    family and household as well as to finance the purchases that now represent the
                    bulk of the assets. I did not think that upon termination of the marriage, the
                    family arrangement that had prevailed over the last 15 years should suddenly
                    change in such a way as to make the Wife pay for her share of the investment
                    losses sustained during the marriage. The second argument related to the
                    Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage and family. To the Husband,
                    the Wife’s indirect contributions were not significant because she always
                    had a maid to help with the care of the Children and the home, and that in
                    recent years the Wife neglected the family and home after she befriended a
                    medium, Anna. Therefore, her share of the DDD property should not be more than
                    20% which to the Husband was a generous division. I will deal with this second
                    argument in the subsequent section headed “Indirect contributions”
                    (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The MMM property was purchased in 1995 for a
                    sum of $943,000. At the time of the hearing, the market value of the property
                    had more than doubled and was worth $1.85 million. There was an outstanding
                    mortgage of $108,676.02, which meant that the net value of the property was
                    $1,741,323.98. The down payment of $94,300 was from the Husband’s
                        father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Like in the earlier loan, it was not the
                    Husband’s case that his father had demanded repayment of the money.
                    However, he wanted the property sold. In the event, the father’s loan had
                    to be repaid from the sale proceeds. Initially, the Wife again argued that the
                    $94,300 was a gift to the married couple. However, she later dropped this claim
                    in the light of her property swap proposal. Now, in respect of this property,
                    both parties had contributed financially to its acquisition. The principal
                    amount withdrawn from the Wife’s CPF Account was $110,326.35. In
                    Husband’s case, the principal amount withdrawn from his CPF Account was
                    $328,136.67. The Husband made capital repayments totalling $370,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> by utilising part of the profits derived
                    from the sale of the Queen Astrid Park property which Ms Loo accepted was a
                    matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In relation to the MMM property, the Husband
                    said that the Wife’s share of the net sale proceeds should be 30% given
                    her financial and non-financial contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Malaysian property was purchased in 1993,
                    and the Husband paid 100% of the purchase price for this property. At the time
                    of the hearing, it was worth $32,866.46. The Wife’s proposal to swap the
                    properties did not specifically cover the Malaysian property. In short, the last
                    time it was raised was at the adjourned hearing of 16 September 2010 where Mr
                    Koh submitted that the Wife wanted the Malaysian property sold and that she
                    should be given 50% of the sale proceeds. Presumably, her position remained the
                    same throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Husband received a windfall when his 2006
                    investment with two friends in a new property at Queen Astrid Park returned a
                    handsome profit of $931,713 for the Husband. With his profit of $931,713, he
                    made a capital repayment of $370,000 to reduce the mortgage of the MMM property.
                    He then used $310,000 as down payment for One Jervois. I pause here to comment
                    on the Wife’s contention that the Husband’s interest in One Jervois
                    was not 20% as there was no documentary proof of his shareholding. In my view,
                    there was no evidential basis for the Wife’s contention. The Husband
                    exhibited a letter from his conveyancing lawyer dated 28 October 2008 confirming
                    his 20% interest as tenants in common with his brother who held the remaining
                        80%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> I should also mention
                    Ms Loo’s confirmation that One Jervois had been sold and that the
                    Husband’s share of the sale proceeds was $404,273.29 (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). Another contention was over the
                    Husband’s claim that he utilised $50,000 of the profits to buy the
                    Wife’s car. In any case, the rest of the money (<em>ie</em>, $201,713) was apparently invested through the DBS Vickers
                    investment accounts and Saxo Bank investment accounts. In the property swap
                    proposal, Mr Koh confirmed that the Wife would drop her claim for division of
                    this One Jervois sale proceeds, and the sum of $201,713 that the Husband had
                    invested through the DBS Vickers investment accounts and Saxo Bank investment
                    accounts. Likewise, I would imagine that the remaining $50,000, whether it was
                    spent on the car or not, would also not be an issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Wife had left her career as quantity
                    surveyor and building project manager in 1999 to take on the roles of a full
                    time homemaker, a parent and caregiver to the Children. During the marriage, the
                    Wife would do the marketing and shop for groceries, cook for the family, and
                    drive the Children to and from their school and activities. Although there was a
                    full-time maid, the Wife said she supervised the maid to ensure that the
                    household ran smoothly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the course of the marriage, the Wife
                    assisted the Husband in two business ventures. In one venture, she was
                    registered as the sole proprietor of PP, and the Husband was the registered
                    proprietor of QQ. Both businesses were joint enterprises between the Husband and
                    Wife: he brought in the business and she satisfied the administrative needs of
                    the business. The parties argued on who between the two of them provided the
                    start up cost of $10,000. Be that as it may, in my view, PP and QQ were
                    businesses generated by the joint efforts of the parties for the benefit of the
                    marriage and family. The Wife admitted that the monthly drawings of $4,000 from
                    PP were used for “their expenses”. The monthly drawings of $3,000
                    from QQ were put aside as “their savings”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Wife appeared to have corrected
                    her evidence in a later affidavit to state that the money she received from PP
                    and QQ were used only for household expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     According to the Husband, the Wife’s
                    evidence on the monthly drawings was misleading. He argued that the Wife never
                    at one time received monthly allowances from both businesses. The monthly
                    allowance from PP was paid between 2004 and 2006. In the first year, the monthly
                    allowance was about $3,000 but it subsequently increased to $4,000 monthly. The
                    Husband said that PP ceased to carry on business in 2006. As for QQ, the
                    business was set up in 2006. Between 2006 and 2007, the Wife was paid a monthly
                    figure of $3,000 by QQ until it stopped trading in 2007. In response, the Wife
                    disputed the Husband’s claim that PP ceased business in 2006. She was able
                    to produce invoices to prove that PP was still carrying business as late as
                    August 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, she only stopped receiving
                    monthly allowance from QQ in January 2008, and not in 2007 as alleged by the
                    Husband. The evidence supported the Wife’s claim in that she was able to
                    show from invoices that QQ was still doing business in May 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I did not think that the conflicting
                    evidence was material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my view, the material evidence the Husband
                    gave was the source of the $50,000 invested in the Queen Astrid Park property.
                    Out of this $50,000, a sum of $42,000 came from the account of PP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> This fact was significant as the
                    Husband utilised part of the huge profit he made from the Queen Astrid Park
                    property to make capital repayments totalling $370,000 in two tranches
                        (<em>ie</em>, $200,000 in 2006 and $170,000 in
                        2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>) towards reducing the
                    loan the parties had taken to acquire the MMM property. In this regard, the
                    $42,000 represented funds from the joint enterprise, <em>viz</em> PP that was invested by the Husband, and the windfall
                    derived from the investment enabled the capital repayments to be made. In this
                    regard, the capital repayments were traceable to the $42,000 that came from the
                    Wife’s indirect contribution to the joint enterprise and was thus relevant
                    and should not be ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To the Husband, the Wife’s indirect
                    contributions were not substantial because she always had a full-time maid to
                    help with the care of the Children and the home, and that in recent years the
                    Wife neglected the family and home after her association with a medium, Anna.
                    This allegation of neglect was denied by the Wife who maintained that Anna was
                    not a medium but was the chairperson of Wat Samnak Poh Pu Lersi Na Lai, a
                    charitable organisation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I make three
                    points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Firstly, I rejected as unsustainable the
                    argument that the Wife was assisted by a full-time maid as a reason to diminish
                    the Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage, care of the household
                    and well being of the family. The evidence before me did not bear out the
                    Husband’s claim. This was a 15 year marriage with three Children. The
                    Husband’s argument ignored the Wife’s parental responsibilities
                    towards the Children. In the words of Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) in
                        <em>Lee Chung Meng Joseph v Krygsman</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 965 at [41] (and
                    approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pang Rosaline</em>
                    at [18]), “[h]aving a maid in the
                    household, or a number of maids for that matter, does not mean abdication of
                    parental responsibility towards the child”. Furthermore, by the
                    husband’s own evidence, he admitted to the Wife’s supervision of the
                    Children before their school examinations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He accepted that the Wife did the
                    marketing and shopped for groceries but she was accompanied by the Husband and
                    these activities stopped two years ago (<em>ie</em>, these
                    activities stopped in 2008 since the Husband’s affidavit was filed in
                        2010).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Wife disputed the Husband’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Secondly, I noted that the Wife’s
                    alleged neglect of family and home was <em>after</em> she
                    befriended Anna. In other words, the Husband’s argument carried the
                    implication that the Wife had contributed to the domestic sphere in her roles as
                    mother, wife and housekeeper until she befriended Anna. Thirdly, the allegation
                    of neglect could not have been as bad as the Husband had wanted this court to
                        bel<em>ie</em>ve. A compelling factor militating
                    against the allegation of the Wife’s neglect of the Children was the
                    Husband’s willingness to give care and control of the Children to the
                    Wife. In his 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of 10 March 2010, the
                    Husband unreservedly accepted the Wife’s proposal made in her
                        1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of 29 December 2009 that joint
                    custody of the Children should be granted to both parents, with care and control
                    to the Wife and reasonable access to the Husband. At the hearing on 6 August
                    2010, Ms Loo confirmed the Husband’s agreement to joint custody with care
                    and control to the Wife, and I so ordered. As for access, the Husband’s
                    proposal was set out in Ms Loo’s submissions. The Wife agreed to most of
                    the Husband’s demands except for dinners thrice a week with the Children.
                    The Order on access is set out at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In relation to the Husband’s indirect
                    contributions, the Husband claimed to have been a committed parent and that even
                    though he had to travel several times a year on business and that he worked
                    full-time, he still made the effort to fetch the Children to their activities on
                    the weekends, and to spend as much time as possible with them. The Wife did not
                    agree that the Husband was as involved in the lives of the Children as he would
                    have this court believe. She claimed that the Husband was too busy with his
                    business and spent little time with the Children preferring to spend the
                    evenings in front of the television. That said, elsewhere in her affidavit, the
                    Wife admitted (a) that the Husband would bring the Children out and fetch them
                    home, presumably from school or activities,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and (b) to the Husband’s
                    generosity and that he had provided well for the family. She also admitted to
                    the Husband’s weekly outings with the family to the cinema and the family
                    would often dine at well-known restaurants. From the overall evidence, my
                    impression was that both parties were involved parents. The parents’
                    relationships with the Children, and the Children’s relatively good
                    academic results and busy extra-curricular activities bear testimony to a caring
                    and conducive familial support system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Wife claimed that she worked as
                    “the builder” for both the DDD and MMM properties when the
                    properties were renovated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The Husband claimed that he had made the
                    final decisions on choice of the contractors and materials for the properties,
                    and that the Wife had made minimal contribution to the renovations. Given the
                    Wife’s qualifications and experience in the construction and building
                    industry, I believe that the Wife would have contributed her skill and
                    experience to the renovations, but whether these were received and accepted by
                    the Husband was another matter. The Wife revealed that the Husband was
                    domineering and would insist on his way. In the end, the fact remained that when
                    the marriage was ongoing and the relationship between the parties was good, the
                    parties seemed committed to improving the family’s assets
                together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of the matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Having considered the matters set out above, I
                    found the proposal that each party to take one of the properties in Singapore
                    workable, and above all it was commensurate with a fair and equitable division.
                    Upon the transfer of the MMM property from the Husband to the Wife, there would
                    be no refund of the Husband’s CPF moneys that were used for the purchase
                    of this property. The MMM property is tenanted until 2012 at a current monthly
                    rental of $3,650. However, the Husband would transfer $3,200 of the monthly
                    rental to the Wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Wife confirmed that she was left to pay
                    the maintenance charges of $340 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> After the resolution of the ancillary
                    matters, the Wife would have to move out of the DDD property and find suitable
                    accommodation for herself and the Children. The Wife had indicated that, in the
                    meantime, she would use the rental from the MMM property to pay for the rented
                    accommodation for herself and the Children. I thought it fair and equitable that
                    the parties should be allowed to retain the assets in their own names. The value
                    of the assets retained by the Wife would help her pay for the MMM property
                    mortgage, and start her new home for the Children. Allowing the Wife to retain
                    her car meant that she would be able to provide transport and run errands for
                    the Children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I have already commented on the DDD property
                    above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>-<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>. Compared to the Wife, the Husband was better placed
                    financially. By reference to his earning capacity in the family business and, if
                    necessary, the financial support of his parents, he would have the financial
                    resources to shoulder the mortgage liabilities secured against the DDD property.
                    As for the third piece of real property, the Malaysian property, the Husband was
                    allowed to keep it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Wife sought from the Husband a monthly
                    payment of $10,300 as maintenance for herself and the Children. In essence, as
                    Mr Koh explained, the Wife wanted the same amount of money that she had received
                    during the marriage, and this figure came from the same three sources mentioned
                    in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above. According to the Wife, she
                    received (a) the sum of $3,000 monthly from QQ until January 2008; (b) the sum
                    of $4,000 monthly from PP until June 2009; and (c) the sum of $3,200 monthly
                    being the rental proceeds from the MMM property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The Wife’s claim for $10,300 was
                    based on items (a), (b), and the 2007 monthly rental of $3,300 for the MMM
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Section 114 of the Women’s Charter
                    stipulates the matters that the court would consider in determining the quantum
                    of maintenance to be the Wife and Children. The Wife is, therefore, required to
                    justify her claim for the sum of $10,300 as monthly maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Looking back to the time before the breakdown
                    of the marriage, the family had enjoyed a relatively high standard of living.
                    They lived in the DDD semi-detached landed property, the Wife held many
                    supplementary credit cards given to her by the Husband, and he gave her
                    expensive gifts of watches and jewellery. The Children had a wide variety of
                    extracurricular activities including language lessons, swimming and taekwondo
                    classes, and either of the parties would drive them there in the family car. The
                    Husband was the only working spouse but the Wife received allowances from the
                    enterprises set up by the parties. She also received the monthly rental income
                    from the MMM property. The allowances and rental income were applied towards
                    their expenses. It was not disputed that the Wife also used the supplementary
                    credit cards to pay the household and family expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Husband’s monthly expenses amounted
                    to $23,517, of which roughly half went towards paying off the mortgage and
                    property tax for the MMM and DDD properties. The Husband also claimed that he
                    drew a net monthly income of $9,100. At first glance, this seems to be an
                    egregious case of spending beyond one’s means. The Husband, however,
                    explained that the gulf between his income and his expenses was bridged by the
                    solid support of his mother, who lent him a sum of $10,000 a month since early
                    2005, which was subsequently revised to $14,900 a month in June 2005 when the
                    Husband requested for more assistance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> As explained at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the Husband claimed that OO paid him $12,000 twice a
                    month, the total amount of $24,000 being the sum of $9,100 and $14,900. It was
                    also noted above that the Husband produced only one bank statement in 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) despite claiming to have had
                    received these payments since 2005. The Husband went on to claim that the loans
                    would probably cease after the ancillary proceedings were completed, because the
                    matrimonial assets would in all likelihood be sold off and he would no longer be
                    liable for the hefty mortgage payments due in respect of the properties in the
                    pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The mechanism by which the mother’s loan
                    was granted operated in the following manner. Apparently OO was indebted to the
                    Husband’s mother for a large sum, and it was decided that instead of
                    repaying the loan to the Husband’s mother directly, OO would simply pay
                    the sum owed to the Husband. In that way, the Husband’s mother would
                    transmit loans amounting to $14,900 a month to the Husband through OO. These
                    supposed loans from the Husband’s mother had been paid by OO since June
                        2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> However, the
                    Husband later claimed that in 2007/2008 he stopped borrowing from his mother and
                    borrowed the sum of $14,900 every month from OO instead. In his
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit, the Husband for the first time
                    introduced a loan from OO. At para 12, the Husband stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">OO has repaid my mother for the loan which she had extended to OO.
                        However, as I needed money to meet my expenses, in or around 2007/2008, I
                        continued drawing extra money from OO every month, as a loan from OO to
                        me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Apart from the Husband’s confirmation to
                    the auditor that he owed OO the sum of $170,000 as at 31 December
                        2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> and OO’s
                    confirmation to the auditor that it owed [J] (the Husband’s mother) the
                    sum of $142,781.19 as at 31 December 2006, the documentary evidence such as
                    OO’s financial statements and the one bank statement exhibited by the
                    Husband did not establish satisfactorily the Husband’s claim that the
                    mother’s loan was disbursed through OO. Be that as it may, throughout the
                    marriage there was available to the Husband enough money to fund his personal
                    expenses, mortgages repayments and the expenses of the household and
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The amount of household expenses claimed by
                    the Wife totalled $10,413.91. This included expenses related to the purchase of
                    groceries, utilities and maintenance of the household, the upkeep of the car and
                    the employment of the maid. I found the sums claimed by the Wife, in particular
                    those sums relating to the marketing and grocery bills, tonics, vitamins,
                    utilities, repairs of electronic goods, and maintenance of the car to be
                    excessive. I thought it fair that the Husband should pay the Wife a monthly sum
                    of $5,000 for the household expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Separately, the Wife claimed that the monthly
                    expenses for all three Children totalled $6,867.68, and these included expenses
                    related to education, insurance premiums, grooming, entertainment and leisure,
                    holidays/travel and birthday parties. I believe that some of the expenses
                    claimed by her were on the high side, in particular those relating to items like
                    holidays/travel, gifts, and clothes, shoes, bags, storybooks. For the last item,
                    the Wife claimed a sum of $1,500 a month. Her claim for “holidays/
                    travel” also amounted to $1,500 a month which I believe is excessive for
                    school going Children. Simply because the Husband spent $500 per month for his
                    personal travel was no justification for insisting on the same amount for the
                    Children and herself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> If travel expenses were for school trips
                    such as for sports, exchange programmes, and learning programmes, they would be
                    borne separately by the Husband under the Order of 22 March 2011. For the above
                    reasons I thought it fair that the Husband should bear the Children’s
                    monthly expenses (not on a reimbursement basis) relating to their education,
                    insurance policies and weekly pocket money, and he shall pay the Wife an
                    additional separate sum of $900 a month for the Children’s personal
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Mr Koh submitted that the Wife’s
                    personal expenses totalled $4,646.82 and these included expenses related to
                    handphone charges, clothes, shoes and bags, cosmetics, grooming, insurance,
                    food, holidays/travel, allowance for her parents and festive expenses such as
                    Christmas presents and Vesak Day charitable contributions. Some items of
                    expenses such as clothes, shoes and bags, handphone charges, holidays/travel,
                    festive expenses and donations were excessive. In the circumstances I thought it
                    fair that the Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $2,500 a month for her
                    personal expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In sum, the Husband is to pay the Wife a sum
                    of $8,400 a month as maintenance for herself and the Children. The breakdown of
                    this sum is $2,500 for the Wife’s personal expenses, $900 for the
                    Children’s personal expenses and $5,000 for the household expenses. In
                    addition, the Husband shall pay the Wife, and not on a reimbursement basis, the
                    Children’s expenses relating to their education, insurance policies and
                    weekly pocket money.</p>
