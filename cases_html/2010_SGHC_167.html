<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present appeals arose from the
                    appellants’ conviction and sentence by a District Judge (the
                    “DJ”) in <em>Public Prosecutor v Goh Kah Heng alias
                        Shi Ming Yi and Another</em> [2009] SGDC 499 (the
                    “GD”) and in <em>Public Prosecutor v Goh Kah Heng
                        alias Shi Ming Yi and Another</em> [2009] SGDC 500 (the
                    “GD on Sentence”). The appellants (“SMY” and
                    “RY”) were convicted after a 23-day trial in the District
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Originally, SMY faced ten charges but the
                    prosecution proceeded with only four relating to the grant of a $50,000 loan to
                    RY. SMY claimed trial to and was convicted on the following four charges:</p>

                        prepared a payment voucher no. PV200405-082 which falsely stated that a loan

                        Section 10(3) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       SMY was the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
                    of Ren Ci Hospital and Medicare Centre (“Ren Ci”) while RY was his
                    personal executive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to the prosecution, RY was someone
                    “very close and dear” to SMY and the “close and personal
                    relationship” between them was pivotal to a proper appreciation of the
                    facts of this case. The prosecution alleged that RY was able to obtain the said
                    $50,000 loan without documentation and repayment terms precisely because of this
                    relationship. It was also because of this relationship that the loan was not
                    repaid until E &amp; Y emerged on the Ren Ci scene, that SMY tried to cover up
                    the loan and lied to the Inquiry (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>
                    below) and to the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”).
                    Similarly, it was this relationship that explained why RY tried to shield SMY
                    from responsibility during the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       SMY met RY in Hong Kong sometime in 2000. SMY
                    went out of his way to secure RY’s employment at Ren Ci in 2001. When
                    RY’s application for an employment pass was rejected in April 2001, SMY
                    nevertheless offered him a job at Ren Ci in May that year. The job offer (to be
                    SMY’s assistant) was accepted by RY, with RY’s salary being paid by
                    SMY via an increase in SMY’s salary. SMY also went to meet officials at
                    the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) to appeal against the rejection
                    of RY’s application for an employment pass. He further made personal
                    appeals to two Members of Parliament on RY’s behalf. RY’s employment
                    pass was finally approved only in November 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       SMY indulged RY with supplementary credit cards
                    which RY used liberally. RY, an Australian citizen and permanent resident of
                    Singapore and Macao, stayed with SMY in various condominiums when RY was in
                    Singapore. They went on holidays together and even purchased two properties in
                    Melbourne, Australia, jointly. One property was bought in 2002 while the other
                    was bought in 2004. Each property apparently cost more than A$1 million. SMY
                    also bought a BMW car for RY’s personal use in Melbourne. Counsel for RY
                    explained that RY’s name was included in the Australian properties because
                    one of the owners had to be an Australian citizen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 17 May 2004, RY gave instructions to Ren
                    Ci’s finance manager to prepare a cash cheque (the “Cash
                    Cheque”) for $50,000 and a payment voucher (the “Payment
                    Voucher”) reflecting a loan of the same amount from Ren Ci to Mandala
                    Buddhist &amp; Cultural Centre (“Mandala”). Mandala was a
                    partnership business between SMY and one Wee Beng Seng, sanctioned by Ren Ci,
                    which was supposed to help generate income for Ren Ci. SMY signed the Cash
                    Cheque and Payment Voucher. The Cash Cheque was later encashed by a staff of Ren
                    Ci on RY’s behalf. RY took the cash and brought it to Hong Kong
                    subsequently. This amount was reflected in Ren Ci’s accounts as a loan to
                    Mandala but there was no corresponding entry in Mandala’s books showing
                    the receipt or disbursement of this $50,000. The money was never given to
                    Mandala. This anomaly was uncovered during the audit of Ren Ci’s books by
                    Ernst &amp; Young (“E &amp; Y”) following a corporate governance
                    review initiated by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) in the middle
                    of 2006, after the events surrounding the National Kidney Foundation
                    (“NKF”) had taken place. On 12 June 2007, RY tendered his
                    resignation from Ren Ci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 7 November 2007, a formal inquiry (the
                    “Inquiry”) under s 8 of the Charities Act (Cap 37,
                    2007 Rev Ed) was initiated by MOH to look into RC’s affairs. During
                    the course of the Inquiry, SMY gave evidence to the members of the Inquiry on
                    18 December 2007 that the $50,000 was a loan for Mandala to purchase wood,
                    something which was untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 2 January 2008, the Commissioner of
                    Charities asked SMY to provide documentary evidence of the purchase of wood.
                    Pursuant to this order, a letter (the “BJJHS Letter”) purportedly
                    from Bei Jing Jing Hai Shan Artifact Co Ltd (China) (“BJJHS”) was
                    given to the Commissioner. The BJJHS Letter stated that it had delivered two
                    statues worth $16,000 to Mandala and that there were 25m³ of surplus wood. This
                    was not true as the statues were in fact purchased and paid for by a different
                    entity. In February 2008, the CAD conducted a raid on Ren Ci. In March 2008, the
                    CAD called up SMY and RY for interviews.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings in the District Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First
                    Charge centred on the Payment Voucher dated 17 May 2004,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> evidencing a loan of
                    $50,000 from Ren Ci to Mandala.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The prosecution argued that RY took the loan
                    directly from Ren Ci as Mandala did not have the funds to make the loan. As RY
                    was not a staff of Ren Ci in May 2004, he was not entitled to such a loan but,
                    in the light of the relationship between the two men, SMY approved the loan
                    promptly nonetheless without even discussing the terms of repayment. The Payment
                    Voucher was false in stating that there was a loan from Ren Ci to Mandala. There
                    was no documentation of the loan in Mandala as no loan was made to it, contrary
                    to what was stated in the Payment Voucher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defence argued, however, that there was a
                    “back-to-back” staff loan from Ren Ci to Mandala and from Mandala
                    to RY. If this were the case, the Payment Voucher would not be false. SMY
                    assumed that RY would arrange the necessary documentation. RY’s defence
                    was that he totally forgot to document the loan in Mandala. The defence’s
                    evidence relating to the purpose of the loan was somewhat hazy. It was either
                    for RY to make an urgent payment for his house in Hong Kong pending the approval
                    of his housing loan or was for RY to help a friend in Hong Kong make an urgent
                    payment to some renovation contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The elements of SMY’s First Charge were
                    set out by the DJ in the GD at [189- 191]. For the offence under
                    section 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), the
                    prosecution had to prove that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY was an officer of Ren Ci at the material
                            time;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he acted wilfully with intent to defraud;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">he did so by falsifying the Payment
                            Voucher.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Given that the charge was one of abetment by conspiracy, it was not
                    necessary to show that SMY was the one who gave explicit instructions to falsify
                    the payment voucher; it was sufficient to show that SMY and RY had agreed to the
                    falsification of the Payment Voucher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The DJ found that there was no back to back
                    loan and that Ren Ci did not in fact lend $50,000 to Mandala on 17 May 2004
                    (GD at [148-161]). In particular, when the Cash Cheque for the amount was
                    encashed, the money was given to RY who kept it at home for five days, from
                    17 May 2004 to 22 May 2004, before flying to Hong Kong with it. Thus
                    the money did not go to Mandala at all. There was ample time for RY to document
                    the loan before flying off but he failed to do so. Furthermore, RY was
                    questioned extensively during the recording of his statements on the nature of
                    the loan and had many opportunities to mention that it was a back-to-back loan.
                    Instead, he “confirmed at P16-202 and P17-271 that it was his plan to
                    borrow money from Ren Ci and have it recorded under Mandala’s name”
                    (GD at [150.6]). Therefore, the Payment Voucher which described the $50,000 as a
                    “loan to Mandala” was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The DJ further found that SMY and RY both had
                    the requisite intent to defraud. SMY and RY were aware that the $50,000 was not
                    a loan to Mandala and the description on the Payment Voucher which SMY had
                    signed was false. As mentioned above, RY admitted that he planned to borrow
                    money from Ren Ci and have it recorded under Mandala’s name. SMY never
                    mentioned a back-to-back loan in his 26 and 27 March 2008 statements to the
                    CAD but went back to the CAD to mention the back-to-back loan for the first time
                    on 31 March 2008. However, he had trouble answering when questioned why
                    there was a back-to-back loan since RY was not a staff of either Ren Ci or
                    Mandala (GD at [92]). The DJ further found the explanation as to why RY had
                    allegedly asked for a loan from Mandala instead of Ren Ci to be lacking in
                    credibility. If RY and SMY felt that RY was entitled to a Mandala staff loan as
                    they claimed that he was managing Mandala, they should also have felt that RY
                    was entitled to a Ren Ci staff loan. If so, RY should have asked for a Ren Ci
                    staff loan rather than a Mandala one, since Ren Ci had the funds and had in
                    place an existing practice of granting staff loans and a finance and human
                    resources department to facilitate the granting of the loan (GD at
                    [150.8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The DJ therefore held that the elements of
                    SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge were satisfied, since SMY
                    had agreed with RY concerning the preparation of the false document. Further to
                    this agreement, RY asked for the Payment Voucher to be prepared and SMY signed
                    it, with both knowing that there was in truth no loan to Mandala.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SMY’s Second Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The elements of the Second Charge were laid
                    out by the DJ in the GD at [180] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">180.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">SMY was entrusted with dominion over Ren
                            Ci’s funds, namely the funds in the account from which the $50,000
                            was drawn using the cash cheque.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">180.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">SMY had dishonestly misappropriated the $50,000
                            when he approved the loan of $50,000 to RY.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DJ observed that it was not disputed that
                    SMY was entrusted with Ren Ci’s funds. The DJ further added that, in view
                    of his finding that RY was not entitled to receive a $50,000 loan from Ren Ci or
                    Mandala, the element of misappropriation was satisfied (GD at
                [181-183]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The DJ had earlier found, in the GD at
                    [110]-[140], that RY was not entitled to receive the $50,000 loan from Ren Ci or
                    from Mandala. In particular, RY did not have an employment pass that would have
                    allowed him to work for Ren Ci on 17 May 2004. With regards to Mandala,
                    besides the fact that RY’s lack of an employment pass would have prevented
                    him from being employed by Mandala, Mandala’s accounts revealed that there
                    was only one salaried employee at that time, Ong Keok. RY was not even on
                    Mandala’s payroll. It was also clear that the mandate given to SMY to run
                    Mandala was that it was an investment to generate profits for Ren Ci. This was
                    based on, among other things, minutes of a 7 November 1996 Management
                    Committee meeting which stated that Ren Ci relied on SMY to run Mandala for Ren
                    Ci’s benefit and all profits generated by Mandala would be returned to Ren
                        Ci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The DJ also found that the following evidence
                    supported the prosecution’s case. The manner in which the $50,000 loan was
                    given, in marked departure from the procedure adopted for the previous staff
                    loans given out by Ren Ci, strongly suggested that SMY and RY knew that the
                    granting of the loan was wrong and thought it necessary to hide it from the Ren
                    Ci finance department (GD at [123]-[130]). Contrary to RY’s argument that
                    the lack of documentation was due to the urgent need for the loan, the DJ noted
                    that RY’s behaviour suggested otherwise, in particular the fact that he
                    waited until 22 May 2004 before flying to Hong Kong and depositing the cash
                    in his bank account two days later (GD at [131]-[135]). The lack of a repayment
                    plan also suggested that the loan was not proper (GD at
                [136]-[140]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the element of dishonesty, the DJ held that
                    this requirement was satisfied as SMY knew that by his actions of signing the
                    Cash Cheque and Payment Voucher, RY was obtaining a wrongful gain in the form of
                    $50,000 that he was not entitled to and at the same time, Ren Ci would be, at
                    the very least, temporarily deprived of the money. The DJ therefore found that
                    the elements of the Second Charge were satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge and RY’s Second
                Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The DJ set out the elements of SMY’s
                    Third and Fourth Charges and RY’s Second Charge, in the GD at [192]. I
                    quote:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">192.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">SMY (and RY where appropriate) knowingly
                            provided information to the Commissioner of Charities which was false in
                            a material particular.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">192.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The information was either intended to be used
                            by the Commissioner to discharge his functions under the [Charities] Act
                            (DAC 31696/2008), or that it was provided in purported compliance with
                            the Commissioner’s order of 2 January 2008 (DAC
                            31697/2008).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The DJ found that at the time of these
                    offences, RY had already informed SMY that he was going to use the story that
                    $50,000 had been used to purchase wood and that SMY knew the story and the BJJHS
                    Letter’s contents were untrue (GD at [86], [164-168]). The DJ also found
                    that SMY knowingly provided false information to the Inquiry on 18 December
                    2007, that RY arranged for the preparation of a false document (the BJJHS
                    Letter) and SMY produced this pursuant to the order of the Commissioner, knowing
                    that it was a false document (GD at [193]). Accordingly, the DJ was satisfied
                    that the elements of SMY’s Third Charge and Fourth Charge and RY’s
                    Second Charge were satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The DJ also thought that SMY’s claim
                    that he had forgotten about the loan was not plausible (GD at [177]-[179]). In
                    particular, SMY had given RY a number of supplementary credit cards and kept
                    track of the credit card bills and RY’s repayment of the same. It was
                    therefore odd that SMY was able to do this but could forget about the $50,000
                    loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     After finding that the elements of the charges
                    were satisfied and convicting SMY and RY on their respective offences, the DJ
                    proceeded to consider the sentences to impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In relation to SMY, the DJ noted that the
                    offences involved an abuse of his authority and a betrayal of the trust reposed
                    in him as CEO and Chairman of Ren Ci (GD on Sentence at [23]-[28]). Donors
                    expected their money to be put to good use. When the Inquiry began, SMY made
                    things worse by giving false evidence to the Commissioner of Charities. SMY even
                    gave false evidence under affirmation. The aggravating factors above were
                    balanced against SMY’s record of public service and contributions to
                    society and the effect the conviction would have on his position at Ren Ci and
                    other organizations. The DJ also took into account the fact that SMY was not the
                    beneficiary of the $50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In relation to RY, the DJ considered it
                    significant that RY received a benefit as a result of the offence (GD on
                    Sentence at [29]-[30]). Furthermore, in relation to the provision of the false
                    letter, a custodial sentence was merited since the object of the offence was to
                    cover up wrongdoing. These factors were balanced with the fact that he was a
                    first offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In relation to both SMY and RY, the DJ took
                    into account the fact that such offences affected not just a single charity but
                    all charities, as far as the public’s trust and confidence were concerned.
                    The DJ reasoned that the sentences imposed therefore had to sufficiently deter
                    similar offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The DJ sentenced SMY as follows (GD on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The DJ sentenced RY as follows (GD on Sentence

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No"></div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">RY’s First Charge- 7 months’

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Counsel for SMY argued that the prosecution
                    had failed to establish the following elements beyond reasonable doubt:</p>

                            section 477A of the Penal Code in that there was no proof that RY
                            had the intention to defraud Ren Ci when he requested and made
                            arrangements for the loan;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the Payment Voucher was false, i.e. that the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that on all the facts in the case, an inexorable
                            and irresistible inference should be drawn that SMY had conspired with
                            RY to falsify the Payment Voucher to state that the loan was one from
                            Ren Ci to Mandala, with the intention to defraud Ren Ci.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I shall first address the second argument, followed by the first and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In support of this point, counsel for SMY
                    argued that (i) RY had requested a loan from Mandala, (ii) the Mandala loan was
                    recorded in Ren Ci’s books as a loan from Ren Ci to Mandala, and (iii) the
                    Mandala loan was recorded as part of the total outstanding sum owed by Mandala
                    to Ren Ci in audit confirmations by Mandala to Ren Ci dated 21 June
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> (signed by
                    SMY), 24 April 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    (signed by RY) and 18 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (signed by RY).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Counsel submitted that when RY first
                    approached SMY for a loan on 17 May 2004, he asked to borrow $50,000 from
                    Mandala. SMY was not aware at that point if Mandala had adequate cash to lend
                    the said amount to RY as SMY had never managed Mandala from the start. It was
                    only when RY returned with the Cash Cheque and Payment Voucher for SMY’s
                    approval that SMY realised that Mandala did not have adequate funds to lend RY
                    the $50,000. Therefore, the money had to come from Ren Ci as a loan to
                    Mandala.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, as the DJ noted, the money did not go
                    to Mandala at all. RY kept the cash in his home for five days before flying to
                    Hong Kong and depositing it into his account. RY admitted that his plan was to
                    borrow money from Ren Ci and record it under Mandala’s name. Quite
                    interestingly, in 2007, RY repaid the loan to Ren Ci rather than to Mandala.
                    Moreover, no mention of any back-to-back loan was made in RY’s note to Ren
                    Ci’s finance department.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The evidence indicated that SMY knew that
                    there was no back-to-back loan. SMY did not mention the back-to-back loan in his
                    initial statements to the CAD. SMY had admitted that a back-to-back loan was not
                    a proper way to give a loan to RY.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Further, as the
                    DJ found, the justification by SMY and RY for the loan coming from Mandala,
                    instead of directly from Ren Ci, lacked credibility (GD at
                [150]-[151]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The loan was never recorded in Mandala’s
                    books. Counsel for SMY attempted to explain this glaring inconsistency by
                    pointing to the audit confirmations for Ren Ci. The audit confirmations were
                    stated by Mr Winston Ngan, PW 2, at the trial below<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, to be consistent with the description
                    of the loan as a loan for $50,000 from Ren Ci to Mandala. However, the audit
                    confirmations were consistent with Ren Ci’s accounts but not with those of
                    Mandala. They also stated a global figure without individual breakdowns. Mandala
                    merely confirmed that the global amount owed by Mandala to Ren Ci was correct,
                    even though the alleged loan to RY did not appear in its records. In these
                    circumstances, the audit confirmations could not be said to be evidence of the
                    existence of a back-to-back loan from Ren Ci to Mandala and then to
                RY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is trite law that an appellate court will
                    be slow to interfere with the trial judge’s finding of fact. As Yong Pung
                    How CJ held in <em>Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP</em>
                    [1999] 2 SLR (R)  1108 at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is settled law that an appellate court will defer to the trial judge's
                        finding of fact: see <em>PP v Hla Win</em> [1995]
                        2 SLR(R) 104   at [38]. There is a sound rationale for
                        this. The trial judge enjoys the advantage of observing the demeanours of
                        the witnesses. In deciding who to believe, he takes into consideration all
                        relevant factors involved, with the advantage of his observations. An
                        appellate court therefore does not lightly disturb such findings, unless
                        they can be shown to be plainly wrong, against the weight of the evidence or
                        that the trial judge has not taken proper advantage of his having seen and
                        heard the witnesses: <em>Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v
                            PP</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 253   and <em>Krishna Jayaram v PP</em> [1989]
                        2 SLR(R) 21  .</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the evidence, I see no reason to disturb the DJ’s findings
                    that there was no back-to-back loan and that the Payment Voucher was
                    false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did SMY conspire with RY to falsify the Payment Voucher wilfully with
                the intent to defraud?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The offence of abetment by conspiracy is found
                    in section 107(b) of the Penal Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>107</b>. A person abets the doing of a thing who
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for
                        the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in
                        pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that
                        thing…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The requirements for the offence of abetment by conspiracy were spelt
                    out in <em>Lee Yuen Hong v Public Prosecutor</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 604 at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On a charge of abetment by conspiracy, the Prosecution has to
                        establish the following elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the person abetting must engage, with one or
                                more other persons, in a conspiracy;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the conspiracy must be for the doing of the
                                thing abetted; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(3)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">an act or illegal omission must take place in
                                pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that
                                thing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Proof of an agreement between the parties can
                    be inferred from the words and actions of the parties, as elaborated upon in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 302 at [20]. I quote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and
                        actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common
                        object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have
                        been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not
                        of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of
                        the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The inference of a conspiracy was clarified by Yong CJ in
                        <em>Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2000] 1 SLR(R) 756 at [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So far as proof goes, conspiracy is generally a matter of inference,
                        deduced from certain acts of the accused parties, done in pursuance of an
                        apparent criminal purpose in common between them. Both the surrounding
                        circumstances and the conduct of the parties before and after the alleged
                        commission of the crime will be useful in drawing an inference of
                        conspiracy… An inference of conspiracy would be justified only if it
                        is inexorable and irresistible, and accounts for all the facts of the
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     After examining the evidence in the case at
                    hand, I agree with the DJ’s finding that there was an agreement between
                    SMY and RY to falsify the Payment Voucher. Adopting the test in <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh</em> (above at [40]) to the
                    case at hand, the words and actions of SMY and RY clearly illustrated their
                    “concert in pursuit of a common object or design”, the common
                    object being the falsification of the Payment Voucher. This was evident from
                    RY’s instruction to the finance department to record the 50,000 as a loan
                    to Mandala in the Payment Voucher and SMY’s subsequent authorization of
                    the Payment Voucher. RY’s statement to the CAD confirmed that he gave the
                    instruction to the finance department and that SMY agreed to record the $50,000
                    as a loan to Mandala.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> SMY admitted to the CAD that he knew
                    that the loan was a personal loan to RY when he approved and signed the Cash
                        Cheque.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There could be no doubt that SMY and RY had
                    engaged in the conspiracy wilfully. Furthermore, the DJ found that SMY and RY
                    had the intent to defraud. I agree with the approach adopted by the DJ in
                    following <em>Public Prosecutor v Chow Wai Lam</em>
                    [2006] SGDC 1 at [47]-[52] with respect to the definition of
                    “intent to defraud”. The proper approach should be to examine all
                    the facts and circumstances surrounding the relevant transaction to determine
                    whether or not there was an intent to defraud. Both SMY and RY knew that there
                    was no back-to-back loan and that the loan was a personal one to RY, not a loan
                    from Ren Ci to Mandala. Yet they went on to mask the $50,000 as a loan to
                    Mandala. The intent to defraud was therefore present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Given that (i) SMY and RY engaged in a
                    conspiracy to falsify the Payment Voucher, (ii) SMY and RY did so wilfully and
                    with intent to defraud (as per the requirements of section 477A Penal Code)
                    and (iii) the Payment Voucher was falsified, all three requirements for the
                    offence of abetment by conspiracy, as laid out in <em>Lee Yuen
                        Hong v Public Prosecutor</em> (above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>), were satisfied with respect to the offence under
                    section 477A. I therefore affirm the conviction of SMY and RY in relation
                    to SMY’s First Charge and RY’s First Charge
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">SMY’s Second Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Second Charge involved the offence of
                    criminal breach of trust. This is defined in section 405 of the Penal
                    Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion
                        over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that
                        property, or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of
                        any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be
                        discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made
                        touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person
                        to do so, commits “criminal breach of trust”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Tan Tze Chye v PP</em> [1997]
                    1 SLR(R) 876, Yong CJ stated at [36] that in order to constitute
                    the offence of criminal breach of trust, the accused had to be “(a)
                    entrusted with the property, and he had to have (b) dishonestly misappropriated
                    the property”. Yong CJ added at [37] that to misappropriate means
                    “to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong
                use”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Counsel for SMY argued that the granting of a
                    loan was always a discretionary matter, subject to SMY’s approval, since
                    no one, whether a staff or a volunteer, was entitled to any loan. The Management
                    Committee had unconditionally left authority with SMY to decide whether to grant
                    a loan or not. Thus, SMY’s authority to grant any loan was not affected by
                    RY’s employment status. The size of a loan would not have any bearing on
                    SMY’s authority to grant a loan; rather it would be one of the factors
                    that was relevant when SMY decided whether the loan should be approved or
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Counsel for SMY further argued that the
                    examples of previous loans granted by Ren Ci did not mean that there was a
                    standing policy on loans because no formal policy was in place. Rather, the
                    evidence at trial was that each and every loan by Ren Ci would be considered on
                    a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel for SMY argued that the Management
                    Committee had left the day-to-day affairs of Ren Ci and Mandala entirely to SMY.
                    SMY’s unchallenged testimony at trial was that the Management Committee
                    never had any formal discussion setting out any guidelines for loans to staff
                    nor had the Management Committee talked about any prohibitions on the granting
                    of a loan to a person who, though not a staff, had contributed to Ren Ci. Thus,
                    the Appellant was of the honest belief that he was authorised to grant the
                    loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     SMY’s responsibilities in Ren Ci had
                    increased and he required a personal assistant to help him with his duties here
                    and to travel with him to his many offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan. SMY
                    contended that MOM officials in 2001 had intimated that, even though RY’s
                    application for an employment pass was not approved, if RY’s salary was
                    paid through SMY’s salary, people might just close one eye. This was of
                    course denied by the MOM witness during the trial as MOM officials would not
                    condone infringement of manpower law and would never advise people on how to
                    break the law. In any event, counsel for SMY argued, RY was in substance and in
                    truth an employee of Ren Ci at the time of the loan in May 2004. He was running
                    Mandala, he was openly performing duties as a staff of Ren Ci and his name
                    appeared in the minutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Counsel for SMY further submitted that RY did
                    not ask for a personal loan but requested to borrow money from Mandala to pay
                    for his house in Hong Kong and said he would repay the money once his housing
                    loan was approved. It was ironical that all this had to happen as SMY could have
                    easily raised the money requested from supporters. RY told him that he would
                    record the loan in Mandala’s books but unfortunately did
                not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The lack of any dishonest intention, counsel
                    submitted, was supported by the fact that the loan was recorded in Ren
                    Ci’s accounts and the various audit confirmations. Further, given that SMY
                    was a partner in Mandala and was personally liable for any loans extended by Ren
                    Ci to Mandala, no loss was occasioned to Ren Ci at any time by the granting of
                    the $50,000 loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The DJ rightly observed that the testimony
                    showed that Ren Ci had only granted loans to staff in the form of salary
                    advances and its Human Resources staff had never come across an application by a
                    volunteer for a loan (GD at [19]). Clearly, on the facts, RY was not a staff of
                    Ren Ci at the material time although SMY obviously treated him as one despite
                    the known legal impediment. The fact that RY’s salary had to be paid
                    indirectly through SMY’s increased salary showed that SMY wanted to employ
                    RY even if the law said no. Furthermore, any funds loaned from Ren Ci to Mandala
                    had to be used to run Mandala’s business only. Ms Chan Ching Oi (PW
                    7), the Honorary Secretary of the Management Committee of Ren Ci, confirmed that
                    loans made to Mandala had to be used to sponsor Mandala’s business and was
                    not meant for third parties. Had Ms Chan been aware that the $50,000 was
                    not received by Mandala but by a third party, she would not have approved the
                        loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Therefore there clearly was a
                    misappropriation, as the funds were diverted to the wrong person and for a wrong
                    use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The next element of the offence is the element
                    of “dishonesty”. “Dishonesty” is defined in
                    section 24 of the Penal Code as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one
                        person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing
                        dishonestly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">“Wrongful gain” is defined in section 23 as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not
                        legally entitled</p>
<p class="Judg-1">while “wrongful loss” is defined in the same
                    section as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is
                        legally entitled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I agree with the reasoning of the DJ (GD at
                    [187]) that the element of dishonesty was satisfied as SMY was aware that by
                    signing the Cash Cheque and the Payment Voucher, RY was obtaining a wrongful
                    gain in getting a $50,000 loan that he was not entitled to and Ren Ci was
                    deprived of the money. The following factors strongly suggested that SMY
                    intended to cause gain to RY by unlawful means and loss to Ren Ci by unlawful
                    means:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the $50,000 loan was granted in a manner that was

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the loan was misleadingly stated to be a
                            “Loan to Mandala” on the Payment Voucher;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY attempted to cover up the fact that the
                            $50,000 was given to RY as a loan, through, among other things,
                            providing documents to E &amp; Y in an attempt to show that the $50,000
                            had been used to purchase statues;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY lied to the CAD initially but later admitted
                            that he knew the $50,000 was a personal loan to RY at the time it was
                            made.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Even if an accused intends a misappropriation
                    to be temporary only, this is sufficient to satisfy the element of dishonesty.
                    This was elucidated by Abdoolcader J in <em>PP v Datuk Haji Harun
                        bin Haji Idris</em> [1977] 1 MLJ 180 (and endorsed by Yong
                    Pung How CJ in <em>Lee Yuen Hong v PP</em> at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"[dishon<em>esty in the context of criminal breach of

                        been any intention on the part of the accused to have any permanent gain to
                        himself or cause any permanent loss to the person entitled to the
                            property<em>"</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yong CJ went on to add, at [48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Temporary misappropriations which are seemingly innocuous and do not cause
                        any loss to the employer should not be permitted by the law in any event.

                        <em>at the time the disputed sum was handed over to the
                            appellant</em>, he was nevertheless dishonest at law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, it is immaterial to SMY’s Second Charge that the money
                    was taken and repaid to Ren Ci eventually (and even then, only when the issue of
                    the missing funds was being looked into).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Counsel for SMY pointed out that SMY donated
                    $50,000 to Ren Ci on 30 August 2005 and that RY repaid the loan by paying
                    $10,000 to Ren Ci on 4 January 2007 and another $40,000 on 7 March 2007. In
                    October 2007, SMY was still unaware that the missing $50,000 was in fact the
                    Mandala loan to RY and therefore felt compelled to reimburse RY for the $50,000
                    that he had paid to Ren Ci earlier that year as he thought that RY had to come
                    up with his own money to make good the missing $50,000. SMY felt bad that the
                    money went missing during his watch. SMY therefore gave $50,000 to RY in October
                    2007 because of this. RY took $1,000 in cash and deposited the rest into his
                    account. Counsel therefore asked rhetorically whether SMY’s actions were
                    consistent with a person who wanted to cause wrongful loss to Ren
                Ci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I asked whether this meant that RY was
                    dishonest towards his benefactor and boss because he knew that he was merely
                    repaying his loan and yet accepted the compensation of $50,000 from SMY. Counsel
                    for RY replied that RY did not dare come clean at that point in time because he
                    knew that he had forgotten to record the loan in Mandala’s books and did
                    not want Ren Ci to become another NKF saga.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In my opinion, RY’s explanation for this
                    sounded extremely hollow. There was no indication that his relationship with SMY
                    had changed by 2007 that he would effectively lie to someone so close to him and
                    so concerned for his wellbeing. If it was a mere administrative slip-up and
                    there was nothing surreptitious at all about the loan, surely RY would not be
                    cheating SMY of $50,000 in this manner. What the two men were doing with the
                    fund transfers was something known only to them. After all, their very close
                    relationship extended to financial matters as well. This was amply demonstrated
                    by the joint purchases of the Australian properties early in their relationship
                    and by the provision of supplementary credit cards by SMY for RY. As for the
                    donation in 2005 by SMY, while that is commendable, it does not necessarily
                    follow that a person who donated money to a charity in August 2005 could not
                    have also misused its funds in May 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Further, as alluded to earlier, the repayments
                    by RY to Ren Ci came about only after E &amp; Y had started probing the
                    charity’s financial situation. The repayments were also more than two and
                    a half years after the loan was given in May 2004. Such a scenario surely makes
                    one wonder whether and when the loan would be repaid if no investigations had
                    taken place. Despite RY’s claim that the loan came from Mandala, he
                    nevertheless saw it proper to repay Ren Ci directly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In my view, all these actions by the two men
                    reinforced rather than negated the finding of dishonesty. I have already said
                    that the audit confirmations could not be evidence of the alleged back-to-back
                    loan as the consolidated amount showed no indication that there was such a loan.
                    I therefore agree with the DJ and affirm the conviction in respect of
                    SMY’s Second Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SMY’s Third Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Counsel for SMY argued that while SMY knew the
                    general purpose of the Mandala loan when he granted it on 17 May 2004, he
                    later believed that RY had made repayment sometime in 2004 or 2005 once his
                    housing loan was approved as he trusted RY to do so. The possibility of the loan
                    still being outstanding escaped his mind during the interview with E &amp; Y on
                    18 December 2007. Only in or around January 2008, after RY had informed him of
                    the truth about the loan did it dawn on SMY that the “missing”
                    $50,000 was the Mandala loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before addressing counsel’s arguments,
                    it is necessary to first turn to the law. The Charities Act (the

                    Commissioner of Charities. The objectives of the Commissioner, as spelt out in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Counsel for SMY submitted that 2004 and the
                    following years were an extremely hectic time for SMY. He was personally
                    involved in many fund-raising projects and religious activities and the Mandala
                    loan to RY was completely forgotten by him. I note that SMY had the time to
                    travel to Australia with RY to purchase a penthouse in Melbourne (one of the two
                    properties referred to earlier) in September 2004 despite his busy schedule. As
                    the DJ also pertinently observed, it was not plausible that SMY was able to keep
                    track of RY’s repayment of the credit card bills but could forget
                    altogether about the $50,000 loan. SMY and RY were in close and constant contact
                    with each other concerning work and their personal financial
                matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It was quite incredible that SMY never once
                    asked RY after May 2004 whether he had obtained the Hong Kong housing loan and
                    whether he had repaid the $50,000 or any portion thereof to Mandala. Even if the
                    loan did slip his mind for a while, when the heat of the Inquiry started getting
                    more intense, it was not possible that SMY would not try to recollect what the
                    missing $50,000 could be, by meeting his staff members and/or checking the
                    relevant documents. Further, it must be remembered that in February 2007, Ren Ci
                    had given information to MOH that the said amount was expended on cupboards and
                    fittings. Then in March 2007, Ren Ci gave information to MOH that the missing
                    $50,000 was expended on merchandise, another incorrect assertion. With the story
                    about the $50,000 constantly evolving in the face of a serious query from the
                    authorities, SMY’s seeming indifference and total reliance on what RY told
                    him without verification was completely at odds with someone holding such a
                    responsible position in the charity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I also find it absurd that RY would be so
                    forgetful about documenting such a unique loan of indeterminate duration that he
                    completely forgot to record it in Mandala’s books over the years. After
                    all, there was no evidence that Mandala had so many business activities that
                    RY’s attention was totally diverted away from the loan. If SMY and RY were
                    right in saying that the audit confirmations from Ren Ci included the said loan,
                    then they could not have signed the audit confirmations without remembering the
                    alleged loan to Mandala. I also find it incredible that RY would be so fearful
                    of owning up to a simple administrative error, if error it be, of forgetting to
                    record a loan in the books that he would hide that fact from SMY, someone he was
                    obviously close to professionally and personally. In my view, it was true that
                    SMY and RY were worried about the fallout from the NKF saga but it was in the
                    context of them having misused Ren Ci’s funds for a personal loan (with no
                    repayment or other terms) for someone not entitled to it and their concern that
                    this financial misdeed and blatant breach of employment law would be discovered.
                    Their efforts to plaster over an alleged innocent administrative lapse raised so
                    many questions that they appeared to me to be digging a 20-foot tunnel to bury a
                    small ant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the circumstances, I agree with the DJ that
                    SMY was guilty of the offence under section 10(1)(a) of the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SMY’s Fourth Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Counsel for SMY submitted that SMY was not
                    aware, when the BJJHS Letter was forwarded to E &amp; Y, that the $50,000 was
                    not used to purchase wood from China. RY confirmed that he did not discuss with
                    nor inform SMY that he would be speaking with Zhang Jin Hai (PW 14) to have the
                    BJJHS Letter issued. Zhang Jin Hai confirmed that SMY had no part to play in the
                    issuance of the BJJHS Letter and that he dealt only with RY in relation to the
                    issuance of the BJJHS Letter. There was no evidence of SMY’s participation
                    in any conspiracy for the preparation of the BJJHS Letter. After RY confessed to
                    SMY sometime towards the end of January 2008, SMY agreed to continue RY’s
                    lie on the wood story as he feared that the error on RY’s part in failing
                    to record the $50,000 loan would have a negative impact on Ren Ci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     After SMY provided the oral statement on
                    affirmation to E &amp; Y, Lynda Soong, the Head of the Inquiry, issued an
                        order<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (the
                    “Order”) dated 2 January 2008 under section 8(3) of the Act
                    requesting that SMY produce documents evidencing the valuation of the two
                    statues allegedly bought by Mandala with the $50,000. Pursuant to the Order, E
                    &amp; Y interviewed SMY and received a written statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> by SMY dated
                    4 January 2008 stating that the wood and Buddha statues were purchased from
                    BJJHS in China and that the total cost of the two statues was $16,000 with 25m³
                    of timber left over. SMY was asked to furnish documents in support of this.
                    Sometime in January 2008, E &amp; Y received a letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> on the letterhead of
                    BJJHS addressed to Mandala, stating that two wooden Buddha statues, costing
                    $16,000 in total had been shipped to Singapore on 13 August 2007 and that
                    there was a balance of 25m³ of wood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The law relating to the offence of abetment by
                    conspiracy has been discussed above. There was ample evidence to infer a
                    conspiracy on the part of SMY and RY to knowingly provide E &amp; Y with
                    information that was false in a material particular. RY confessed that it was
                    his idea to come up with the excuse that the $50,000 was used to buy wood and
                    statues from BJJHS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He told the excuse to SMY who agreed
                    to help him with the cover up. According to RY, SMY knew that the letter was a
                    fake but was merely helping RY cover up. SMY admitted furnishing the BJJHS
                    Letter to E &amp; Y and that at the time the documents were submitted, SMY was
                    aware that the statues were not purchased by Mandala.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Thus, the words of SMY and RY indicated
                    concerted action between them in pursuit of a common aim from which a conspiracy
                    could be inferred. The actions of SMY and RY also supported the inference of a
                    conspiracy. Following a request by E &amp; Y to SMY for further documents in
                    support of his written statement dated 4 January 2008, RY approached Zhang
                    Jin Hai who drafted the BJJHS Letter according to RY’s instructions and
                    faxed it to RY. This letter was subsequently provided to E &amp; Y by one of Ren
                    Ci’s staff. The BJJHS Letter contained information that was strikingly
                    similar to what was required by E &amp; Y. This could not have been possible
                    without concerted action between RY and SMY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Pursuant to that conspiracy, the BJJHS letter
                    was handed over to E &amp; Y. As such, all the elements of a conspiracy between
                    SMY and RY to knowingly provide E &amp; Y with information that was false in a
                    material particular were satisfied. The DJ was therefore correct in finding that
                    SMY was guilty of the offence under section 10(1)(b) of the Act as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     My remarks concerning SMY’s Third Charge
                    apply equally to SMY’s Fourth Charge. In my opinion, SMY could not have
                    forgotten about the loan. It follows that all the information that he gave to
                    the Inquiry was provided by him with full knowledge of what the truth was and
                    that the truth was not in the said information. If he realized the falsity of
                    the information only after it had been furnished to the Inquiry, I see no reason
                    why he would not want to rectify the error immediately. After all, it was
                    allegedly a simple administrative slip-up on the part of one of his former staff
                    members. Which of the following is infinitely worse? A slip-up with no loss to
                    the charity (as the loan had been fully repaid by RY by March 2007) or continue
                    a blatant falsehood perpetrated by a former staff member (RY tendered his
                    resignation in June 2007)? For a man of SMY’s status and experience, I
                    have no doubt he would have chosen the correct path if he was truly unaware of
                    the falsehood when he tendered the information. RY was obviously hoping to
                    exonerate SMY from the false information charges under the Act by the much too
                    coincidental assertion that he finally revealed the truth to SMY in late January
                    2008, after SMY had given the false information to the Inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     On the totality of the evidence before me, I
                    agree with the findings of the DJ regarding SMY’s conviction on all four
                    charges and accordingly dismiss SMY’s appeal against conviction. I shall
                    now address RY’s appeal against conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RY’s appeal against conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RY’s First Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Counsel for RY argued that the $50,000 loan
                    was a <em>bona fide</em> loan. RY attempted to cover up the
                    matter only because he had forgotten to record the loan in Mandala’s books
                    and was worried and scared about this omission. RY remembered at all times that
                    he had taken a loan from Mandala. He intended to repay the loan from the
                    proceeds of sale of his shares but as the price of the shares was low, he wanted
                    to wait and repay the entire loan in one payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Counsel further argued that the repayment of
                    $50,000 by SMY to RY in late 2007 (as evidenced by a deposit of
                        $49,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    in RY’s bank account, with RY retaining $1,000 for his use) was evidence
                    of the absence of a conspiracy to falsify the Payment Voucher as it showed that
                    SMY had forgotten that the missing $50,000 was the loan that RY had taken in
                    2004. The fact that RY acknowledged and signed the audit confirmations was
                    indicative of RY’s lack of fraudulent intent with regard to the
                    $50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Furthermore, counsel submitted, the close and
                    personal relationship between RY and SMY would explain why:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY approved the back-to-back loan without much
                            discussion with RY;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY trusted and left it to RY to make the entry
                            in Mandala’s books;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY trusted RY to make repayment of the loan
                            once his housing loan was approved; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY did not track the repayment of the loan as
                            closely as he should have.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As discussed above, I agree with the findings
                    of the DJ that there was no back-to-back loan. Further, the evidence clearly
                    showed that SMY and RY conspired to falsify the Payment Voucher. I have already
                    explained in relation to SMY’s appeal why I did not accept SMY’s and
                    RY’s evidence regarding this offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal against
                    conviction on RY’s First Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RY’s Second Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Counsel for RY argued that RY had stated in
                    his evidence in chief and under re-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that there were material errors in
                    his statements to the CAD<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> on
                    26 March 2008. RY clarified that SMY only knew about the BJJHS Letter at
                    the end of January 2008 and that RY did not inform SMY about the preparation and
                    obtaining of the BJJHS Letter. The formation of the story about the wood only
                    came about sometime in July 2007 and thus it was impossible for RY to have
                    approached SMY concerning the cover up towards the end of 2006 or in the early
                    part of 2007. It was submitted that there was therefore no conspiracy between
                    SMY and RY to cover up the Mandala loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The above points were dealt with by the DJ in
                    the GD at [85]-[86]. The fact that SMY knew about the cover up before he gave
                    the oral statement to E &amp; Y was also consistent with the other facts in the
                    case. Much of what I have stated in respect of SMY’s Third Charge and
                    Fourth Charge applies equally to RY’s Second Charge. I have already stated
                    that I disbelieved that RY would travel so far down the road of falsehood over
                    an allegedly innocent slip-up which had occasioned no loss to the charity. I
                    therefore dismiss the appeal against conviction with respect to RY’s
                    Second Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I now turn to SMY’s and RY’s
                    appeals against their respective sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SMY’s appeal against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev
                    Ed) as it stood before 1 February 2008 applies to this case. Section 477A
                    Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to seven years or fine or both while
                    section 406 Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to three years or
                    fine or both. Section 10(3) of the Act prescribes punishment of a fine not
                    exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.
                    Section 109 Penal Code provides that whoever abets any offence shall, if
                    the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express
                    provision is made by the Penal Code for the punishment of such abetment, be
                    punished with the punishment for the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The sentences imposed on SMY and RY have been
                    set out at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Counsel for SMY argued that the sentence
                    imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive in view of:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SMY’s good character and service to the
                            public; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the contribution by SMY of his time, effort and
                            finances over the past 15 years to start and sustain Ren Ci, a hospital
                            for the needy, chronically ill.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">It was submitted that SMY had a long and distinguished record of
                    public, social and charitable service and had personally helped thousands, if
                    not tens or hundreds of thousands, of Singaporeans who walked through the doors
                    of Ren Ci in the course of his charity and religious work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Counsel also argued that public interest did
                    not demand a custodial sentence. SMY had to endure great embarrassment and
                    trauma due to the publicity generated by the trial. Counsel further argued that
                    even if the court was of the view that a custodial sentence was necessary, in
                    the light of the “clang of the prison gates” principle as applied
                    in <em>Knight v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992]
                    1 SLR 720, a symbolic, short custodial sentence of 1 day would
                    suffice. Counsel submitted that SMY’s work had a much wider direct public
                    outreach and contribution than the type of public service rendered by the
                    appellant in <em>Knight v Public Prosecutor</em>, who, in
                    any event, was legally trained and knew the legal position when he committed his
                    offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Counsel referred to <em>T T Durai v Public Prosecutor</em> [2007] SGDC 334
                    where the accused was tried on one charge under section 6(c) of the
                    Prevention of Corruption Act. There, a district court accepted that the accused
                    worked extensively for the NKF and kidney dialysis patients and that such
                    contributions made by a person to society ought to be taken in the balance
                    because they showed erstwhile good character. Counsel submitted that SMY’s
                    offence of criminal breach of trust was essentially a technical breach of the
                    law and that any imprisonment term imposed on SMY should not be more severe than
                    the 3 months’ imprisonment in <em>T T Durai v Public
                        Prosecutor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     It was further argued that although the funds
                    in Ren Ci came from public donations, a heavy sentence would discourage people
                    from serving on charitable bodies and cause them to choose the more lucrative
                    work in private entities. Moreover, SMY had already seen shame and embarrassment
                    and had to suffer the further indignity of being parodied and ridiculed on
                    stage. Reference was made to <em>Wuu David v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR 83 where Chan Sek Keong CJ
                    said that for one-off offenders, prosecution for the offence would in itself
                    provide some form of general deterrence in most cases and that in some cases,
                    the shame and embarrassment to family and friends could have a more powerful
                    effect than the sentence itself. Counsel submitted that a fine instead of
                    imprisonment could be ordered under section 477A Penal Code and pointed out
                    that the false information charges were actually compoundable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The prosecution argued that the “clang
                    of the prison gates” principle did not apply to SMY as he had used his
                    position of eminence to commit the offences. As stated by Yong CJ in
                        <em>Wong Tiew Yong and Another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2003] 3 SLR(R) 325 at [58]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the fact that [the appellant] had abused this very position of eminence to
                        commit the offences took him out of the exceptional category of persons to
                        whom the principle applies. [The appellant] could not argue that, since he
                        fit this exceptional category very neatly, he could therefore avail himself
                        of the principle. Such an argument mocks the rationale behind the
                        “clang of the prison gates” principle. As a matter of logic,
                        such an argument must fail. A person who had abused his status of eminence
                        to commit an offence should not then be allowed to use that very status to
                        his advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     An appellate court may correct sentences where
                    (a) the sentencing judge has erred as to the proper factual basis for the
                    sentence; (b) the sentencing judge has failed to appreciate the material placed
                    before him; (c) the sentence imposed is wrong in principle and/or law; or (d)
                    the sentence imposed is either manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate:
                        <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR (R)  653 at [13], cited in <em>Whang
                        Sung Lin v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] SGHC 53 at [40]. A
                    sentence is said to be manifestly excessive or inadequate when “the
                    sentence is unjustly lenient or severe, as the case may be, and requires
                    substantial alterations rather than minute corrections to remedy the
                    injustice”:  <em>Public Prosecutor v Siew Boon
                        Loong</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The DJ took into account SMY’s record of
                    public service and contributions to society and acknowledged that in some areas,
                    SMY’s efforts went beyond those of a normal CEO (GD on Sentence at
                    [23]-[28]). However, the DJ also took into account the fact that the offences
                    involved an abuse of authority and a betrayal of the trust placed in SMY as CEO
                    and Chairman of Ren Ci. This has been recognised by the courts as a serious
                    aggravating factor that might outweigh factors which would otherwise go towards
                    mitigation: <em>Balakrishnan S and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 249 at [137]. Furthermore,
                    SMY gave false information in an attempt to cover up the offences which
                    increased the seriousness of the offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I accept that misuse of funds in a charitable
                    organization is a serious offence and that the amount involved in this case was
                    not a small one. There was restitution but only when the authorities began to
                    look into Ren Ci’s financial matters. While no one has the right to demand
                    that SMY live an ascetic life and forego modern facilities, it was certainly not
                    right for SMY to have treated Ren Ci’s funds the way he did in this case.
                    However, it is public knowledge that SMY has risked life and limb in the much
                    publicised efforts to raise funds for Ren Ci. He did not have to perform the
                    dangerous stunts himself but chose to do so nonetheless. The sceptic would of
                    course scoff at his efforts as the manifestation of an egoistic,
                    publicity-seeking man. That would be entirely unfair and unkind. How many among
                    us are willing to undertake those risks to satisfy our egos? If some comment
                    sarcastically that the funds raised were abused by SMY anyway, it must be
                    remembered that what has been proved in this case is that the amount of $50,000,
                    and that amount only, was dispensed as an unauthorised loan. There are
                    outstanding charges against SMY but they are not the subject of this case and
                    have not been proved. I emphasize that I consider the sentences in this case on
                    only the facts adduced here and nothing beyond. I do not think it is disputed
                    that the millions of dollars raised from public donations have been utilised by
                    Ren Ci over the years for poor and chronically ill people.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the sentencing process, the court is
                    sometimes faced with the arduous task of deciding the punishment for a
                    dishonourable act committed by an otherwise honourable person. In William
                    Shakespeare’s <em>Julius Caesar</em>, Mark Antony
                    famously said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The evil that men do lives after them,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The good is oft interred with their bones,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… .</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my opinion, one wrongdoing does not have to be so overwhelming that
                    the many good deeds are completely forgotten and interred with the bones. Even
                    the prosecution has fairly and correctly accepted that SMY did a lot of good for
                    Ren Ci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     While the DJ was correct in noting that the
                    court has to balance the offender’s achievements against the seriousness
                    of the offence (GD on Sentence at [19]), I think he accorded too little weight
                    to SMY’s contributions to society, in particular, the well-being of the
                    poor and chronically ill in Ren Ci. It was essentially a case of criminal breach
                    of trust attended by the related offence of trying to mask the unauthorised loan
                    and later by the offences of giving false information under the Act when the
                    misdeed was being investigated. A custodial sentence is warranted here as there
                    was no admission of the wrongdoing and efforts had been made by both SMY and RY
                    to present a false picture to the authorities. The restitution of the $50,000
                    also came about only after the authorities started looking into Ren Ci’s
                    records. However, an aggregate of 10 months’ imprisonment for SMY, a
                    sentence higher than that imposed on the recipient of the money who obviously
                    was equally involved in the whole episode and whose credentials were nowhere as
                    sterling as SMY’s, appears to me to be manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The false information charges involved the
                    “knowingly” limb rather than the “recklessly” one.
                    They are therefore more serious in nature. However, the culpability for
                    SMY’s Third Charge and for SMY’s Fourth Charge are not really
                    different – both charges concern giving false information under the Act,
                    with the only distinction being the mode of such information. The latter was a
                    continuation of the earlier falsehood. The sentence in respect of SMY’s
                    Third Charge therefore should not be twice that for SMY’s Fourth Charge.
                    Accordingly, I alter the imprisonment term for SMY’s Third Charge from 4
                    months to 2 months, the term imposed by the DJ for SMY’s Fourth
                    Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Further, I order the imprisonment terms for
                    SMY’s Second Charge (4 months) and Third Charge (now 2 months) to run
                    consecutively, making an aggregate of 6 months’ imprisonment. The
                    imprisonment terms for the other two charges (6 months and 2 months
                    respectively) are to run concurrently with the two consecutive terms.
                    SMY’s appeal against sentence is therefore allowed in that the aggregate
                    imprisonment term is now 6 instead of 10 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RY’s appeal against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Counsel for RY submitted that the sentence
                    passed by the DJ was manifestly excessive as he had failed to accord proper
                    weight to the following mitigating factors:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">RY was a first time offender;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">RY contributed significantly to the Buddhist
                            scene in Singapore and other jurisdictions; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">RY’s good character, with several persons
                            having provided letters of character reference attesting to
                        this.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     One has to take into account the fact that it
                    was RY who asked for a loan and received a benefit as a result of the offence.
                    He and SMY then tried to cover up the wrongdoing. But for the investigations
                    into Ren Ci’s accounts, one wonders whether or when the loan would be
                    repaid to Ren Ci. While RY was convicted on only two charges, the evidence
                    showed that he was actively and completely involved in the wrongdoing and
                    attempted cover-up from beginning to end. He was also instrumental in getting
                    the untrue BJJHS Letter even after his resignation from Ren Ci. Moreover,
                    RY’s contributions to Ren Ci and to society paled in comparison with
                    SMY’s. In view of these factors, it could not be said that the aggregate
                    imprisonment term of nine months imposed by the DJ was unjustly severe. I
                    therefore dismiss RY’s appeal against sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Finally, I thank all counsel involved in
                    these appeals for their very helpful written and oral submissions.</p>
