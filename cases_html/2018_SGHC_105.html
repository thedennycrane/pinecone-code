In that email, Mr Gattie explained that the defendant had faced “significant setbacks” as a result of their main investor pulling out at the “last minute”. Mr Gattie also apologised, stating that the defendant was “regrettably not in a position to make payment on [its] outstanding dues to [the plaintiff]”. He however expressed optimism at finding another investor for the company, stating that they would “conclude this transaction within 8 weeks”. He then assured the plaintiff that the defendant was “doing everything within [its] power to make payment within the next 8 weeks”. Furthermore, he requested that the plaintiff let him know “the cost of funds that may be associated with an 8 week deferment of payment”.

I should mention that the defendant initially applied for an adjournment to file a summons to enjoin the winding up on the basis of the defences at [10]. I explained, as did the judge who granted parties a previous adjournment, that filing a fresh application for an injunction was not necessary. The purpose of such an injunction is to forestall a winding up application where none has been filed, as such action carries the need for advertisement and may adversely affect the reputation and the business of the debtor company. It gives effect to the policy consideration that “the commercial viability of a company should not be put in jeopardy by the premature presentation of a winding-up petition against it” where there is a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> dispute over the debt: <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 at [82]. In this case, the winding-up application having been filed, the defendant needed only to establish a triable issue in order to obtain a stay or dismissal. This it did not do, and I explain why by dealing with each of the arguments in turn below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there a </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> dispute as to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the underlying debt?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The defendant’s first two arguments raised an underlying dispute.

</div>
</div> For the reasons that follow, I was of the view that this dispute over the debt was neither substantial nor <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 First, these allegations were raised extremely late in the day, and in all the circumstances, lacked credibility. In fact, the defendant had ceded liability on these issues on multiple prior occasions, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) through partial payments by the defendant of some $2,608,357.93 in February and March 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) on 11 July 2017, during a meeting where details of payment and an instalment plan were discussed; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) in an email dated 12 July 2017 that admitted the sum and also promised to compensate the plaintiff for its “cost of funds” for the delay;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) in an undated letter using the defendant’s letterhead which referenced the 11 July 2017 meeting;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) in a 25 August 2017 email where Mr Gattie asked for an instalment plan;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) through another partial payment of $200,000 by a cheque dated 4 September 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) in an email on 16 November 2017, after the statutory demand was issued;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) furnishing a cheque dated 4 September 2017 for $3,000,000 on 17 November 2017; and finally,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the sum of $4,573,300.03 in the statutory demand was used as the basis for the instalment plan which was attached to the plaintiff’s 21 November 2017 letter. The defendant did not refute the items within the instalment plan until after the commencement of the winding-up action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Within the context of these multiple concessions, only one of these alleged breaches was brought to the plaintiff’s attention, sometime in July 2017. This was the claim, mentioned at [12](d) above, that the wall panels and floor of the offices at level 13 of 140 Robinson Road were infested with wood boring beetles. This was not a meritorious contention because the plaintiff was not contractually required by the plaintiff to use treated wood, or to conduct pest control treatment.

</div> It was not at all surprising that – although it underlines the tenuous nature of this defence - the defendant did not even attempt to estimate the quantum of damages that it would have been entitled to under this potential counter-claim if it were to be pursued. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the plaintiff need to commence action under SOPA? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The defendant further claimed that it was an abuse of the winding-up regime for the plaintiff to bring the present application rather than to seek an adjudication under SOPA. It submitted that the plaintiff was “seeking to enforce a disputed debt under the guise of the [d]efendant’s inability to pay debts…”

</div> This second contention was but a variant of the first issue. There was no triable issue in respect of the debt mentioned in the statutory demand, and because of that, there was no need for the plaintiff to commence a claim of any sort.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the statutory demand superseded by a settlement agreement?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendant’s contention that the statutory demand had been “superseded” by a later agreement between parties was not supported by the use of specific authorities or legal arguments on the criteria or mechanics of how the statutory demand had been superseded. Counsel framed their arguments in contractual terms at the hearing. The defendant essentially contended that a new agreement had released it from the statutory demand, while the plaintiff contended that either there was no such agreement or that he had reserved his rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In this context, I consider here whether, as permitted by s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act, the debt had been compounded “to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor”. The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Bombay Talkies (S) Pte Ltd v UOB Ltd</span> [2016] 2 SLR 875 (“<span class="font-italic">Bombay Talkies</span>”) on this issue, at [8], was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, to compound a debt connotes the acceptance of an alternative obligation in lieu or in satisfaction of the debt in question. To put it another way, a debt is compounded <span class="font-italic">when it is discharged or rendered unenforceable pursuant to an agreement between the debtor and the creditor</span>. In such circumstances, it will frequently be the case that a new obligation is created and this will be the consideration for the discharge of the original debt; but that is a separate matter which will have to be separately pursued by the creditor in the event of a breach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 With this framework in mind, I turn to consider the correspondence.

If so, a second arises: whether its terms contained a discharge of the defendant’s liability. While both parties referred to their “Settlement Agreement” in their affidavits, both had a different understanding of where that agreement was to be found and what were its terms. The defendant’s position was that settlement was reached on 16 November 2017 by the exchange of emails. The plaintiff, on the other hand, seemed to advance three different positions as to this agreement. Firstly, its solicitors’ letter of 10 January 2018 suggested that the settlement was reached on 21 November 2017, in a letter where the plaintiff had expressly reserved his rights.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Ong Kian Chuan’s affidavit dated 16 January 2018 at p 136.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Secondly, Mr Ong stated at paragraph 21 of his first affidavit that the plaintiff and defendant “entered into a Settlement Agreement” on 16 November 2017. Finally, at the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff contended that no agreement had been reached at all. Whether an agreement was formed and if so, the date the agreement was formed and what it contained are, however, legal issues premised upon an objective assessment of the facts and I explain below my findings on the issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning therefore to the first question, the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”), at [47], that an offer “must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted”, while an acceptance is a “final and <span class="font-italic">unqualified</span> expression of assent to the terms of an offer” [emphasis added]. In other words, there must be a “precise correspondence between offer and acceptance”, because “any qualification of the terms of the original offer renders the offeree’s response a counter-offer, which destroys the original offer and simultaneously constitutes a new offer that can be either accepted or rejected by the original offeror”: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”) at para 03.104. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Applying these principles, it is clear that Mr Gattie’s purported acceptance on 16 November 2017 did not match the terms of Mr Ong’s email. In particular, no guarantor was offered. And Mr Gattie well knew that he was still negotiating, as he headed his email “without prejudice”. Thus the agreement was not concluded, as the defendant contended, with Mr Gattie’s email of 16 November 2017. As for the plaintiff’s position as to the agreement, its reply letter dated 21 November 2017 did not match the terms of Mr Gattie’s email of 16 November 2017 either. While the 21 November 2017 letter no longer demanded a guarantor for the cheque, it contained a fresh term as to two retention sums which were to be settled by 31 July 2018. This reply therefore constituted a new offer from the defendant to the plaintiff. There is no record that this 21 November 2017 letter was accepted. The letters, therefore, do not show matching offer and acceptance. Where counter-offers are constantly made, no contract can be concluded because “each counter-offer destroys the original offer and itself constitutes a new offer”: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> at para 03.107. Hence, it is not entirely clear from the correspondence that as at 21 November 2017, there was truly any settlement agreement to speak of. It could well be, however, that there was oral acceptance or acquiescence by conduct on the part of the defendant with this letter of 21 November 2017 either before or after 21 November 2017. This would explain why the plaintiff waited until 3 January 2018 after issuing the 21 November letter. And this was the position taken by the plaintiff in its letter of demand of 10 January 2018. With that possibility in mind, I turn to its terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Paragraph 5 of the 21 November 2017 letter contains an important caveat. This is that legal action would be taken if the cheque did not clear by 3 January 2018. This clearly set a condition precedent to the new agreement taking effect, which was that the $3,000,000 cheque must clear by 3 January 2018. The effect of such a condition precedent is that the agreement would not take effect until the fulfilment of the stated condition: <span class="font-italic">Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 30 at [19]. Thus, any argument that the debt had been discharged and a new obligation created could only be mounted <span class="font-italic">if the </span><span class="font-italic">$3,000,000 cheque cleared</span>. Since the Defendant’s cheque did not clear by the stipulated date, the condition precedent was not met, and the purported agreement would not have taken effect in any case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff’s position, moreover, on paragraph 5 was that it included an express reservation of its rights; thus, the letter merely granted an indulgence to the defendant to pay and was not an acceptance of the terms set out in the 16 November 2017 email. I agreed with the plaintiff, holding that on a true construction of the letter, the warning that “[w]e will not hesitate to take the necessary legal action” was sufficient to reserve the plaintiff’s right to resuscitate the statutory demand. In particular, what was clear was that there was no agreement to discharge or render unenforceable the debt, as required by <span class="font-italic">Bombay Talkies</span> at [8].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I considered, in this context, the more overt references to the creditors’ right to institute winding-up or bankruptcy proceedings against the defaulting debtors in the contracts in <span class="font-italic">Bombay Talkies</span> (at [4]) and <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Mohandas </span><span class="font-italic">Nagrani v United Overseas Bank Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 174 (at [38]). In the first case, the bank specifically mentioned the possibility of “instituting winding up”. In the second case, which was relied upon by the plaintiff as an example where a creditor had successfully reserved his rights, the bank specifically referred to the institution of bankruptcy proceedings. While the plaintiff’s letter of 21 November 2017 reserved the plaintiff’s rights in more layman terms than the respective banks in the two cases, it was, to my mind, sufficient to put the point across: that the plaintiff was merely granting an indulgence to the defendant to give it time to pay, and whatever legal weaponry that was available to the plaintiff would be utilised without hesitation if the defendant were to default. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In coming to this conclusion, I considered the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the intended effect of its decision in <span class="font-italic">Bombay Talkies</span> at [16] to be instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We make a further observation. The view that we have taken today will have the salutary effect of encouraging creditors who have included the necessary protective language in their agreements to afford debtors the opportunity to pay by instalments so that deserving debtors may avoid having to be wound up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 This rationale applies with good sense in this factual context. Winding up carries serious consequences for a debtor. A creditor who is willing to give a deserving debtor time to pay or the indulgence of payment by instalments ought not to be lightly said to have foregone his rights where he has expressly reserved these rights. Similar considerations undergird the principle applied in <span class="font-italic">Foakes v Beer</span> (1884) 9 App Cas 605 and <span class="font-italic">In re Selectmove Ltd</span> [1995] 1 WLR 474, that a promise to accept part payment cannot found a fresh contract to discharge a larger debt for want of consideration, unless the promisor receives some additional benefit. Although the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [102]–[103] left open the question of the extent to which these cases are part of Singapore law, this does not detract from the point being made here. This is that indulging a debtor with more time while accepting part payment – in this case, a mere chimera of future part payment –  ought not to be too easily regarded as discharging full payment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has the defendant shown that it was solvent?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Finally, a debtor may seek to rebut the presumption of insolvency under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act by showing that the company was in fact solvent: see <span class="font-italic">Export-Import Bank of India v Surya Pharmaceutical (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 258 at [14]; <span class="font-italic">Starluck Construction Pte Ltd v HSS Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2013] SGHC 72 at [7] (“<span class="font-italic">Starluck Construction</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendant sought to show that it was solvent.

</div>
</div> Nevertheless, there was absolutely no evidence that the defendant’s operations were worth around $6–10 million. The letter from Herbert Smith reflected only instructions from the defendant and was dated 23 February 2018, the date Mr Gattie’s affidavit was filed. No potential investor was mentioned in Herbert Smith’s letter. Nor were any letters or any documents or emails evincing interest from any investors exhibited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In this case, the plaintiff first sought to use the presumption of insolvency under s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Companies Act and the defendant sought to rebut it. In answering the defendant’s contentions as to its solvency, the plaintiff supplied evidence that the defendant was in fact insolvent. Although the parties did not address the requirements of s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act before me, the evidence suggests that the plaintiff may have been able to rely on that provision as well. On this issue, the plaintiff pointed out that two primary indicia of a company’s solvency were (i) a cash flow test, the ability to meet demands for debts that have become due; and (ii) a balance sheet test, which is premised on an excess of liabilities over assets.

</div> In this case both tests were met in view of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant did not pay its debts despite several demands from the plaintiff to do so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The net liabilities of the defendant exceeded its net assets by $635,434 in the financial year ending 31 December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The prospects of fresh capital were too speculative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  While there is no single test for insolvency and a court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, these factors are in line with the various criteria set out by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Chip Thye Enterprises Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Phay Gi Mo and others</span> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 434 at [17]-; [19]; and [20]. [19] is of particular relevance to the case at hand:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question to ask is “when was the company unable to pay its debts as they fell due?” It is to be answered by focusing on the company’s financial position taken as a whole by reference to whether a person would expect that at some point the company would be unable to meet a liability. The various tests such as quick assets test, balance sheet test or cash flow test are all different measures of solvency and depending on the facts of the case, one test or a combination of tests may or may not be found to be appropriate. A surplus or deficiency of net assets is indicative but not necessarily determinative in establishing whether or not an entity is able to pay all its debts as and when they become due and payable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For the foregoing reasons, and upon confirmation by the Official Receiver that the papers were in order and that she had no objection to the application, the application was granted.
