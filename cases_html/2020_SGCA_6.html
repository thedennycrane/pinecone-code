The genesis of the application lies in the 13 extensions of time (“EOT”) sought and granted during the course of a preliminary inquiry conducted under the disciplinary framework of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellant, Dr Lee Pheng Lip Ian (“the Appellant”), operated a private clinic by the name of Integrated Medicine Clinic (“the Clinic”). The Clinic had been offering some services which were alleged to be in contravention of the relevant regulations. When the Clinic’s licence was due for renewal, the Ministry of Health (“the MOH”) refused to renew the Clinic’s licence unless the Clinic complied with the relevant regulations. The MOH also referred the matter to the Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”). A Complaints Committee (“CC”) was subsequently appointed to carry out a preliminary inquiry. The inquiry took close to four years. At the end of the inquiry, the CC concluded that a formal inquiry before a Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) should be held. During the course of conducting the preliminary inquiry, the CC sought 13 extensions of time (“EOTs”), all of which were granted by the chairman of the Complaints Panel (“Chairman of CP”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the proceedings in the High Court, the Appellant sought a number of orders, all with the aim of putting an end to the disciplinary process that has been instituted to inquire into the complaints made against him. The Appellant’s case before us is not substantially different from the one below. The crux of the Appellant’s case is as follows. The CC’s inquiry exceeded the statutory deadline of three months. Of the 13 EOTs sought and granted, eight were applied for after the expiry of the extended deadlines and six were said to bear no rational connection to the basis on which the EOTs were sought. It was alleged that the CC and the Chairman of CP did not comply with the relevant provisions of the MRA. As a result of these lapses, the Appellant’s Clinic lost its licence and he suffered financial prejudice.

</div> As some of the EOTs were applied for and granted out of time (in that they were applied for and granted after the expiry of the extended period) and the CC and the Chairman of CP did not satisfy the statutory reasons for the application and the grant of the EOTs, the disciplinary process must be put to an end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Judge stated that the MRA does not stipulate a long-stop date by which a CC has to complete its inquiry. Although he accepted that the intent behind s 42(1) and (2) was for inquiries to be completed expeditiously, he did not think that the CC’s failure to seek EOT before the deadline led to the disproportionate consequence that the CC could no longer continue its inquiry. Similarly, he held the view that Parliament did not intend for the inadequacy of a CC’s reasons for applying for EOT to invalidate the CC’s application for EOT or the grant of EOT by the Chairman of CP. In his opinion, applications for and grants of such EOT under s 42(2) cannot be challenged on the grounds of illegality and irrationality. It follows that EOT applications and grants cannot be challenged under the precedent fact principle of review.

The Judge assumed that the CC and Chairman of CP had not complied with the relevant provisions of the MRA for the purpose of his analysis (see [38] of the Judgment). Having considered the case before him on this basis, the Judge decided that the case was unmeritorious and thus denied leave. The inferences drawn were based on the documentary evidence and there would be little room for dispute. We do not think that such an approach is objectionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is also not uncommon that an application for leave in judicial review proceedings is disposed of on its merits even at the leave stage. Sometimes, this happens because all the parties involved consent to a hearing on merits in order to save time and costs. Indeed, where all relevant parties and information are before the Court and the parties are prepared to make full arguments, the distinction between the leave and the merits stages becomes artificial. In the High Court hearing in this case, the parties filed affidavits and the arguments took place over some two and a half days.

</div> He argued that the consequence of non-compliance of s 42(2) is that the disciplinary proceedings must end. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The issue of statutory non-compliance is a facet of the ground of illegality. Substantive illegality concerns the lack of legal authority or jurisdiction to hear a matter or to exercise a power. Where statutory non-compliance deprives the public body of legal authority altogether, the decision is rendered invalid in law. This would include cases where the adjudicating body is not properly constituted in law, for example, where a member is not qualified to sit in that adjudicating body. The other aspect of illegality is procedural illegality. This pertains to non-compliance with the process set out by law for the orderly conduct of a matter. Here, the inquiry is often about whether the procedure that has been breached is a mandatory or a merely directory one and, if directory, whether any prejudice is suffered by the party in question. The pivotal issue in each case is whether justice has been done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Appellant argued that the Judge was wrong to adopt the mandatory-directory distinction in his analysis of s 42(2) of the MRA. The Appellant contended that this binary distinction led the Judge to conclude that the applications by the CC for, and the decisions by the Chairman of CP to grant, EOTs under s 42(2) cannot be reviewed.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We agree with the Respondents. The mandatory-directory distinction is merely a manifestation of the broader question of whether non-compliance affects the validity of an act or decision. This Court has on several occasions clarified that the various “tests” or “approaches” adopted in the cases all go towards the central and ultimate question of determining what Parliament intended the consequences of non-compliance to be, in particular, whether non-compliance invalidates an act or decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 597, this Court stated that (at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We do not think that the Judge was wrong in drawing an analogy between the mandatory/directory classification and the jurisdictional/non-jurisdictional classification. All he meant to say was that the modern approach is to consider whether it is the intention of Parliament to invalidate an act done in breach of a statutory provision. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Chai Choon Yong v Central Provident Fund Board and others </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 594 (“<span class="font-italic">Chai Choon Yong</span>”), this Court similarly stated that (at [45]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was not wrong of Ang J to draw guidance from the above test. There is no real conflict between Lord Woolf’s approach and Bennion’s. Lord Woolf disapproved of the mandatory/directory dichotomy only in so far as it focused merely on determining whether the words like “shall” or “may” were used. His exhortation to also consider the Legislature’s intention is sound, as it advocates a more holistic and flexible approach to statutory interpretation. The three questions he posed sprang from his overall focus on the intended consequences of any irregularity. They were not meant to be a rigid test, as Lord Woolf himself qualified that the questions to be considered will depend upon the facts of the case. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The court is therefore effectively engaging in an exercise of statutory interpretation of the relevant statutory provision in its attempt to decipher what Parliament’s intention was in respect of the consequences of non-compliance. In the process, the court also considers whether there has been substantial compliance or whether it was a case of egregious breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Section 42(2) is silent on the consequences of non-compliance. We agree with the Judge that it would not serve any purpose to interpret s 42(2) to mean that non-compliance would invalidate a CC’s application for EOT or the Chairman of CP’s grant of EOT. This is because if an application for EOT is invalidated in this manner, the same complaint could be placed before a newly constituted CC, with the result that the disciplinary process is prolonged and the existing delay is exacerbated. In our judgment, non-compliance with s 42(2) does not lead to the result contended for by the Appellant. However, as discussed below, we do not think there was non-compliance with s 42(2) on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Time within which an EOT must be applied for </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Both ss 42(1) and (2) of the MRA seek to ensure that complaints are processed expeditiously. Section 42(1) directs a CC to complete its inquiry within three months but the period for completion may be extended under s 42(2) due to the complexity of the matter or the serious difficulties encountered by the CC in conducting its inquiry. When the Medical Registration Bill 1997 (No. 2 of 1997) was introduced in 1997, Parliament intended to “improve the inquiry process so that complaints can be processed expeditiously”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (25 August 1997) vol 67 at cols 1562–1563 (Yeo Cheow Tong, Minister for Health). In our opinion, s 42(1) and (2) serve the public interest in several aspects. It ensures that valid complaints against errant medical practitioners are dealt with swiftly. Where the complaints come from patients or their families who have suffered from some malpractice or misconduct, the swift outcome in the disciplinary process assuages their suffering and gives some closure. The swift outcome also ensures that an errant or an incompetent medical practitioner receives due punishment and in serious cases, is suspended or even not permitted to practise any more so that further harm to the public is stopped. It also benefits medical practitioners that complaints made against them are determined swiftly to minimise the likely anxiety and distraction that accompany the disciplinary process. This is particularly important if the complaint is eventually dismissed and the medical practitioner is found not guilty of any malpractice or misconduct because his reputation and competence may be in question as a result of a complaint.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Appellant argues that the EOT was invalid because, on eight occasions, the CC applied for EOT after the expiry of the extended periods and were therefore out of time. He pointed out two instances where the applications for EOT were described by him as “flagrant non-compliance”. The second EOT application was made on 30 January 2015, 84 days after the expiry of the first extended period. The third EOT application was made on 19 June 2015, 43 days after the expiry of the extended period.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Appellant contended that the long delay resulting from the various applications for EOT significantly undermines the legislative intent behind ss 42(1) and 42(2) which was to ensure that the CC’s inquiry would not last more than three months or, if extended, a reasonable time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Section 53 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, Rev Ed 1999) provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Construction of power of extending time</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">53.</span> Where in any written law a time is prescribed for doing any act or taking any proceeding and power is given to a court or other authority to extend the time, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised by the court or other authority although the application for the extension is not made until after the expiration of the time prescribed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There is nothing in s 42(2) of the MRA to suggest that the CC must apply before the expiry of the stipulated or the extended period or that the Chairman of CP’s power to grant EOT cannot be exercised after the expiration of the same. We think therefore that the CC may apply for EOT after the initial or the extended deadline to complete its inquiry and the Chairman of CP may grant such applications for EOT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For completeness, s 27 of the Interpretation Act provides that “where a written law confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as occasion requires”. There is therefore also no impediment to the Chairman of CP exercising his power to grant EOT on successive occasions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Additionally, unlike s 86(3) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”), the MRA does not stipulate a final deadline which cannot be further extended. During the Second Reading of the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill (Bill 22 of 2009) on 11 January 2010, a suggestion was made to set a “time-frame” for the complete processing of complaints: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (11 January 2010) vol 86 at cols 1946–1948 (Ang Mong Seng, Member of Parliament). The then Minister for Health agreed that all complaints should be deal with speedily but did not take up the suggestion of a “time-frame”. Instead, he reiterated that there are provisions to limit the time taken by CCs and that the SMC may vary the time for a CC to complete its inquiry: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (11 January 2010) vol 86 at cols 1954–1955 (Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for Health). Parliament did not thereafter legislate a long-stop date or set a definite “time-frame” by which a CC has to complete its inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The conclusion to be drawn from the above discussion is that the three-month period stipulated in s 42(1), when read alongside s 42(2), is not to be understood as a strict imperative for which non-compliance would result in invalid proceedings. Instead, the timelines are directory, expressing Parliament’s general expectation that complaints will be processed expeditiously. We conclude therefore that applications for and the grant of EOT made after the expiry of the initial stipulated period or the extended periods are permissible and do not invalidate the disciplinary proceedings so that they can no longer continue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasons for the application and the grant of EOT</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  The MRA puts in place a largely self-regulated disciplinary process for the medical profession. The Chairman of CP is tasked with supervising the inquiry process. Section 42(2) of the MRA takes into account the practical realities of such a self-regulated disciplinary regime involving CC members who have other professional responsibilities. Each CC may also have to inquire into complaints against more than one medical practitioner. It is therefore necessary that s 42(2) affords a CC the recourse to apply for EOT and confers on the Chairman of CP the discretion to extend the timeline for the completion of a CC’s inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Section 42(2) of the MRA does not create an independent right for the medical practitioner who is the subject of a complaint to challenge the procedural decisions taken by the CC and the Chairman of CP. The CC’s applications for EOT are made to the Chairman of CP without the need to notify the medical practitioner. When making his decision, the Chairman of CP does not have to seek the medical practitioner’s views nor even notify him about the grant of EOT. The medical practitioner has no right to be heard on whether EOT should be granted by the Chairman of CP and it follows that he should not have the right to object to EOT, whether in principle or in length of extension, if it is granted. Section 42(2) therefore regulates the relationship between the CC and the Chairman of CP where the Chairman of CP is the decision maker in the supervision of the timelines of the inquiry. Further, complexity of a matter and serious difficulties are matters of degree and of judgment, dependent very much on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Viewed in this light, the requirements under s 42(2) should not be understood as a strict legislative imperative for which non-compliance results in the invalidation of the CC’s inquiry or the Chairman of CP’s exercise of discretion to grant EOT. We therefore agree with the Judge that non-compliance with s 42(2) does not furnish any ground for judicial review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The CC’s decision to apply for EOT or the Chairman of CP’s exercise of discretion to grant EOT is not completely unfettered despite the presence of the words “may grant such extension of time to the [CC] as he thinks fit” in s 42(2). If the discretion is shown to have been exercised in bad faith or with malice, it may be invalidated. However, to the extent that the criticism is that the CC or the Chairman of CP did not state expressly the statutory grounds (complexity of the matter or serious difficulties encountered) mentioned in s 42(2) in its applications or in the grant of EOT, we do not think this alone gives ground for judicial review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Appellant’s major contention in this case was that the CC did not state expressly in the EOT applications that the matter before it was complex or that it was facing serious difficulties in conducting its inquiry. Neither did the Chairman of CP state expressly the reasons for his decision to grant the EOTs. The Appellant alleged therefore that the CC really had no justification for seeking the 13 EOTs which caused the inquiry to take almost four years to complete.

For the present case, we proceed on the basis that “bad faith” and “lack of good faith” bear the same meaning in the Appellant’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Much as we sympathise with the Appellant on the length of time taken in the inquiry, we disagree that bad faith was proved on the facts of this case. Looking at the exchange of emails between the CC and the Chairman of CP, the CC did provide reasons for the need for EOT. From the relevant emails dated 8 July 2014 to 12 December 2017,

</div>
</div>
</div> it could be seen that the CC was faced with multiple complaints to inquire into at the material time. In some of the emails, the CC informed the Chairman of CP that the investigation unit required more time to complete its investigations. In April 2015, the SMC received “additional information” from the MOH regarding the Appellant’s prescription of BHRT (see [13] above). This would have enlarged the scope of the Complaint that the CC had to inquire into and consequently take up more time. In response to each request for EOT, the Chairman of CP sent his approval to the SMC. While he did not mention his reasons for granting EOT, he reproduced the CC’s emails requesting EOT. Bearing in mind these emails are essentially an internal set of communications, it could be reasonably inferred that he applied his mind to and agreed with the reasons stated in the various requests. While reciting the statutory formula of “complexity of the matter or serious difficulties” provided in s 42(2) in each application for and grant of EOT may help to show that both the CC and the Chairman of CP were aware of the grounds for EOT, the absence of mention of the statutory formula in the correspondence does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that s 42(2) was forgotten or ignored in the process of applying for and granting of EOT. The Court looks at the substance of what was said and done, not the mere perfunctory regurgitation of statutory provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 We mentioned s 68 of the MRA at [51] above. The section provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">No action in absence of bad faith</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">68.</span> No action or proceedings shall lie against the Medical Council, a Complaints Committee, a Disciplinary Tribunal, the Health Committee or any other committee appointed by the Medical Council or any member or employee thereof for any act or thing done under this Act unless it is proved to the court that the act or thing was done in bad faith or with malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the High Court hearing, the Respondents argued in their written submissions that the Appellant in his application for leave for judicial review must also prove that the acts of the CC, the Chairman of CP and the SMC were done in bad faith or with malice. However, this contention was not expanded on during oral submissions and the Appellant did not respond on this point. Accordingly, although the Judge expressed doubt that s 68 precludes or limits the commencement of judicial review proceedings, in the absence of full arguments from the parties and in the light of what he had decided elsewhere in his judgment, he declined to say more about s 68.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the Appellant’s Case, the Appellant pointed out that the Judge had already dismissed a similar argument in an earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2016] 4 SLR 192 (at [44] to [49]) which was cited to the Judge in the present case. In that earlier decision involving the LPA, the Judge held that a review committee’s findings and decisions were susceptible to judicial review notwithstanding s 106 of the LPA which is materially similar to s 68 of the MRA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On a plain reading of s 68 of the MRA, it is at least arguable that the commencement of any action or proceedings under the MRA is limited to the grounds of bad faith or malice. As mentioned earlier, the Appellant made assertions of “bad faith” or “lack of good faith” to justify his contention that the disciplinary process should be invalidated, although he did not expressly confine his case exclusively to these assertions. The Judge’s ruling in the earlier decision concerns another statute although the provision in question is in materially similar terms to s 68 of the MRA. However, as s 68 was not the focus of the arguments before us and is not material to this judgment, we reserve our decision on its effect until an appropriate case comes before us.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Substantial prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Appellant argued that his livelihood was destroyed as a result of the delay caused by the CC and the Chairman of CP because the MOH’s decision not to renew the Clinic’s licence depended on the SMC’s deliberations.

On 19 August 2013, the Ministry wrote to [the Appellant] to inform that the clinic license would be renewed for 6 months from 09 Sept 2013 to 08 March 2014 subject to the licensing conditions that BHRT would not be carried out at [the Clinic]. [The Appellant] was also required to provide a letter of undertaking, he also appealed to be allowed to continue BHRT for existing patients as it would not be fair and safe to his patients to stop receiving treatment abruptly. … The Ministry acceded to [the Appellant]’s request on the condition that [the Appellant] has to justify its continued use with proper documentation of his clinical assessments. Specifically, [the Appellant] has to document his efforts to wean the patients off BHRT. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 [The Clinic] was given four cycles of 6 license periods between 09 Mar 2013 to 16 Mar 2015 as the Minstry [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] was monitoring the clinic’s compliance with the Licensing conditions closely. Despite the Ministry’s reminders over the past 2 years, the Ministry still found [the Appellant] continuing to prescribe BHRT inappropriately. The latest inspections on 10 Feb 2015 and 09 Mar 2015 showed that Dr Lee did not exhibit intention to wean his patients off BHRT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Appellant was informed that the services offered by the Clinic would affect the Clinic’s licence renewal in 2013. However, it was only in 2015 that the MOH refused to renew the Clinic’s licence. Despite having enjoyed the short conditional renewal of the Clinic’s licence, the Appellant refused to temporarily cease the services which were the cause of MOH’s concern. The Appellant was also given the opportunity to continue BHRT with his existing patients until treatment could be stopped safely. It was also not the case that the Appellant was denied any chance of challenging the characterisation of the services he offered as “non-mainstream” or the appropriateness of BHRT. The Appellant corresponded with the MOH continually and even appealed to the Minister. It would have been reasonable for the Appellant to adjust his business to suit the requirements of the relevant regulations until such time when his challenge could be fully ventilated. The Appellant would have been able to continue with his practice. In the circumstances, the CC, the Chairman of CP and the SMC could not be blamed for the alleged prejudice arising from the non-renewal of the Clinic’s licence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 At the hearing before us, the Appellant focused his case on the prejudice relating to the conduct of his defence. He argued that his ability to defend himself was impaired as witnesses were no longer contactable and the quality of any evidence has diminished as a result of the delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 No charge has been framed yet in the disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant. However, the parties took the view that it is clear that the likely charge would concern the practice of non-evidence based medicine.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">1</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">       </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">This was an appeal against a High Court Judge (“the Judge”)’s decision to dismiss an application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings. The genesis of the application surrounded 13 extensions of time (“EOT”) sought and granted during the course of a preliminary inquiry conducted under the disciplinary framework of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2014 Rev Ed) (“MRA”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">     </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The appellant, Dr Lee Pheng Lip Ian, operated a private clinic by the name of Integrated Medical Clinic (“the Clinic”). The Clinic had offered some medical services allegedly in contravention of the relevant regulations. When the Clinic’s licence was due for renewal, the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) refused to renew the Clinic’s licence unless the relevant regulations were complied with. The MOH also referred the matter to the Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3     The SMC lodged a complaint against the appellant in relation to his alleged offering of non-mainstream medical services and the prescription of bio-identical hormone replacement therapy and a wide range of plant products (“the Complaint”). A Complaints Committee (“CC”) was subsequently appointed to carry out a preliminary inquiry, which took almost four years. At the end of the inquiry, the CC concluded that a formal inquiry before a Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) should be held. During the preliminary inquiry, the CC sought 13 EOTs which were granted by the chairman of the Complaints Panel (“Chairman of CP”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4       The appellant filed an application to seek leave to commence judicial review proceedings to quash: (a) all applications by the CC to the Chairman of CP for EOT; (b) all decisions of the Chairman of CP granting EOT; and (c) the CC’s decision for a formal inquiry to be held by a DT. The appellant also sought a prohibiting order to prohibit the SMC from referring the Complaint to the Chairman of CP.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5    The Judge declined to grant leave for judicial review. The Judge considered s 42(2) of the MRA to be a directory provision and that applications for and grants of EOT under s 42(2) cannot be challenged on the grounds of illegality and irrationality. Further, the Judge held that the appellant did not suffer substantial prejudice as the SMC and the CC were not responsible for MOH’s decision to refuse to renew the Clinic’s licence or the Minister of Health’s decision to allow the appellant’s appeal or any interval or delay in between.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6       In this appeal, the appellant submitted that the Judge should not have delved into the merits of the case and should have adopted a multi-faceted inquiry instead of a binary mandatory or directory classification. Further, Parliament’s intention was for judicial review to lie in circumstances where the CC’s proceedings had been unfair or unreasonable to the medical practitioner and that he suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the delay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">       </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Court of Appeal emphasised that the requirement to obtain leave for judicial review is to filter out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage to prevent waste of judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment: at </span><strong style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">[34]</strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8        An application for leave in judicial review proceedings may be disposed of on its merits even at the leave stage. Where all relevant parties and information were before the court and parties were prepared to make full arguments, the distinction between the leave and merit stages became artificial. In this case, the parties filed affidavits and the arguments took place over two and a half days. If the Judge had granted leave for judicial review, it was difficult to see what new materials or arguments could have been presented at the merits stage: at <strong>[28]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9       The mandatory-directory distinction was merely a manifestation of the broader question of whether non-compliance affected the validity of an act or decision. The ultimate question was what Parliament intended the consequences of non-compliance to be, and this was an exercise in statutory interpretation: at <strong>[35]</strong> and <strong>[38].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10     The three-month period stipulated in s 42(1), when read alongside s 42(2) of the MRA, was not to be understood as a strict imperative for which non-compliance would result in invalid proceedings. Instead, the timelines were directory, expressing Parliament’s general expectation that complaints would be processed expeditiously. Further, the complexity of a matter and serious difficulties were matters of degree and of judgment, dependent very much on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Consequently, applications for and the grant of EOT made after the expiry of the initial stipulated period or extended periods were permissible and did not invalidate the disciplinary proceedings. Non-compliance with s 42(2) did not furnish any ground for judicial review. On the facts here, there was no breach of s42(2). If the discretion was shown to have been exercised in bad faith or with malice, it may be invalidated but there was no bad faith proved on the facts of this case: at <strong>[42]</strong>, <strong>[45]</strong>, <strong>[47],</strong> <strong>[48], [52] and [67]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11    The Court of Appeal held that the financial prejudice faced by the appellant was partly due to his own doing. The appellant refused to temporarily cease the services which were the cause of MOH’s concern and could have adjusted his business to suit the requirements of the relevant regulations until such time when his challenged could be fully ventilated. The non-availability of the appellant’s patients as witnesses was not prejudicial to the conduct of his defence. The key witnesses were likely to be the appellant himself and his experts and the appellant’s clinical notes and his justifications would be sufficient in determining whether he was acting in his patients’ best interests: at<strong> [58], [59], [62], </strong>and<strong> [64].</strong></span></p>
