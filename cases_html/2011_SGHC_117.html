<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The three applications before me were for orders
                    that the plaintiff in the counterclaim, Alphomega Research Group Ltd
                    (“Alphomega”), furnish security for the costs of various
                    defendants in the counterclaim. The details of the three applications are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     Summons No 3314 of 2010 was taken out
                        by the 5th defendant in the counterclaim, Ms Yeoh Lay Cheng
                        (“Yeoh”), and the security requested was for the sum of
                        $80,000 up until parties exchange their Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief
                        (“AEICs”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     Summons No 3525 of 2010 was taken out by the 4th defendant
                        in the counterclaim, Mr Heng Jee Kian (“Heng”), and the
                        security requested was for the sum of $100,000 up until parties exchange
                        their AEICs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     Summons No 5783 of 2010 was taken out by the 1st and 2nd defendants in the
                        counterclaim, Nanyang Law LLC (“Nanyang Law”) and Mr Ng
                        Kim Tean (“Ng”) respectively, and the security requested was
                        for the sum of $80,000 up to the Summons for Directions stage of the
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applications were taken out pursuant to s
                    388(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).
                    Although the applications were brought separately and were in fact heard on two
                    separate occasions, the determinative issue in all three applications is the
                    same, namely, whether Alphomega will be able to pay the costs of the various
                    defendants in the counterclaim should they succeed at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The present action was commenced by Nanyang Law
                    against Alphomega for the recovery of legal costs amounting to a sum of
                    $332,229.40. This sum represented the outstanding amount in respect of registrar
                    certificates which had been issued pursuant to the taxation of various Bills of
                    Costs drawn up for work done during the period between April 2008 and February
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Alphomega failed to enter an appearance and
                    Nanyang Law obtained a judgment in default of appearance (“the default
                    judgment”). However, Alphomega subsequently succeeded in setting aside
                    the default judgment on the basis that it had, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, a right of set-off (see <em>Nanyang Law LLC
                        v Alphomega Research Group Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 914 at
                        [23] to [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Alphomega takes the position that the present
                    action is a sequel to the shareholders’ dispute which culminated in a
                    minority oppression action brought by a minority shareholder, Dr Tan Choon
                    Yong (“Dr Tan”). Dr Tan had been the CEO and director of
                    Alphomega until he was removed during a board meeting by the majority
                    shareholders. The majority shareholders were the 3rd defendant in the
                    counterclaim, Mr Goh Jon Keat (“Goh”), and Heng’s wife,
                    Ms Tan Hui Kiang (“Ms Tan”). In <em>Tan Choon Yong
                        v Goh Jon Keat and Ors</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 840
                        (“<em>Tan Choon Yong</em>”), Tan Lee
                    Meng J (“Tan J”) found in favour of
                Dr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Relying on Tan J’s decision and
                    findings in <em>Tan Choon Yong</em>, Alphomega
                    counterclaimed against Nanyang Law, Ng (as Nanyang Law’s Chairman), and
                    the previous board of directors which included Yeoh and Heng (as a
                    “shadow director”). The causes of action against them were for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, breaches of the duty to act in the
                    best interest of Alphomega, and conspiracy to misuse Alphomega’s resources
                    to oppress Dr Tan’s rights as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on security for costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Section 388(1) of the Act provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Security for costs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>388</b>. (1) Where a corporation
                        is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding the court having
                        jurisdiction in the matter may, <em>if it appears by
                            credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the
                            corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if
                            successful in his defence</em>, require sufficient security
                        to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security
                        is given. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       If the court is satisfied that there is credible
                    evidence that the plaintiff will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs
                    should the defendant succeed at trial, the court’s discretion to order
                    security for costs (“security”) is invoked. However, even if the
                    defendant discharges its burden of showing credible evidence of the
                    plaintiff’s inability to pay costs, this does not mean that security would
                    be ordered as of course. As held in <em>Creative Elegance (M) Sdn
                        Bhd v Puay Kim Seng</em> [1999] 1 SLR 60 (“<em>Creative Elegance</em>”) at [13], the court will have to consider all
                    relevant circumstances and decide whether it is just to order that the plaintiff
                    provide security. Several of the factors that the courts have found to be
                    relevant at this stage include whether the ordering of security is being used
                    oppressively to stifle a genuine claim (see <em>Creative
                        Elegance</em> at [32]), and whether the plaintiff’s want of
                    means was brought about by the conduct of the defendants (see <em>Frantonios Marine Services Pte Ltd v Kay Swee Tuan</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 237 (“<em>Frantonios</em>”) at [38]). As held in <em>Omar Ali
                        bin Mohd v Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdulkadir Alhadad</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 407 (“<em>Omar Ali</em>”)
                    at [21] and [37], the court should not
                    generally go into a detailed examination of the merits of the action because the
                    merits would not be relevant unless there appears to be a high degree of
                    probability in one direction or another.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the court ought to consider the applications
                separately</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before delving into the substance of this
                    application, it is necessary that I deal with one preliminary matter. Given that
                    multiple parties have applied for security, an issue arose as to whether the
                    applications should be considered together or separately. In other words, would
                    the discretion to order security be invoked as regards a particular application
                    for security if the plaintiff is able to pay the costs of that defendant, but
                    not the costs of the other defendants as well?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the present case, Nanyang Law and Ng had
                    applied for $80,000 in security, Yeoh had applied for $80,000 in security, and
                    Heng had applied for $100,000 in security. Therefore, it is crucial to determine
                    whether the discretion to order security would be invoked in respect of each
                    defendant on a showing that Alphomega would be unable to pay the costs of that
                    defendant ($80,000 in the case of Nanyang Law and Ng as well as Yeoh, and
                    $100,000 in the case of Heng) or of all the defendants ($260,000). This issue
                    could prove to be determinative should Alphomega be able to pay, for instance,
                    $100,000 in costs, but not more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Although there appears to be no local
                    authority directly addressing this issue, some guidance can be gleaned from the
                    decision of <em>Tjong Very Sumito &amp; Ors v Chan Sing En &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2010] SGHC 344 (“<em>Tjong
                        Very Sumito</em>”). In <em>Tjong Very
                        Sumito</em>, Andrew Ang J (“Ang J”) heard a
                    registrar’s appeal by the 1st defendant who had failed to obtain security
                    against the plaintiff together with applications by the 5th and 6th defendants
                    for security. The plaintiff’s solicitor argued that while his clients had
                    the ability to pay the costs of the 1st, 5th, and 6th defendants’, if all
                    the other eight defendants applied similarly for security, the plaintiff’s
                    claim may be stifled. In response to this argument, Ang J stated, at [46],
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    ... I take on board that likelihood. Should it
                            transpire that the other defendants similarly apply for security for
                            costs against the plaintiffs, <em>I direct that their
                                applications be fixed before me. Each application should be
                                considered separately, and the likelihood of stifling of the
                                plaintiffs’ claims should be assessed separately in each
                                application</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Ang J’s observations were made in the context
                    of a consideration of whether the application for security would stifle the
                    plaintiff’s claim (and this relates to the exercise of the discretion to
                    order security, and not whether the discretion is invoked in the first place),
                    it is clear that the approach taken was that of assessing the merits and
                    circumstances of each application for security independently of other similar
                    applications for security against the same plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In light of the court’s approach in
                        <em>Tjong Very Sumito</em>, I am of the view that each
                    application for security should be considered separately insofar as the question
                    is whether the discretion to order security is invoked. In reaching this
                    conclusion, I am fortified by three considerations. First, the plain words of s
                    388(1) of the Act state that the question is whether the plaintiff will be
                    unable to pay the “costs of the defendant if successful in his
                    defence”. The reference to “costs of the defendant”
                    suggests that the inquiry focuses on the costs of the particular defendant
                    applying for security, and not on the potential costs of other defendants.
                    Second, where a plaintiff claims against multiple defendants, it could well be
                    that some defendants might successfully defend against the claim while others
                    would be found liable. In such a case, to consider all the applications together
                    could result in the unfair result that security might be ordered even if the
                        <em>potential</em> for liability in costs against some
                    defendants is remote. Third, if the applications for security are brought one at
                    a time, the court hearing the first application would not ordinarily consider,
                    in deciding whether the discretion to order security is invoked, the possibility
                    that another defendant might take out an application for security. It would not
                    be logical, in principle, that the defendants could put themselves in a better
                    position to obtain security simply by bringing their applications at the same
                    time (although this could be desirable from a policy point of
                view).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It should be emphasised that although the
                    applications for security should be considered separately, this does <em>not</em> mean that the costs that may be payable to other
                    defendants is irrelevant. What this means is that the court must satisfy itself
                    that the plaintiff will be unable to pay the costs of <em>the
                        particular defendant applying for security</em> (<em>eg</em>, $80,000 in the case of Yeoh) and not the costs of all the
                    defendants. However, in assessing whether the plaintiff can pay costs of this
                    amount, the court can take into account <em>potential
                        liabilities</em>, and the costs that may be payable to other
                    defendants is one such potential liability. Nevertheless, the court must be
                    mindful not to ascribe too much weight to potential liabilities as such
                    liabilities have not been incurred and may not actually materialise in the
                    future. Furthermore, if potential liabilities are considered, the court should
                    likewise, in fairness, consider potential streams of income. Given that
                    potential liabilities and potential streams of income are both inherently
                    speculative, a broad approach should be taken, and such matters should only be
                    determinative in borderline cases.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In order to invoke the court’s
                    discretion to order security, the court has to determine whether there is
                    credible evidence that the plaintiff <em>will</em> be
                    unable to pay the defendant’s costs. In my view, the court should approach
                    this determination from two angles.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the court should consider the
                        plaintiff’s assets and liabilities to ascertain whether there would be
                        sufficient assets, after paying off liabilities, to satisfy a costs order in
                        favour of the defendant (see <em>Frantonios</em> at
                        [34]). As observed in <em>Ho Pak Kim Realty Co Pte Ltd v
                            Revitech Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 230 (“<em>Ho Pak Kim</em>”) at [8], the most obvious way for the court to gain insight into
                        such matters is through an examination of the plaintiff’s audited
                        accounts. Accordingly, as held in <em>Ho Pak Kim</em>
                        at [12], the failure to file audited
                        accounts for an extended period of time can be circumstantial evidence of a
                        plaintiff’s inability to pay costs although this failure would not
                        ordinarily, in itself, be sufficient to satisfy the condition in
                        s 388(1). Apart from audited accounts, bank statements are important as
                        they shed light on the plaintiff’s cash position. Similarly, documents
                        evidencing ownership of other assets that could be used to satisfy a cost
                        order in the defendant’s favour would be relevant. Liabilities would
                        include monies that the plaintiff will have to pay towards the fulfilment of
                        contracts, loan agreements, and judgments. Furthermore, as discussed above
                        at [13], potential streams of income
                        and potential liabilities can be taken into account, although care must be
                        taken not to place undue weight on such matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the court should consider
                        whether the plaintiff is a going concern, or a mere “shell”.
                        If the plaintiff is a mere “shell”, there would be a distinct
                        possibility that the plaintiff would be wound up should the defendant
                        succeed at trial since there would be little point for the plaintiff to pay
                        costs when it is not going to carry on business. In such a situation, the
                        defendant would be left with an unfulfilled costs order, which is precisely
                        what s 388(1) of the Act seeks to guard against. Conversely, a
                        plaintiff that is a going concern is less likely to institute a frivolous
                        claim as the potential for adverse costs order and possible damage to
                        reputation would have to be weighed against the chances of the claim
                        actually succeeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alphomega’s failure to file audited accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the present case, Alphomega has not laid
                    its audited accounts before an Annual General Meeting for almost two years, and
                    the last audited accounts were for the period ending 31 March 2008. As held
                    in <em>Ho Pak Kim</em> at [12], the failure to file audited accounts for an extended
                    period of time can be <em>circumstantial evidence</em> of a
                    plaintiff’s inability to pay costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, a plaintiff’s failure to file
                    audited accounts must be seen in light of <em>all the relevant
                        circumstances</em>. Alphomega appeared to have been an inactive
                    company after Tan J ruled in favour of Dr Tan in his minority
                    oppression action on 30 April 2009 (see <em>Tan Choon
                        Yong</em>). The new management, led by Dr Tan, only stepped back
                    into the picture in September 2009, and a new Board of Directors was appointed
                    in November 2009. Counsel for Alphomega submitted that the old management had
                    left the accounts in a state of mess, and that this accounted for the difficulty
                    in reconstructing the accounts. He submitted that the reconstruction of accounts
                    was further delayed because of the need to resuscitate Alphomega as well as the
                    efforts taken to defend against various claims by Nanyang Law and other
                    creditors. The new management had initially attempted to get the original
                    auditors to reconstruct the accounts, but subsequently new auditors had to be
                    appointed on 30 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Since the new Board of Directors was appointed
                    in November 2009, the new management has been in control of Alphomega for at
                    least 15 months. In my view, this should have been more than sufficient time to
                    reconstruct Alphomega’s accounts. Therefore, I took the failure to file
                    audited accounts to be circumstantial evidence that Alphomega would not be able
                    to pay costs. However, this circumstantial evidence did not point as strongly
                    towards an inability to pay as in the case of <em>Ho Pak
                        Kim</em>. First, assuming that a reasonable time to reconstruct
                    Alphomega’s accounts was six months, the delay in filing audited accounts
                    in the present case was less than a year compared to four years in <em>Ho Pak Kim</em>. In my view, it is also relevant that ACRA
                    had temporarily withheld prosecuting Alphomega after the company’s
                    solicitors made representations explaining the failure to file its Annual
                    Return. Second, a plausible explanation for the delay was proffered in the
                    present case whereas the plaintiff in <em>Ho Pak Kim</em>
                    had merely asserted that while it was admittedly poorly administered, this did
                    not mean it was impecunious. Third, Alphomega had produced other evidence of
                    assets (<em>eg</em>, a bank statement of the balance in its
                    bank account with UOB) whereas the plaintiff in <em>Ho Pak
                        Kim</em> relied solely on a bare assertion by one of its directors
                    that the company was capable of paying its costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of Alpomega’s assets and liabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Alphomega’s last audited accounts were
                    for the period between March 2007 and March 2008. These audited accounts did not
                    shed much light on the current financial position of Alphomega for two reasons.
                    First, these audited accounts must be read in light of the fact that Alphomega
                    was only incorporated in February 2007 and would thus have incurred start-up
                    costs without immediately being able to generate revenue. Second, more than
                    three years have passed since March 2008, and Alphomega’s financial
                    position would likely have changed substantially given the events leading up to
                    and culminating in the minority oppression action (see <em>Tan
                        Choon Yong</em>) as well as the subsequent change of management after
                    a period of inactivity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Without the benefit of audited accounts, I
                    turn to a consideration of the assets and liabilities identified by parties in
                    their submissions. The assets that Alphomega could point to in the present case
                    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sum of $1,152,370.06 in its bank
                        account with UOB (accurate as at 31 October 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The sum of $126,244.65 garnished from
                        its bank accounts with UBS AG and OCBC in respect of Nanyang Law’s
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sum
                        of $250,000 deposited in its client’s account with Drew &amp; Napier
                        LLC (“Drew &amp; Napier”) that is being held by Drew &amp;
                        Napier as stakeholder in respect of Nanyang Law’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The liabilities that Alphomega has incurred or will
                    incur after 31 October 2010 which the defendants to the counterclaimed
                    identified are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     The sum of $250,000 was paid to
                        Lim Hwee Hai on 18 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     On 8 November 2010, Alphomega entered into two
                        investment agreements with a Cambodian company to invest $200,000 and
                        $300,000 (“the investment agreements”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition, multiple lawsuits had been filed
                    against Alphomega, and judgments had been awarded against Alphomega:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sum of $47,708.20 was awarded
                        against Alphomega in respect of a suit filed by KPMG.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     The sum of $15,236.72 was awarded
                        against Alphomega in respect of a suit filed by Orix Capital Ltd
                        (“Orix”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sum of $19,995.00 was awarded against Alphomega in
                        respect of a suit filed by Hitachi Capital Singapore Pte Ltd
                        (“Hitachi”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Suit No 35 of 2009 was filed by Habib Ali for the sum of
                        $750,000. This action has been settled, but the terms of the settlement are
                        confidential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally, should Nanyang Law succeed in its
                    claim, Alphomega would have to pay Nanyang Law the sum of $265,231.40. If
                    Alphomega also fails in its counterclaim, it would then potentially be liable to
                    pay costs of up to $260,000 in respect of Nanyang Law, Ng, Yeoh and Heng as well
                    as further costs in respect of the 3rd and 6th defendants in the
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application for security taken out by Nanyang Law and Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I now turn to the application for security
                    taken out by Nanyang Law and Ng. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, Nanyang Law has garnished the sum of $126,244.65 from
                    Alphomega’s bank accounts with UBS AG and OCBC, and a further sum of
                    $250,000 is being held by Drew &amp; Napier as stakeholders with regard to
                    Nanyang Law’s claim. Therefore, Alphomega would have excess funds
                    amounting to $110,993.25 even if it pays the $265,231.40 allegedly owed to
                    Nanyang Law. These excess funds exceed the $80,000 which Nanyang Law and Ng are
                    requesting as security. Although the sums are held in respect of Nanyang
                    Law’s claim and not in respect of the counterclaim or Ng, the fact remains
                    that these monies would be available to satisfy a costs order should Nanyang Law
                    and Ng successfully defend against Alphomega’s counterclaim. Therefore, I
                    am of the view that this fact points strongly towards a finding that the
                    condition in s 388(1) is not fulfilled insofar as the application by
                    Nanyang Law and Ng is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Applications for security taken out by Heng and Yeoh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As discussed at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>, Nanyang Law’s claim and any potential costs orders
                    in relation to Nanyang Law and Ng can be fulfilled by the sum garnished and the
                    sum being held by Drew &amp; Napier as stakeholders. As such, these matters can
                    be disregarded for the purposes of the applications for security by Heng and
                    Yeoh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Taking into account the $250,000 paid to Lim
                    Hwee Hai and the $500,000 invested under the two investment agreements, the
                    balance remaining in Alphomega’s UOB bank account is likely to be
                    approximately $402,370.06. This sum would be far in excess of the security
                    requested by Heng ($100,000) and Yeoh ($80,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I am cognizant of the fact that $82,939.92
                    would have been due under the judgments obtained by KPMG, Orix and Hitachi.
                    Habib Ali’s claim for $750,000 has also been settled, and a settlement sum
                    would have to be paid, although the exact figure of this sum was not disclosed
                    due to the confidentiality of the settlement agreement. In my view, the sum of
                    $82,939.92 due under the judgments obtained by KPMG, Orix and Hitachi should not
                    be taken into account because the acting General Manager of Alphomega has stated
                    on affidavit that this sum has been settled, and the defendants in the
                    counterclaim have not adduced any evidence to the contrary. However, the fact
                    that a settlement sum would have to be paid to Habib Ali should be taken into
                    account although the weight given to this is reduced because the settlement sum
                    is unlikely to have been for the full $750,000 claimed and there is no evidence
                    that Alphomega has not been able to meet whatever payments are due to Habib Ali
                    (whether such payments are for a lump sum or by instalments).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As discussed at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, the potential costs payable to the other defendants in the
                    counterclaim (and this includes the 3rd and 6th defendants in the counterclaim,
                    but not Nanyang Law and Ng) are also relevant. However, if potential liabilities
                    are taken into account, so should potential streams of income. In this regard,
                    Alphomega’s investments in the Cambodian company are likely to generate
                    some revenue. In particular, Alphomega estimates that the revenue from the
                    project to build the Chea Sim Humanitarian Hospital is likely to be 2% of the
                    US$100 m budget (<em>ie</em>, US$2 m). The revenue from the
                    project to build the Brunei International Airport (“the Brunei
                    project”), if this materialises, would be approximately $900,000.
                    Furthermore, Alphomega has signed a letter of intent with a local company to
                    have an equity stake in the latter, and this letter of intent clearly indicates
                    Alphomega’s intention to be re-listed on OTC Capital. If Alphomega were to
                    re-list on OTC Capital, this would likely result in significant inflows of
                    capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I note that the figures regarding revenue are
                    merely estimates, and are no guarantee of the revenue that Alphomega will
                    actually earn. It is also unclear whether the Brunei project will actually
                    materialise (since the letter of intent had expired, and government approval is
                    still pending). Likewise, there is no guarantee that Alphomega will be able to
                    re-list on OTC Capital. However, in the totality of the circumstances, it did
                    appear that Alphomega was a going concern with a viable revenue stream. Taken
                    together with the fact that there is no evidence that Alphomega has not been
                    able to meet any of its debt obligations (<em>eg</em>, to
                    KPMG, Orix, Hitachi or Habib Ali), I am of the view that it is more likely than
                    not that future revenue would be able to sufficiently supplement the $402,370.06
                    in Alphomega’s UOB bank account such that Alphomega would be able to meet
                    any costs orders that may be made against it should Heng and Yeoh succeed at
                    trial. Therefore, I am of the view that the condition in s 388(1) for invoking
                    the court’s discretion to order security is not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Alphomega is a going concern</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As stated at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>, my decision is influenced, in part, by the fact that I
                    consider Alphomega to be a going concern. The defendants in the counterclaim
                    took a different position, and argued that Alphomega is not a going concern
                    because it has severely curtailed its business operations. In this regard, the
                    defendants in the counterclaim pointed to the fact that Alphomega had sold its
                    only substantial asset, a property at 6 Sungei Kadut Way (“the
                    property”), and had sold rigs belonging to its subsidiary, Thalpha.
                    However, Alphomega explained that the selling of the property and the rigs were
                    commercial decisions consistent with the company’s new strategy of
                    focusing on research and consultancy. In particular, the rigs had been sold
                    because the micro piling industry had been undergoing a downturn, and the cost
                    of replacing accessories that had gone missing outweighed the profits from
                    potential contracts in the near future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In support of its contention that Alphomega is
                    a going concern focused on research and consultancy, Alphomega pointed to the
                    investment agreements with the Cambodian company, the letter of intent (and a
                    subsequent email) in relation to the Brunei project, and the letter of intent it
                    had signed with a local company to have an equity stake in the latter. In my
                    view, the investment agreements and letters of intent point towards Alphomega
                    being a going concern. More importantly, if the new management did not intend to
                    run Alphomega as a viable business, there would be no reason for them to take
                    control of the company, settle debts, appoint new auditors, and enter into
                    investment agreements. Therefore, I consider Alphomega to be a going concern,
                    and this weighs against a finding that Alphomega will be unable to pay its
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view
                    that the defendants in the counterclaim have not adduced credible evidence that
                    Alphomega will be unable to pay their costs should they succeed at trial.
                    Therefore, the discretion to order security is not invoked. Since the discretion
                    to order security is not invoked, there is no need to consider whether the
                    discretion to order security should be exercised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the circumstances, the applications for
                    security by Nanyang Law, Ng, Yeoh and Heng are dismissed. I will hear parties on
                    costs at a later date.</p>
