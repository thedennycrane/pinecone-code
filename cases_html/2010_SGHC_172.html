<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Mdm Teh Siew Hua
                    (“the Petitioner”) under s 112(4) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) to vary an order made by the High Court
                    in a Decree Nisi granted on 30 January 1992, some 19 years
                ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the end of the hearing, I granted the
                    Petitioner’s application, but in view of the novel point this case raised
                    under the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”), I now give the reasons for my decision. I was informed by counsel
                    for the Petitioner, Ms Lim Hui Min, that the situation faced by the
                    Petitioner is not an uncommon one and therefore it would be useful for a
                    reasoned decision to be delivered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The marriage between the Petitioner and
                    Mr Tan Kim Chiong (“the Respondent”), solemnised on
                    4 January 1965, was dissolved by a Decree Nisi dated 30 January 1992
                    granted by K S Rajah JC. It was further ordered in para 1 of the
                    Decree Nisi that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Respondent do transfer his interest in the matrimonial property known
                        as “Blk 813 Tampines Street 81, #11-544, Singapore
                        1852” to the Petitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Decree Nisi was made absolute on 26 May
                    1992, but the Respondent took no steps to comply with the order and transfer his
                    interest in the matrimonial property (now known as “Blk 813 Tampines
                    Street 81, #11-544, Singapore 520813”) to the Petitioner. On her
                    part, the Petitioner took no steps to compel the Respondent to effect the
                    transfer until recently, in November 2009, when she requested that the
                    Respondent do so. As the Petitioner was getting on in years, she decided to take
                    steps to regularise the situation to ensure that her beneficiaries, <em>ie</em> her children, would not face difficulties from the
                    Respondent should she pass away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent, however, refused to comply, and
                    asked for the property to be sold and the proceeds to be divided equally. Such a
                    course of action being unacceptable to the Petitioner, she then applied, via the
                    Legal Aid Bureau, to vary the Decree Nisi by including the following two
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    That the Respondent is to sign all the necessary
                            documents to effect the transfer of the matrimonial flat referred to in
                            paragraph 1 of the Decree Nisi within 7 days of the service of this
                            order on the Respondent by ordinary post (“the stipulated
                            time”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    That should the Respondent fail to sign the
                            necessary documents to effect the said transfer within the stipulated
                            time, the Registrar of the Supreme Court is to be empowered to sign all
                            the necessary transfer documents on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent challenged the application on the
                    sole basis that he had no knowledge of the order because both the petition and
                    the consequent order were not served on him. This initially posed difficulties
                    to the Petitioner since the order was made some time ago and she was unable to
                    fully explain the circumstances under which the order came to be made.
                    Eventually, however, the Legal Aid Bureau managed to retrieve the court file and
                    an affidavit was filed to exhibit the earlier affidavit of service which was
                    filed for the Decree Nisi. It was clear from the affidavit of service that the
                    Respondent had knowledge of the petition. Given that it happened so long ago, it
                    was perhaps understandable that the Respondent was unable to recall the precise
                    circumstances under which the order was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Although this effectively disposed of the
                    objection raised by the Respondent, I expressed concern at the hearing that
                    there might be a question of a time bar. The Decree Nisi was granted in 1992,
                    but the Petitioner had failed to take any step to enforce the order therein for
                    19 years. In particular, I queried whether:</p>

                            of the Act;</div>

                            2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the application was time-barred under s 9(1)

                            laches or delay.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Counsel for the Petitioner, Ms Lim, was
                    able to expeditiously furnish me with a clear and comprehensive set of
                    submissions and authorities which addressed these questions, and I would like to
                    record my deep appreciation and gratitude to her and the Legal Aid Bureau for
                    their assistance in this matter, as well as for the commendable work that they
                    do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary Observations on s 112(4) of the Women’s
                Charter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The power of the court to vary an order as to
                    the division of matrimonial assets is to be found in s 112(4) of the
                    Women’s Charter, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may, <em>at any time it thinks fit</em>,
                        extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may
                        vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It has been suggested that an order for the
                    division of matrimonial assets is a “one-off order” and as such,
                    does not allow for variation: Leong Wai Kum, <em>Principles of
                        Family Law in Singapore</em> (Singapore: Butterworths Asia, 1997) at
                    p 910, approved in <em>Lee Kok Yong v Lee Guek Hua (alias Li
                        Yuehua)</em> [2007] SGHC 26 at [16]. Nonetheless, the court
                    can vary such an order if it is appropriate to do so, such as where the court
                    order is unworkable or did not provide for a particular situation or contingency
                    which has arisen subsequent to the order: <em>Nalini d/o
                        Ramachandran v Saseedaran Nair s/o Krishnan</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 98 at [13].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The express wording of s 112(4) of the
                    Women’s Charter (<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), in
                    particular the operative phrase “
                    <em>at any time it thinks fit</em>”, appears to
                    suggest that the power it confers on the court to vary or revoke any previous
                    order cannot be extinguished by the mere lapse of time. Whether this suggestion
                    is correct, however, would depend on further consideration of the provisions of
                    the Act since, as McGee, <em>Limitation Periods</em>
                    (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006)
                    (“McGee”) points out at para 1.046:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t follows from the absence of any common law concept of limitation that
                        in the event of a lacuna in the statutory provisions, no limitation period
                        will apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Application was Time-Barred under s 6(3) of the
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Section 6(3) of the Act provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An action upon any judgment shall not be brought after the expiration of
                        12 years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable and no
                        arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after
                        the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the interest became
                        due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     “Action” is defined in s 2
                    of the Act as including “a suit or any other proceedings in a
                    court”. It followed, therefore, that if the Petitioner’s
                    application was “an action upon any judgment”, it would have been
                    time-barred by the operation of s 6(3) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In my view, the Petitioner’s application
                    was not “an action upon any judgment”, and s 112(4) of the
                    Women’s Charter was therefore not subject to s 6(3) of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Act was based on the UK’s Limitation
                    Act 1939 (2 &amp; 3 Geo 6, c 21) (see [50] of the Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment in <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc (trading as
                        Caesars Palace)</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1129 (“<em>Caesars Palace (CA)</em>”), s 2(4) of which was
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with s 6(3) of the Act,
                    while s 31 read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Action” includes any proceedings in a court of law,
                        including an ecclesiastical court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Following the final report of the Law Reform Committee on <em>Limitations of Actions</em> (1977) (Cmnd 6923), the
                    Limitation Act 1939 was subsequently re-enacted as the Limitation Act 1980 (c
                    58), s 24(1) of which was identical to s 2(4) of the Limitation Act
                    1939 and s 6(3) of the Act, save that the limitation period was reduced
                    from 12 years to 6 years, while the definition of “action” in
                    s 38(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 remained the same as in s 31 of the
                    Limitation Act 1939.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Given the history of the Act, English
                    judgments on the scope of s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939 and
                    s 24(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 are highly persuasive authorities on the
                    interpretation of s 6(3) of the Act. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Caesars Palace (CA)</em> stated at [53]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, since [the Act] can be traced back to the 1939 UK Limitation
                        Act, Brandon J’s decision in <em>Berliner
                            Industriebank</em> is authoritative on the ambit of
                            ss 6(1)(<em>a</em>) and 6(3) of [the
                        Act]…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The reference is to <em>Berliner Industriebank
                        Aktiengesellschaft v Jost</em> [1971] 1 QB 278
                        (“<em>Berliner Industriebank</em>”),
                    which was itself founded on the reasoning employed in an earlier case, <em>W T Lamb &amp; Sons v Rider</em> [1948] 2 KB 331
                        (“<em>Lamb</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In <em>Lamb</em>, the
                    plaintiffs obtained judgment against the defendant for the price of goods sold
                    and delivered in December 1938, but no steps were taken to enforce the judgment
                    until March 1946. Since more than 6 years had passed, the plaintiffs needed
                    leave to proceed to execution under Ord 42, r 23(a) of the UK’s
                    Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883 (“RSC”) (similar to O 46,
                    r 2(1)(a) of the ROC (see below at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>)). Before the English Court of Appeal, the plaintiffs contended
                    that they did not require leave to issue execution, on the ground that
                    Ord 42, r 23 was <em>ultra vires</em> the
                    statutory right, contained in s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939, to issue
                    execution at any time up to 12 years. In particular, it was contended that
                    proceeding to execution counted as “any proceedings in a court of
                    law” in s 31 of the Limitation Act 1939 and was therefore “an
                    action upon any judgment” in s 2(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Rejecting this contention, Scott LJ held
                    at 338 that s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939 dealt only with the
                    substantive right to sue for and obtain a judgment, while RSC Ord 42 was
                    only concerned with the procedural machinery for enforcing a judgment that had
                    already been obtained. Scott LJ then concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The two subjects were formerly quite independent and distinct, the one
                        from the other, and we are quite unable to attribute to the definition of
                        "action" in the Limitation Act, 1939, the effect of merging the two
                        together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This reasoning was followed by Brandon J
                    in <em>Berliner Industriebank</em>, the facts of which are
                    immaterial for present purposes, where he concluded at 293 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the word “enforceable” in section 2(4) of the
                        Limitation Act, 1939… means “enforceable by action on the
                        judgment” and not “enforceable by execution on the
                        judgment.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is clear, therefore, that <em>Lamb</em> and <em>Berliner
                        Industriebank</em> viewed s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939 as
                    being concerned with the substantive right to bring a fresh action on a
                    judgment, and not the procedural right of execution of an existing judgment,
                    which was considered a separate right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This result was endorsed, albeit reluctantly,
                    by a unanimous House of Lords in <em>Lowsley v Forbes (trading as
                        L E Design Services)</em> [1999] 1 AC 329 (“<em>Lowsley v Forbes”</em>). In that case, the plaintiffs
                    obtained judgment against the defendant in February 1981, but the judgment
                    remained unenforced till the plaintiffs obtained leave to execute the judgment
                    under Ord 46, r 2(1)(a) of the UK’s Rules of the Supreme Court
                    1965 (SI 1965 No 1776) (the successor to RSC Ord 42, r 23(a) and
                    identical to O 46, r 2(1)(a) of the ROC (see below at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>)). One of the questions before the House of
                    Lords was whether s 24(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 barred the plaintiffs
                    from proceeding to execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Lord Lloyd of Berwick, delivering the judgment
                    of the House, disagreed with the reasoning of Scott LJ in <em>Lamb</em>, but held that it must have been taken by
                    Parliament to represent the existing law when Parliament accepted the
                    recommendations of the Law Reform Committee and enacted s 24(1) of the
                    Limitation Act 1980 with no changes other than the reduction of the limitation
                    period from 12 years to 6 years. Consequently, Lord Lloyd held at 342
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Action” in s 24(1) means a fresh action, and does not
                        include proceedings by way of execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The interpretation established by <em>Lamb</em> and <em>Lowsley v Forbes</em>
                    was confirmed again by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Ridgeway Motors (Isleworth) Ltd v ALTS Ltd</em> [2005]
                    1 WLR 2871 (“<em>Ridgeway
                    Motors</em>”), where a judgment for costs was obtained by the
                    appellant in 1998, but the judgment debt remained unpaid till 2004. When the
                    respondent, as judgment creditor, presented a winding up petition, the appellant
                    applied to strike out the petition, contending that it fell within the
                    definition of “action” in s 38(1) of the Limitation Act 1980,
                    and as such it was statute-barred under s 24(1) of the 1980
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mummery LJ stated at [29] that,
                    notwithstanding the extended definition of “action” in
                    s 38(1) of the Limitation Act 1980:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“An action upon a judgment” has been treated since <em>WT Lamb &amp; Sons v Rider</em> [1948] 2 KB 331
                        by the courts, by the Law Reform Committee and by Parliament itself as
                        having the special or technical meaning of a "fresh action" brought upon a
                        judgment in order to obtain a second judgment, which can be executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the same time, Mummery LJ did not regard a winding up petition
                    as a process of execution of the judgment on which the petition was based.
                    Instead, he considered that a winding up petition was <em>sui
                        generis</em>, but in any event not within s 24(1) of the 1980 Act
                    and therefore not statute-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mummery LJ did not consider this to be an
                    unsatisfactory result, as he accepted at [31] that there were good policy
                    reasons for distinguishing between action and execution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, in my opinion, much to be said for the submission
                        of Mr Anthony Mann QC, appearing as counsel for the plaintiff judgment
                        creditors in <em>Lowsley v Forbes</em> [1999]
                        1 AC 329, 333:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“… Limitation statutes are intended to prevent stale
                            claims, to relieve a potential defendant of the uncertainty of a
                            potential claim against [him] and to remove the injustice of increasing
                            difficulties of proof as time goes by. These considerations do not apply
                            to execution. If it is unfair to have a judgment debt outstanding with
                            interest running at a high rate, the debtor has the remedy of paying the
                            debt or taking out his own bankruptcy if he cannot pay
                            it.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I was of the opinion that the interpretation
                    adopted by the English courts in <em>Lamb</em>, <em>Berliner Industriebank</em>, <em>Lowsley v
                        Forbes</em> and <em>Ridgeway Motors</em> on
                    s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939 and s 24(1) of the Limitation Act
                    1980 was also the interpretation to be given to s 6(3) of the Act for two
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, the earliest version of the Act –
                    the Limitation Ordinance 1959 (Ord No 57 of 1959) – was enacted long
                    after <em>Lamb</em>, and it was to be presumed that
                    Parliament, in adopting the English regime set out in the Limitation Act 1939,
                    was aware of the interpretation given to s 2(4) of the latter Act by the
                    English courts. Further, the fact that the Act was re-enacted a number of times
                    thereafter, with no adverse comment by Parliament on the interpretations adopted
                    by the English courts, led to the inference that, as Lord Lloyd commented at 342
                    in <em>Lowsley v Forbes</em>, “Parliament [had]
                    given its blessing to <em>W T Lamb &amp; Sons v
                        Rider</em>…”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, the interpretation adopted by the
                    English courts has also been accepted by the local courts. In <em>Tan Kim Seng v Ibrahim Victor Adam</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 181, our Court of Appeal commented on s 6(3) of the Act
                    and stated at [29] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…one must bear in mind the distinction between
                        “execution” and “an action upon any judgment”.
                        In <em>Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 28</em> (4th Ed,
                        Reissue, 1997) at para 916, the learned authors stated the following in
                        a footnote, in commenting on the equivalent English provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A]n action upon a judgment applies only to the enforcement of
                            judgments by suing on them and does not apply to the issue of executions
                            upon judgments for which the leave of the court is required, after six
                            years have elapsed, by RSC Ord 46 r 2(1)(a); in matters of
                            limitation the right to sue on a judgment has always been regarded as
                            quite distinct from the right to issue execution under it, but the court
                            will not give leave to issue execution when the right of action is
                            barred: …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although no citation was provided, it was clear that the
                    passage quoted from <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> was derived from <em>Lamb</em> and
                        <em>Berliner Industriebank</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Similar endorsements of the English judgments
                    can be found in [53] of <em>Caesars Palace (CA)</em> (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>), as well as [63] to [68] of
                        <em>Desert Palace Inc (trading as Caesars Palace) v Poh Soon
                        Kiat</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 71 (“<em>Caesars Palace (HC)</em>”) (which was not overruled by the
                    Court of Appeal on this point).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the basis of these authorities, I therefore
                    decided that the Petitioner’s application was not “an action upon
                    any judgment” within s 6(3) of the Act as it was not a “fresh
                    action” brought on a judgment in order to obtain a second judgment, and
                    consequently was not barred after the lapse of 12 (or more) years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This conclusion raised the question as to
                    when, if ever, s 6(3) of the Act would bite, given that a judgment creditor
                    who brought a fresh action on a judgment (which was not executed) would simply
                    end up with a new judgment which he would then have to take further steps to
                    execute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To understand the ambit of s 6(3) of the
                    Act, it is necessary to appreciate some of the legal history behind the
                    enforcement of judgments. There are two ways of enforcing judgments: by action
                    and by execution (see <em>Caesars Palace (HC)</em> at
                    [63]). As McGee states at para 17.003 (see also <em>Lamb</em> at 336):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The practice of bringing an action on a judgment was common in the days
                        when the common law presumption was that a judgment was satisfied after a
                        year and a day if no execution had been issued. In such cases the only way
                        to “enforce” the judgment was by an action of debt upon it.
                        Even today bringing a second action in this way is a matter of right,
                        although the court may decline to give judgment in the second action if it
                        regards it as an abuse of process. In determining whether it is an abuse of
                        process, the availability of execution is a relevant factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, there is authority to the effect that an action on a judgment
                    will be dismissed as an abuse of the process of the court if the ordinary
                    process of execution was available: <em>Pritchett v English and
                        Colonial Syndicate</em> [1899] 2 QB 428, 435 (per Lindley
                    MR); <em>E D &amp; F Man (Sugar) Ltd v Haryanto</em> [1996]
                    Times LR 491 (“<em>Haryanto</em>”), 492
                    (per Leggatt LJ).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     While it is true that, in practice, actions on
                    judgments are now very rare for this reason (see Oughton, Lowry and Merkin,
                        <em>Limitation of Actions</em> (LLP: London, 1998)
                        (“<em>Limitation of Actions</em>”),
                    p 137-138), they are nonetheless still maintainable in exceptional
                    circumstances, and it is in those cases that s 6(3) of the Act remains
                    relevant. Indeed, at para 4.15 of the Law Reform Committee’s final
                    report on <em>Limitations of Actions</em> (<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), after recommending the reduction of
                    the limitation period in s 2(4) of the Limitation Act 1939 (the equivalent
                    of s 6(3) of the Act) from 12 years to 6 years, the Law Reform Committee
                    commented:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If these recommendations are accepted, there will in future rarely be any
                        advantage in attempting to enforce a judgment by means of a fresh action,
                        since the period for execution itself will be at least as long as that for
                        the further action. <em>It would, however, possibly be to a
                            judgment creditor’s advantage to sue on the judgment so as to give
                            himself a fresh limitation period (running from the judgment in the new
                            action), since he would not then be dependent on the exercise of the
                            court’s discretion to extend the time for enforcing the earlier
                            judgment by execution. But such a situation would not often
                            occur…</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     A fresh action on a judgment was held not to
                    be an abuse of process and therefore allowed in the following cases: in
                        <em>Haryanto</em>, where execution was unavailable as
                    the defendant went to great lengths to evade payments due from him under various
                    judgments and arbitration awards; in <em>Bennett v The Governor
                        and Company of the Bank of Scotland</em>
                    [2004] EWCA Civ 988, where the defendant bank commenced the new
                    action in order to preserve its rights to take bankruptcy proceedings against
                    the plaintiff pending the uncertain outcome of an appeal to the House of Lords;
                    and in <em>Kuwait Oil Tanker Company SAK v Al Bader</em>
                    [2008] EWHC 2432 (Comm), where the plaintiffs instituted the fresh
                    action, a few days before the expiry of the 6 year limitation period under
                    s 24(1) of the Limitation Act 1980, out of an abundance of caution, as it
                    was feared that efforts to recover the judgment debt from the defendant in
                    Switzerland might be prejudiced should the first judgment cease to be
                    enforceable in England on the expiry of the limitation period.</p>

                    speaking not a form of execution (assuming the petitioner is a judgment
                    creditor) as it may lead to the company being wound up with no recovery accruing
                    to the petitioner. It cannot, in such a case, be said that the petitioner is
                    enforcing the judgment he had obtained, if he does not receive the very
                    satisfaction or relief which the judgment would have otherwise entitled him to.
                    Creditors sometimes adopt this route in order to claim tax reliefs for bad debts
                    rather than for the purposes of enforcing a judgment debt. Viewed in this way, a
                    winding up petition may indeed be characterised as <em>sui
                        generis</em>, as it was in <em>Ridgeway
                        Motors</em>. However, I was not convinced that this was the right way
                    of viewing the matter in the present case, for it seemed to me that the
                    application was indeed a process of executing the Decree Nisi, albeit one that
                    would not require a writ of execution or possession. Although couched as an
                    application to vary, it was effectively an application to enforce the earlier
                    order (since the Petitioner was seeking the very relief the Decree Nisi entitled
                    her to). However, it was not necessary for me to decide the exact juridical
                    nature of the Petitioner’s application in order to grant it. Suffice it to
                    say that it is not governed by O 46, r 2(1)(a) of the
                ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Application was Time-Barred under s 9(1) of the
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The third question was whether the
                    Petitioner’s application was barred under s 9(1) of the Act, which
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the
                        expiration of 12 years from the date on which the right of action accrued to
                        him, or, if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims, to that
                        person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Notwithstanding that the Petitioner was
                    seeking to compel the Respondent to transfer his interest in the matrimonial
                    property to her, I decided that the application did not fall foul of s 9(1)
                    of the Act, for the simple reason that, as ss 10(1) and 15 of the Act
                    indicate, s 9 of the Act is concerned with an action by a person with legal
                    title to the land against an adverse possessor:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Accrual of right of action in case of present interests
                            in land</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>10</b>. – (1) Where the person bringing an
                        action to recover land or some person through whom he claims has been in
                        possession thereof and has, whilst entitled thereto, <em>been
                            dispossessed or discontinued his possession</em>, <em>the right of action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date
                            of the dispossession or discontinuance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Right of action not to accrue or continue unless there
                            is adverse possession</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15</b>. – (1)  <em>No right of action to recover land shall be deemed to accrue
                            unless the land is in the possession of some person</em> in whose
                        favour the period of limitation can run (referred to in this section as
                            <em>adverse possession</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  Where under this Act any such right of action is deemed to
                        accrue on a certain date and no person is in adverse possession on that
                        date, the right of action shall not be deemed to accrue unless adverse
                        possession is taken of the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  Where a right of action to recover land has accrued and
                        thereafter, before the right is barred, the land ceases to be in adverse
                        possession, the right of action shall no longer be deemed to have accrued
                        and <em>no fresh right of action shall be deemed to accrue
                            unless the land is again taken into adverse
                        possession</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This is also the position in the UK with
                    regard to the equivalent provisions of the Limitation Act 1980: <em>Buckinghamshire County Council v Moran</em> [1990]
                    1 Ch 623, 644 (per Nourse LJ).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There was no question of adverse possession in
                    this case, as the Petitioner had continually been in possession of the
                    matrimonial property even prior to the date of the Decree Nisi. Consequently,
                    the operation of s 9(1) of the Act was not triggered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Application was Defeated by Acquiescence, Laches or
                Delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Section 32 of the Act provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Acquiescence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>32</b>. Nothing in this Act shall affect any
                        equitable jurisdiction to refuse relief on the ground of acquiescence,
                        laches or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Notwithstanding this provision, however, I
                    decided that the Petitioner’s application was not barred on the grounds of
                    acquiescence or laches for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     First, these defences only operate against
                    claims for equitable relief (see <em>Limitation of
                        Actions</em>, p 22). As the Petitioner was seeking a statutory
                    remedy under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter, the equitable defences
                    of acquiescence and laches were inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Second, s 112(4) of the Women’s
                    Charter expressly contemplates that the power it confers may be exercised by the
                    court “at any time it thinks fit” (see above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Third, the operation of the defences of
                    acquiescence and laches is generally contingent on the defendant being unjustly
                    prejudiced by the plaintiff’s dilatoriness. As Sir Barnes Peacock stated
                    in <em>The Lindsay Petroleum Company v Prosper Armstrong Hurd,
                        Abram Farewell, and John Kemp</em> (1874) LR 5 PC 221,
                    239-240:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where it would be practically <em>unjust</em> to give
                        a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which
                        might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his
                        conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put
                        the other party in <em>a situation in which it would not be
                            reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be
                            asserted</em>, in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay
                        are most material. But in every case, if an argument against relief, which
                        otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course
                        not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that
                        defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two
                        circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the length of the delay
                        and <em>the nature of the acts done during the
                            interval</em>, which might affect either party and cause a balance
                        of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as
                        relates to the remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this case, no prejudice would have been caused to the Respondent by
                    granting the application, given that he had had 19 years to comply with the
                    order in the Decree Nisi, and that there was no evidence that, during that time,
                    he had relied to his detriment on the Petitioner’s failure to enforce the
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other Considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As limitation is a defence that must be
                    pleaded by the defendant (see s 4 of the Act and O 18,
                    r 8(1)(a)), and since the Respondent had not specifically pleaded the
                    defence of limitation, I also determined that the Petitioner’s application
                    was not barred by the Act on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In addition, I was of the view that it was
                    appropriate for me to vary the original Decree Nisi, under s 112(4) of the
                    Women’s Charter, so as to include the two orders prayed for by the
                    Petitioner, as the original order was “unworkable or did not provide for
                    a particular situation or contingency which [had] arisen” (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), <em>viz</em>
                    that the Respondent had refused to comply with the original order in the Decree
                    Nisi for 19 years. I took into account the lack of prejudice to the Respondent
                    (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above), and I noted that the
                    absence of detriment was a material consideration in Tay Yong
                    Kwang J’s decision to vary a consent order under s 112(4) of the
                    Women’s Charter in [17] of <em>Nalini d/o Ramachandran v
                        Saseedaran Nair s/o Krishnan</em> (<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I therefore granted the Petitioner’s
                    application and ordered that the Decree Nisi be varied so as to include the two
                    orders in <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above. In view of the fact that
                    these divorce proceedings had dragged on long enough, and in the interests of
                    helping the parties draw a line under this litigation, I made no order as to
                    costs.</p>
