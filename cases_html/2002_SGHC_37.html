</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 This is an appeal against the decision of the District Judge

in DC Suit No. 3558/1999 in which he: (a) dismissed the Appellants’ application for a

permanent injunction against the Respondent carrying out certain purported acts of

nuisance; and (b) ordered the second to fifth Appellants to pay the cost of the hearing.

On 31 December 2001, after hearing the submissions of counsel for the Appellants and

Respondent, I dismissed the appeal. The Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court

of Appeal on 23 January 2002 and I now give my written grounds of decision.

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Trial</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The Appellants are the Plaintiffs in the DC Suit. The first Plaintiff

("CAA") is a company carrying on the business of repairing and servicing

aviation components at Buildings 110/143 East Camp, Seletar Airfield ("Building

110"). The second to fifth Plaintiffs are employees of CAA. The second Plaintiff

("Chui") is the managing director of CAA. The Defendant ("Fokker") is

a company carrying on the business of maintenance and repairing of aircraft at Building

139 Picadilly, East Camp, Seletar Airfield ("Building 139").</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The Plaintiffs claimed that on two occasions, i.e. (i) around 4 and 5

July 1998; and (ii) around 11 to 13 June 1999, Fokker had carried out painting works on

aircraft in Building 139 in such a manner that paint dust escaped from it and settled in

the premises of CAA and on motor vehicles belonging to CAA and the second to fifth

Plaintiffs, thereby committing acts of private nuisance. The Plaintiffs also claimed that

on various dates between June 1998 and July 1999 Fokker had committed similar acts of

nuisance in permitting paint dust to escape while they were conducting painting of

aircraft and that these were continuing acts. They claimed damages against Fokker and an

injunction to restrain Fokker from committing further acts of nuisance.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The claim in damages was settled between Fokker and the first, third,

fourth and fifth Plaintiffs on 15 December 2000 by way of a consent judgment entered

against Fokker in the sum of $29,545.89 plus interest and costs. The second

Plaintiff’s claim in damages was settled by way of a consent judgment entered on 8

May 2001 in the sum of $16,000. The sole issue that went to trial in the court below was

in respect of the Plaintiffs’ prayer for a permanent injunction.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 CAA had conducted its business of servicing and repairing aviation

components at Building 110 since 1985. Fokker had conducted its business of aircraft

maintenance and repair at Building 139 since 1997. Building 139 is an aircraft hangar

formerly used by the Royal Air Force when they were at the old Seletar Airbase. It is

about 50 metres from CAA’s premises. Another company, Hawker Pacific Asia Pte Ltd

("Hawker") operated its aircraft maintenance business at an adjacent hangar,

Building 138. All these buildings are leased from the Civil Aviation Authority of

Singapore ("CAAS"). In respect of CAA, the lease covered the buildings in

question as well as a small strip of land adjoining it, bound by a fence – I shall

refer to the land leased by CAA as the "Premises".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 Chui gave evidence that he received a fax from Fokker on 3 July 1998

advising that the latter would be carrying out spray painting in Building 139 on 4 and 5

July. He said that on those days, he recalled smelling paint and thinner when he was in

his office. He went over to Building 139 and saw that the hangar doors were open and the

smell came from it. Soon thereafter he discovered that paint particles had settled on five

vehicles, two belonging to CAA and the other three to the third, fourth and fifth

Plaintiffs. These vehicles were not parked at the Premises, but on a hard standing just

outside the gate which is state land managed by CAAS – I shall refer to this as the

"Carpark". Chui complained about this to Fokker’s manager, one Sathi

Suppiah ("Sathi"). They had some discussion regarding settling the matter by

Fokker undertaking the repairs of the vehicles. However this could not be resolved and in

August 1998 Chui complained to CAAS about the matter. Although proposals were made for a

meeting to discuss the issue, it was not held until after the second incident in June

1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 On 9 June 1999, Chui took delivery of his new car. He drove it to

work and left it at the Carpark on 11, 12 and 13 June. During those three days Fokker

conducted spray painting at Building 139. Chui said that the door of the hangar was left

open during the painting and paint particles settled on his new car. Arising from this a

meeting was held between representatives of CAA, Fokker and CAAS on 14 June 1999. CAAS

supplied a test panel to be used to detect paint particles. This was a sheet of metal

formed into a triangular tube, like advertisement panels found on the side of soccer

pitches. It was painted black to detect the white paint usually used by Fokker. On 16 June

1999, this panel was placed 3 metres from the gate of the Premises, this being about 46

metres from Fokker’s hangar. However there was conflicting evidence as to the result

of this exercise. Chui deposed that when he checked the panel a week later he saw white

paint particles deposited all over the test panel. However the representative from CAAS

testified that it was only on 27 June that he saw paint spots on the panel. It was only 4

to 5 spots and he could not conclude that they came from Fokker’s painting

operations.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 The District Judge considered that the issues before him were as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) whether the consent judgments obtained by the Plaintiffs in respect

  of their claims for damages could be admitted as evidence in the claim for an injunction;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) whether the second to fifth Plaintiffs have a cause of action in

  private nuisance as they had no proprietary interest in the Premises or the Carpark;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) whether CAA had acquired an interest in the Carpark, by way of an

  easement or quasi-easement;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) whether Fokker had interfered with the easement or quasi-easement

  or disturbed the enjoyment thereof by CAA; and</p>
<p align="justify">(5) whether Fokker have continued or threatened to continue the

  nuisance in the form of discharge of paint dust from Building 139.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 In respect of issue (1), the judge held that the consent judgments

were entered into without reservation and accordingly such evidence was admissible.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 As regards issue (2), the judge found that the second to fifth

Plaintiffs did not have any proprietary interest in the Carpark. The Plaintiffs’

counsel did not dispute this, but submitted that they had a cause of action in public

nuisance. However the judge held that this was not pleaded in the Statement of Claim,

which he had permitted to be amended by the Plaintiffs even up to the stage of the closing

submissions. This part of his decision is not appealed against.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 On issue (3), the judge held that CAA had an easement over the

Carpark. It is not clear in his judgment how he came to this decision but I assumed he

meant to hold that the right to park cars at the Carpark, which was the servient tenement,

was an easement appurtenant to the Premises which was the dominant tenement. I shall deal

with this in greater detail below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 In respect of issue (4), the judge found that Fokker had carried out

the spray painting on the two occasions in July 1998 and June 1999 in a manner that

permitted paint particles to escape and settle on the Plaintiffs’ vehicles. He

therefore found that Fokker had interfered with the easement, enjoyed by CAA as dominant

owner, over the Carpark.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 As for issue (5), the judge found that the Plaintiffs had not proved

on a balance of probability that the doors of the Fokker hangar were opened or partially

opened during the painting operations after June 1999 or that there was any escape of

paint from the holes or gaps in the hangar. He was satisfied that the systems put in place

by Fokker had made it unlikely that the environmental standards of emission were exceeded.

Further, the judge was satisfied that there was no evidence that Fokker had been

continuing the nuisance by permitting paint particles to escape from its hangar while

carrying out spray painting. In arriving at this decision the judge had analysed the

evidence of the witnesses. He also took into account the fact that there was no evidence

that the other neighbours, e.g. Hawker which was located nearer to Fokker than CAA was,

had complained about Fokker’s painting operations. He also considered that the grant

of a permanent injunction would be oppressive on Fokker who had taken adequate steps to

address the Plaintiffs’ complaints and was carrying out a legitimate business in an

industrial area.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 In the premises the judge dismissed the Plaintiffs’ application

for a permanent injunction with costs.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Appeal</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 On 27 June 2001, the Appellants filed the following notice of appeal

against the decision of the District Judge:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The decision not to allow the 1st Plaintiff leave to amend the

  Re-re-Amended Statement of Claim by adding a new paragraph 25 to state as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The 1st Plaintiff avers that it has an equitable easement over

    the parking area adjacent to its premises to park its cars and the cars belonging to its

    directors, employees and visitors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. The decision not to grant the 1st Plaintiff an injunction against

  the Defendants from spray painting aircraft in their hangar which is causing a nuisance.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The decision not to grant nor order as to costs payable by the 2nd

  to 5th Plaintiffs on the claim for an injunction.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Costs of this appeal and below.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Further and/or other relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 After hearing submissions from counsel, I dismissed the appeal in

respect of all three substantial prayers. I made no order as to costs in respect of the

appeal by the second to fifth Plaintiffs. In respect of the remainder of the appeal, I

ordered CAA to pay costs to Fokker. In their notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, the

Appellants had appealed against such of my decision as had decided the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The 1st Appellant does not have an easement to park cars in the

  parking area adjacent to the 1st Appellant's premises.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The 1st Appellant has not proven that there is a continuing nuisance

  by the Respondent.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Not to allow the further evidence adduced by the 1st Appellant

  establishing an easement and that the nuisance is continuing.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Not allowing the appeal filed by the 1st Appellant against the

  decision of the District Judge in dismissing the claim with costs.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Not allowing the appeal filed by the 2nd to 5th Appellants against

  the decision of the District Judge is [<i>sic</i>] ordering the 2nd to 5th Appellants to

  pay costs of the hearing.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Not reducing the costs ordered against the Appellants by the trial

  Judge as he found that there was nuisance and damage but which had subsequently been

  rectified after the commencement of the suit.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Not allowing the appeal and dismissing the appeal with costs to be

  agreed or taxed.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Costs of this appeal and below.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Further and/or other relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 Essentially there are only 4 issues in this appeal and I shall deal

with them in the following order:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(a) the refusal to allow fresh evidence to be adduced by CAA;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) the holding that there is no evidence of continuing nuisance;</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(c) the holding that CAA did not have an easement; and</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(d) the question of costs.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(a) Fresh Evidence</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 CAA applied for leave to adduce fresh evidence in the form of a

report by one Elizabeth Lee and Ding Jian who are respectively the Division Director and

Executive Chemist of Setsco Services Pte Ltd. It details a study carried out by Lee and

Ding. Between 19 July and 19 October 2001 they had placed two stainless steel boxes just

inside and just outside the Premises to collect paint particles. On 19 October 2001 they

retrieved the paint particles found inside the collection boxes. That same day they also

retrieved some paint particles from a liquid nitrogen tank located in the workshop.

Additionally, on 5 November 2001 they removed some paint particles from a forklift the

location of which was unspecified – presumably it was also in the Premises. They

carried out a spectral analysis of the paint retrieved from these three places and

concluded that the paint was the same as that used by Fokker.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 In 57 of the Appellants’ Skeletal Submissions, it is stated

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">57. This new evidence is crucial for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) It shows contamination of paint particles from 19 July … to 19

    October 2001;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) There can be no argument that the samples have been exposed to

    other industries or have travelled around;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The boxes confirm that the contamination is affectig the 1st

    Appellant’s property (as the 4 rectangular test panels had already shown) and not

    just cars parked in the parking area over which the 1st Appellant has an easement to park

    cars.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 Fokker objected to this application. If the new evidence were

admitted at this stage Fokker would have to be given the opportunity to cross-examine the

witnesses. This would entail remitting the matter to the District Court for further

evidence to be taken and delay disposal of this matter. There is nothing to stop CAA from

taking out another suit based on those alleged acts of private nuisance. In view of these

factors, I dismissed CAA’s application for leave to adduce fresh evidence.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(b) Continuing Nuisance</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 The District Judge had found as a question of fact that Fokker had,

since June 1999, cleaned up their act, so to speak. He found that the Plaintiffs had not

proved on a balance of probability that the doors of the Fokker hangar were open or

partially open during painting works after June 1999 or that there was any escape of paint

from the holes or gaps in the hangar.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 The evidence that CAA adduced to show that the nuisance had

continued after June 1999 was a joint report by Dr Balasubramaniam, Miss Elizabeth Lee and

Miss Ding Jian dated 20 January 2001. Dr Balasubramaniam is a Senior Lecturer at the

Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the National University of

Singapore. He is an "Air Quality Specialist" by training. He holds a Ph.D from

the University of Miami and has professional experience in assessing air quality,

environmental impact assessment, industrial emissions control and the design of

instruments to minimise and eliminate air pollution. Miss Lee is the Divisional Manager of

Setsco Services Pte Ltd ("Setsco"), the company engaged to produce the report.

She is trained as an environmental engineer. Miss Ding is the Chemist of Setsco. Dr

Balasubramaniam’s role in the report was to determine if Fokker’s air pollution

control practices are adequate and to assess "the likelihood of air pollution caused

by … paint particles from … the hangar to the outdoor environment". On 23

October 2000 he and Miss Lee inspected Fokker’s hangar in the presence of

Fokker’s representatives. His report was based on the information he obtained from

that inspection. He summarised his report in paragraph 6 of his affidavit

evidence-in-chief in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">6. I would just summarize my findings here and say that the Defendants

  do not have appropriate air pollution control devices such as extractor fans, external air

  exhaust system and a properly contained spray painting booth. The visual inspection alone

  revealed that the current air pollution control measures undertaken by Fokker are

  inadequate to prevent exfiltration of paint particles from the interior of the hangar to

  the outdoor environment during the process of spray painting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 While Dr Balasubramaniam was of the opinion that Fokker’s

system was inadequate to prevent what he termed "exfiltration" of paint

particles, he does not state whether this was so inadequate as to allow the paint to reach

the Premises or the Plaintiffs’ vehicles in the Carpark. This is addressed in the

other part of the report. CAA had supplied certain paint specimens to Setsco. In addition,

Setsco had obtained form Fokker specimens of paint used by the latter. Miss Ding carried

out spectral analyses of these paint and concluded that the specimens supplied by Setsco

matched those obtained from Fokker. However there is no mention in the report as to the

date the CAA paint specimens were collected and the judge found that such evidence <i>"did

not mean that paint dust had spread to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs’ premises and

settled on their buildings and cars from June 1999."</i> Fokker’s expert gave

evidence of the adequacy of the new system put in place after June 1999 and the judge was

satisfied that this new system had made it unlikely that the environmental standards of

emission were exceeded. He also took into account the fact that there was no evidence that

the other neighbours, e.g. Hawker which was located nearer to Fokker than CAA, had

complained about Fokker’s painting operations, and there was no action taken by the

Ministry of the Environment against Fokker. On the basis of the evidence before him,

including an evaluation of the veracity of the witnesses for both sides, the judge was

satisfied that there was no evidence that Fokker had been continuing the nuisance by

permitting paint particles to escape from its hangar while carrying out spray painting. I

could not see any basis to overrule the judge’s finding on fact on this matter.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(c) Easement</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 The District Judge had held that CAA had an easement to park

vehicles at the Carpark. He dealt with this issue at 31-36 of his judgment. He first

considered Fokker’s preliminary objection that the Plaintiffs had not pleaded any

facts pertaining to the acquisition of an easement. He held that those facts were not

pleaded but as the parties <i>"had fully canveassed and submitted on the facts and

the law regarding easement"</i>, he exercised his discretion and dismissed the

preliminary objection. Having done this, he proceeded to deal with the question of whether

there was an easement in 36 which goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">36. I agreed with Plaintiffs’ Counsel on the authorities he cited,

  that the 1st Plaintiffs had an easement over the area outside its premises where its cars

  were parked. In particular, I accepted the following statement in Principles of Singapore

  Land Law by Tan Sook Yee at page 405:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The right to park a car would probably be recognised as an

    easement, provided the parking lot is not the entire servient tenement. Judge Baker in <i>London

    &amp; Bleinheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd</i> held that the right to park

    cars can be an easement so long as the owner of the servient tenement is not denied the

    right to the reasonable use of this land".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">There was no evidence that CAAS were prevented from parking their cars

  in the area or from doing anything else there as in the case of <i>Copeland v Greenhall</i>

  [1952] Ch 448 (see page 239 NE and Defence Counsel’s submissions on Law of Nuisance

  and Easements). Defendants’ Counsel further relied on the law of Real Property where

  Sir Robert Megarry cited the unreported case of <i>Newman v Jones</i> which decided, on 22

  March 1982, that the right to park cars anywhere in a defined area, such as around a block

  of flats, constituted an easement. The cases of <i>Handel v St Stephen Close Ltd</i>
<nobr>[1994] 1 EGLR 70</nobr>, read in conjunction with section 62(2) of the UK Law of Property Act

  (similar to section 60 of our Conveyancing and Law of Property Act) also supported the

  Defendants’ case that the right to park cars regularly around or within the curtilage

  of a block or building could "give the lessee an easement of car parking appurtenant

  to his household" (at page 7 1-M). I therefore decided the third issue in favour of

  the Plaintiffs. The 1st Plaintiffs therefore have the right or locus standi to sue the

  Defendants in private nuisance because of their easement over the car park abutting their

  premises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 In arriving at his decision, the judge appeared to have focussed on

whether the right to park vehicles could form an easement rather than on whether such an

easement was in fact acquired. Counsel for Fokker had submitted that the judge was wrong

and that CAA did not have any easement to park vehicles on the Carpark. There was at most

only a licence. I was impressed with this argument and the reasons are as follows.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 An easement is created by grant, reservation or prescription: see

generally <i>Tan Sook Yee: Principles of Singapore Land Law</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed. 2001)

at p.535. If the easement is created by express grant, by operation of s 53 of the

Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, it must be by way of a deed in the English language.

There was no evidence of this in relation to the Carpark. There was also no evidence of an

implied grant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 As for creation by reservation there was no evidence of express

reservation. Indeed CAA had not adduced evidence of its lease agreement. There is the

possibility of an implied grant under the rule in <i>Wheeldon v Burrows</i> (1879) 12 Ch D

31. In <i>Principles of Singapore Land Law</i>, this rule is expressed as follows (at

p.538):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Where the common occupier of two parcels of land exercises a

  right, which is inherently capable of being an easement, over the alleged quasi servient

  tenement, then when he subsequently conveys the allged quasi dominant tenement to another

  while retaining the alleged quasi servient tenement for himself, an easement could arise

  by implied grant …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Under this rule, CAA would have to prove that CAAS, or its predecessors

in title, had once been the occupier of the Premises and the Carpark and had, in

connection with its use of the Premises, parked vehicles at the Carpark. There was not a

shred of evidence in this respect. Counsel for the Plaintiffs submitted that I should make

this inference but he was unable to provide me with any cogent grounds to do so. Neither

could I see any.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 I turn to the question of an easement being created by prescription.

The only possibility is by way of lost modern grant. The right to park vehicles must have

been exercised for at least 20 years before the Premises had been brought under the Land

Titles Act – see <i>Xpress Print Pte Ltd v Monocrafts Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[2000] 3 SLR 545</nobr> at

35-36. As CAA had only leased the Premises since 1985, apart from any other

consideration, there is no possibility of an easement being created by prescription. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 In view of these considerations, I would have held that CAA did not

have an easement to park vehicles in the Carpark. However as it was not necessary for my

decision, I declined to make any order on this question and this would make it possible

for CAA to re-litigate on this issue should it obtain evidence of continuing nuisance.</p>

(d) Costs</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 On the question of costs, it was submitted on behalf of the second

to fifth Plaintiffs that the District Judge should not have ordered costs against them on

the ground that they did not pursue their claim for injunction to trial. Their involvement

ended when the court made the consent orders for damages. Among them, the only one who

participated in the trial was the second Plaintiff, Chui. Their counsel submitted that

this was as representative of CAA, as he was its managing director.</p>
<p xmlns="">31 This contention is not supported by the Notes of Evidence of the trial below. On the

first day of the trial counsel for Fokker had applied to strike out the claims of the

third to fifth Plaintiffs. Counsel for the Plaintiffs resisted it on the grounds, <i>inter

alia</i>, that the issue of injunction was still a live one and that the applications of

the third to fifth Plaintiffs were identical. He had submitted that the application was

frivolous because Fokker had more than a year to make the application since the consent

orders on damages were made and had only done so on the first day of trial. In view of

this, I find it quite disingenuous for the Plaintiffs’ counsel to submit before me

that the second to fifth Plaintiffs had not pursued their claim for injunction to trial.

But apart from that, I see no reason why, as they had pursued their claims to trial, the

second to fifth Plaintiffs should not also be liable for the costs.</p>
