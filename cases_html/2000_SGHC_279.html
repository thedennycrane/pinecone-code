        This is an account and inquiry taken pursuant

to a written judgment of the High Court dated 9 November 1998. The trial judge, Warren L H

Khoo J, ordered inquiries and taking of accounts encompassing, among other things,

"the items in the accounts which are disputed by the defendant, as set out in the

annexures in the plaintiff counsel's opening statement" but excluding "items and

matters in respect of which [he had] made findings".</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The "annexures in the plaintiff counsel's

opening statement" referred to in Khoo J's written judgment is a 29 page summary of

the plaintiffs' claim comprising 195 items. For convenience, I shall refer to this as

"the Summary". Items 1 to 24 and 26 to 44 of the Summary describe the money and

goods remitted by the plaintiffs to the defendant in Vietnam. Item 25 of the Summary

refers to a $40,000 housing loan that the trial judge found to be payable by the defendant

to the plaintiffs. Items 45 to 115 of the Summary describe the goods purchased by the

defendant in Vietnam and sent to the plaintiffs. Items 116 to 195 of the Summary are items

in the profit and loss account for the trading arrangement between the plaintiffs and the

defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The taking of accounts began on 13 March 2000

with the examination of the plaintiffs' principal witness, Mr Fung Ah Wah. This proved to

be a tedious exercise, as it was obvious that the aging process and the passage of time

had taken their toll on Mr Fung's memory. Mr Fung could do no more than recite passages

from his affidavit of evidence in chief affirmed on 15 June 1999 but filed only on 23

September 1999, after being guided to those passages by his counsel. Mr Fung's affidavit

filed on 23 September 1999 ("Fung's third affidavit") substantially regurgitated

the contents of his affidavits of evidence in chief filed on 22 October 1997 ("Fung's

first affidavit") and 7 November 1997 ("Fung's second affidavit") for the

trial. On 14 March 2000, the parties agreed that the taking of accounts should continue

without any further oral evidence being led and without any cross-examination of the 2

principal witnesses, namely, Mr Fung and the defendant. Instead, the parties would rely on

materials that were already before the court, such as the affidavits that had been filed

for the trial, the affidavits that had been filed for the taking of accounts, and the

notes of evidence pertaining to the trial. Thereafter, the plaintiffs tendered written

submissions on 31 March 2000 and 7 April 2000 while the defendant tendered written

submissions on 3 April 2000 and 11 April 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        On 30 May 2000, I gave certain directions for

the further conduct of the taking of accounts and delivered grounds of decision containing

certain findings to facilitate compliance with those directions. Those grounds of decision

dealt with all issues except items 116 to 195 of the Summary and the state of the final

account between the parties. I did not deal with those issues because my findings would

necessitate a recomputation of the profit and loss account, and I required submissions on

how my findings would affect items 116 to 195 of the Summary. I also wanted the parties to

explain clearly and in greater detail their contentions in respect of items 116 to 195 of

the Summary. I therefore gave directions for the plaintiffs to redraw the profit and loss

account in accordance with my findings, and for the defendant to file an affidavit that

exhaustively dealt with what he alleged to be discrepancies in the redrawn profit and loss

account. I also allowed the plaintiffs to file an affidavit to respond to the defendant's

allegations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The taking of accounts resumed on 17 October

2000. These grounds of decision deal with the remaining issues (i.e. items 116 to 195 of

the Summary and the state of the final account between the parties), and are to be read in

conjunction with my grounds of decision dated 30 May 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        It is crucial to understand the manner in which

the accounts were maintained by the plaintiffs before one proceeds to consider the

submissions made by the parties on the specific items in the Summary. In this regard, the

following passages from Khoo J's written judgment are instructive:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.    This is an

    action to recover the balance of a trading account between the parties. The plaintiffs are

    a company effectively owned by Mr Fung. ... [Mr Fung and the defendant] arrived at an

    arrangement by which the defendant would source goods in Vietnam and send them to the

    plaintiffs for sale in Singapore and Hong Kong. ... Mr Fung, on the other hand, would send

    goods for which there was a demand in Vietnam. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.    The

    purchases in Vietnam were funded by money sent by Mr Fung or by the proceeds of the sale

    of goods Mr Fung sent to the defendant. The parties agreed to share equally the profit

    made on the goods sent to and from Vietnam. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.    The

    plaintiffs' claim is based on a set of statements sent to the defendant in August 1992.

    The statements are basically in two parts. First, an account of the cash remittances and

    goods sent to the defendant, as well as goods sent from the defendant (the

    "remittances and purchases account"), and, secondly, an account of the profit

    made on goods sent to and from the defendant (profit and loss account). ...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.    Mr Fung says

    that the figures in all these statements were extracted from the [account books].

    According to him, the accounting was done, broadly, as follows. The defendant was credited

    with the cost of the goods sent by the defendant. He was debited with the value of the

    goods as well as the money sent to him in Vietnam. In respect of these goods, if the

    defendant confirmed that he had a buyer who had agreed to buy them at a certain price, the

    defendant would be debited with the price. If there was no confirmed buyer, the defendant

    would be debited with the price payable by the plaintiffs. The values of these goods and

    the monies sent to the defendant were shown as "Remittances" in the accounts. In

    respect of the rattan and other goods sent by the defendant to the plaintiffs, the

    defendant would tell him over the phone how much they cost. Mr Fung would take his word

    for it, and credit him with the amount. The amounts credited to the defendant for all the

    shipments are reflected as "Purchases" in the accounts. ... The profit and loss

    accounts reflect, basically, the difference between the cost of the goods and the sale

    price to third parties. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.    The second

    general point made by the defendant is that there must have been purchases which had taken

    place and which have not been reflected in the plaintiff's accounts. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.    The

    defendant has not been able to point to one single instance of a transaction which has not

    been accounted for. He says that he is handicapped in that he was carrying on the trade

    illegally as he had no licence to do so. So he did not keep any record.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.    It seems to

    me that this is a rather facile explanation. He has admitted to keeping at least some

    invoices ... for the rattan purchases. So he had at least some memory triggers as to any

    purchases which might have been omitted. I also find it difficult to believe that he could

    not have kept some record of the transactions he entered into. We have the position where

    accounts began to be sent to him as long ago as in 1991 but he has simply not been able to

    point to any transaction that has been omitted. Against this, there is the evidence of Mr

    Fung that the transactions were entered in his books as and when they took place. Although

    the account books used were not everything they might have been, it does not necessarily

    mean that they are any the less reliable for that.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.    Another

    point that the defendant makes is that he has not been credited with the full amount of

    the shipments that he had sent to the plaintiffs. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.    Mr Fung's

    answer is that except for the transactions done by means of letters of credit, the

    standing arrangement between the parties right from the beginning was that the defendant

    would simply tell him over the phone how much the goods cost. Mr Fung would take his word

    for it and credit him with the amount. I tend to accept Mr Fung's evidence. ... [The

    defendant] had to pay a commission to the state corporations to treat these goods as

    originating from them. He also had to pay bribes here and there to smoothen the process of

    getting the goods shipped. There would no doubt also be other incidental expenses incurred

    in getting the supplies as well as the expenses of running the business. It would have

    been unwieldy for the defendant to have to account for all these expenses. So I think Mr

    Fung is quite right. ... The defendant, taking the responsibility for all these expenses,

    would simply tell Mr Fung how much he wished to charge for the goods, and Mr Fung would

    credit him accordingly. ...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.    ... I

    accept Mr Fung's evidence that the agreement between the parties was that the plaintiffs

    were to bear the general expenses of running their business in Singapore while the

    defendant was to bear such expenses in Vietnam. The implication is that the defendant

    would factor the expenses of running the business in Vietnam into the amount he asked Mr

    Fung to credit him on the shipments. ... However, in the rather fluid environment in which

    the trading was to be done, I think there was room in the arrangement for expenses

    incurred on extraordinary occurrences, and those not originally contemplated, to be

    allowed to be deducted. ...</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The following points need to be emphasized:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1)    Khoo J

    found that the purchases made by the defendant in Vietnam were funded by money sent by the

    plaintiffs to the defendant or by the proceeds of sale of goods sent by the plaintiffs to

    the defendant. (See paragraph 2 of Khoo J's written judgment.) The defendant did not

    provide any funds for those purchases.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    The account

    of "remittances" maintained by the plaintiffs showed how funds were sent by the

    plaintiffs to the defendant to finance the trading arrangement between the parties. These

    "remittances" could be in the form of cash or goods. When the plaintiffs sent

    goods to the defendant, the quantum of the "remittance" to be debited to the

    defendant (and credited to the plaintiffs) would be the "value of the goods" as

    ascertained in the following manner:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    Normally,

      the amount debited to the defendant (and credited to the plaintiffs) as the "value of

      the goods" would be the amount that the defendant received as proceeds of sale of the

      goods. If this amount exceeded the total costs incurred by the plaintiffs in procuring and

      shipping the goods, the difference would be reflected in the profit and loss account as a

      profit. Conversely, if this amount was less than the total costs of procuring and shipping

      the goods, the difference would be reflected in the profit and loss account as a loss.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)    If there

      was no confirmed buyer for the goods, the amount debited to the defendant (and credited to

      the plaintiffs) as the "value of the goods" would be the actual price payable by

      the plaintiffs for the goods. If there was no sale, there could be no profit or loss; it

      therefore followed that the transaction should be reflected in the profit and loss account

      as a transaction that did not make any profit or loss.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(See paragraphs 6 and 7 of Khoo

    J's written judgment.) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3)    The account

    of "purchases" maintained by the plaintiffs showed the actual amounts that the

    defendant charged the plaintiffs for the goods shipped by the defendant to the plaintiffs.

    The amounts charged by the defendant took into account the amounts that the defendant had

    to pay in respect of commissions and bribes as well as "other incidental expenses

    incurred in getting the supplies" and the "expenses of running the

    business" in Vietnam. Khoo J rejected the defendant's allegation that that he had not

    been credited with the full amount of the shipments that he had sent to the plaintiffs.

    (See paragraphs 26, 27 and 33 of Khoo J's written judgment.) Khoo J also rejected the

    defendant's allegation that "there must have been purchases which had taken place and

    which have not been reflected in the plaintiff's account". Khoo J stressed that the

    defendant "has not been able to point to one single instance of a transaction which

    has not been accounted for" and found it "difficult to believe that [the

    defendant] could not have kept some record of the transactions he entered into". (See

    paragraphs 23 to 25 of Khoo J's written judgment.) For the reasons stated at paragraph 6

    of my grounds of decision dated 30 May 2000, I found that the defendant had been credited

    in full for all "purchases" made by him.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4)    Khoo J

    decided that although "the plaintiffs were to bear the general expenses of running

    their business in Singapore while the defendant was to bear such expenses in

    Vietnam", both parties were entitled to deduct "expenses incurred on

    extraordinary occurrences, and those not originally contemplated". (See paragraph 33

    of Khoo J's written judgment.)</font></p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Heineken Beer (Items 181 to 184

of the Summary)</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        After my grounds of decision were delivered on

30 May 2000, the defendant appealed against my findings in Registrar's Appeal No. 600217

of 2000. He directed his appeal at paragraph 15 of my grounds of decision, which dealt

with items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary. As regards item 15, I found that the plaintiffs

purchased 12,000 cartons of beer at $189,600 (or $15.80 per carton). As regards item 16, I

found that the plaintiffs purchased 22,500 cartons of beer at $355,500 (or $15.80 per

carton). As regards item 29, I found that the plaintiffs purchased 20,000 cartons of beer

at $310,000 (or $15.50 per carton). I had then decided that for these 3 items, the

plaintiffs should be credited with the cost of the 54,500 cartons of beer, i.e. $855,100,

and that these transactions should be reflected in the profit and loss account as

transactions that did not make any profits or losses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        On 21 September 2000, M P H Rubin J allowed the

appeal and ordered that a sum of $177,000 be credited to the defendant in the taking of

the accounts. Rubin J decided as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Inasmuch as the invoice from

    Thai-Pore Enterprise Pte Ltd dated 27 August 1990 reflects a figure of $177,000 payable to

    the Chief Engineer, Mekong Express and that this document admittedly was produced and was

    in the possession of the plaintiff, credit ought to be given to the defendant for the said

    sum of $177,000. In my view, the non-cross-examination of the defendant on this matter

    does not assist the plaintiff much. The plaintiffs are known to be dealing with Thai-Pore

    all along. They could have done much to clarify this issue had they wanted to, very much

    earlier. The issue in relation to this sum was raised at the hearing below but

    unfortunately had not been dealt with. In the premises, the appeal by the defendant is

    allowed only to the extent that a sum of $177,000 be credited to the defendant in the

    taking of the accounts.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        As regards the proper accounting treatment of

this order, it appears from Rubin J's grounds of decision dated 29 November 2000 that what

he intended was for the entry of $855,100 to the plaintiffs' credit in the

"remittances" account to be reduced by the sum of $177,000 to $678,100. (See

paragraphs 17 and 31 of Rubin J's grounds of decision.)</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        During the appeal, the defendant claimed that

he should only be charged $133,000 (instead of $310,000) for the 20,000 cartons of beer

enumerated at item 29 of the Summary. He referred to the invoice dated 27 August 1990 from

Thai-Pore Enterprise Pte Ltd ("Thai-Pore"), which the plaintiffs had exhibited

to support the contention that the 20,000 cartons of beer cost $310,000. The invoice

stated the price of the 20,000 cartons of beer to be $310,000. However, Thai-Pore deducted

the sum of $177,000 from the price on account of "PAYMENT TO BE MADE IN PHNOM PENH TO

CHIEF ENGINEER OF MEKING EXPRESS, MR TAN" and charged the plaintiffs only the balance

sum of $133,000. The defendant claimed that he had arranged for a Cambodian called Yuri to

pay this sum of $177,000 from the proceeds of sale of the beer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        However, the defendant presented a slightly

different picture in his affidavit filed on 11 October 1997, which he relied on for the

taking of accounts. The defendant claimed as follows at paragraph 52 of that affidavit:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I did enter into transactions to

    sell beer sent to me by the Plaintiffs. I remember the beer transactions quite well

    because I remember telling Fung that there was a poor market for such goods in Vietnam. We

    could only make a very small margin if any at all. Fung insisted that we should try to

    sell the beer and simply shipped the beer to me. I had no choice but to accept the goods

    he sent to me in Vietnam, so I did my best to sell all of it. ... There were a total of

    54,500 cartons of beer in the 26 containers. I sold 38,500 cartons to a Cambodian by the

    name of Yuri (or sometimes spelt You Ri). I sold the other 16,000 cartons to another

    Cambodian. I have no documents for the sale to the second Cambodian so I cannot remember

    the actual selling price or whether I was able to collect all the money due. As for the

    sale of beer to Yuri, Yuri wrote the accounts himself in Cambodian and I got the accounts

    translated into Chinese so that I could read them also. ... I remember that Yuri paid a

    total of US$132,447 in cash to me. On Fung's instructions, I then asked Yuri to pay

    US$163,927 directly to a rubber supplier in part-payment of rubber we have bought from the

    supplier. This is the rubber transaction in the "Purchase" portion of Statement

    of Account 1 dated 10.9.90 (by Mekong Express). However, Yuri never paid up the balance of

    US$30,876. I have never been able to collect this money. This is a case of a "bad

    debt" and these were the risks when doing business in Vietnam.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The rubber transaction referred to by the

defendant was the rubber transaction at item 67 of the Summary, for which a sum of

$494,272.50 (or US$279,250 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.77) was credited to the

defendant. Both Khoo J and I found that the defendant had been given full credit for this

transaction. The defendant also exhibited what he alleged to be an English translation of

the accounts prepared by Yuri. According to this document:</font></p>

    the defendant a balance of US$30,876.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        The thrust of the defendant's evidence as

contained in his affidavit filed on 11 October 1997 was that the defendant had sold 38,500

cartons of beer to Yuri at a price of US$327,250 and was unable to account for the

proceeds of sale of the remaining 16,000 cartons of beer. The defendant further claimed

that the total value that he received from Yuri for the 38,500 cartons of beer was only

US$296,374, of which US$132,447 was paid in cash and US$163,927 was paid to the rubber

supplier. The defendant alleged that he was "never ... able" to collect the

balance of US$30,876, but he did not give a reason why this was so. The defendant did not

allege in any of his four affidavits referred to during the taking of accounts (the

defendant's affidavits filed on 11 October 1997 and 12 May 1998, and two affidavits filed

on 23 February 2000) that the 20,000 cartons of beer under item 29 of the Summary were

worth only $133,000 (instead of $310,000). The argument that the defendant should not be

charged the $177,000 allegedly paid to the rubber supplier first surfaced in his counsel's

written submissions filed on 3 April 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        As the defendant did not deny receiving and

selling the 54,500 cartons of beer, the burden was on him to account for the proceeds of

sale of these goods. Even if the defendant's allegations were accepted at face value, he

would only have accounted for part of the proceeds of sale for 38,500 cartons of beer. It

was not enough for the defendant to claim that he could not remember the actual selling

price or whether he was able to collect all the money due. Nor was it sufficient for the

defendant to simply say that he was unable to collect the sum of US$30,876 from Yuri

without explaining what efforts he made to collect the debt. The defendant failed to

account at all for the proceeds of sale of the remaining 16,000 cartons of beer, which

might well have been sold at a tidy profit. In his affidavits, the defendant did not

distinguish between the cartons of beer referred to in items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary,

so it was impossible to tell whether the proceeds of sale that were unaccounted for

related to item 15, item 16 or item 29 of the Summary. All things considered, the

defendant failed to satisfy me on the evidence that he had in fact sold the 54,500 cartons

of beer at a global loss. The plaintiffs also failed to prove that the defendant had sold

the beer at a profit. It was for this reason that I had earlier directed that in so far as

the "remittance" for beer was concerned, the plaintiffs should be credited with

the cost of the beer, i.e. $855,100, and that the beer transactions be reflected in the

profit and loss account as transactions that did not make any profit or loss.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        In so deciding, I had noted the defendant's

submission that the $177,000 referred to in the Thai-Pore invoice was paid to the chief

engineer of the Mekong Express by or on behalf of the defendant. However, when I wrote my

grounds of decision dated 30 May 2000, I did not think it was necessary for me to comment

on this allegation. Even if the defendant had utilised part of the proceeds from the sale

of the beer to pay the chief engineer of the Mekong Express, this did not diminish the

value of the goods received by the defendant from the plaintiffs. The sole function of the

account of "remittances" was to show the value of the goods and cash sent by the

plaintiffs to the defendant for use in their joint venture. The account of

"remittances" was not designed to show how the proceeds of sale were utilised.

The utilisation of funds received by the defendant for the purpose of purchases would be

reflected in the account of "purchases". The plaintiffs had, under item 67 of

the Summary, already given the defendant full credit for all sums paid by the defendant

for the Mekong Express rubber. The only way in which the account of

"remittances" could, for a specific item, reflect an amount that was less than

the cost of the goods represented by that item was if the goods were sold at a loss by the

defendant. Only then would the value received by the defendant in respect of the goods be

less than the cost of the goods.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        Putting the defendant's case in relation to the

Thai-Pore invoice at its highest, it simply meant that a total of US$163,927 from the

proceeds of sale of the beer was utilised in part-payment of the price of US$279,250 paid

for the Mekong Express Rubber. There was no evidence that the defendant paid for the beer

out of his own pocket. Khoo J found (at paragraph 2 of his written judgment) that all of

the defendant's purchases were funded by the plaintiffs. There was also no evidence that

the 20,000 cartons of beer in item 29 of the Summary were acquired at a more than 50%

discount of $177,000. The Thai-Pore invoice merely indicated a set-off between the

plaintiffs and Thai-Pore with respect to a payment of $177,000 to be made on behalf of

Thai-Pore. The total cost of the beer to the plaintiffs would still be $310,000, even if

$177,000 of the price was settled by means of a set-off. Thus, in my opinion, even if the

sum of $177,000 reflected in the Thai-Pore invoice was in fact paid to the chief engineer

of the Mekong Express from the proceeds of sale of the beer by the defendant to Yuri, as a

matter of accounting, this would not have resulted in the "remittances" to be

credited to the plaintiffs in respect of items 15, 16 and 29 of the Summary being reduced

by the sum of $177,000 to $678,100. The defendant received goods worth a total of

$855,100.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18

        Be that as it may, if the

"remittances" to be credited to the plaintiffs in respect of the beer are to be

reduced by a sum of $177,000, I would have to treat the value of the goods received by the

defendant as having been reduced to $678,100 from their actual cost of $855,100. If the

value of the goods received by the defendant is less than the cost of the goods to the

plaintiffs, it follows that the transaction was effected at a loss. Accordingly, if the

plaintiffs are to be credited with the sum of only $678,100 in respect of items, 15, 16

and 29 of the Summary, the corresponding beer transactions at items 182, 183 and 184 of

the Summary should now be reflected in the profit and loss account as transactions that

made a total loss of $177,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        Item 181 of the Summary pertains to a separate

sale of 29,250 cartons of beer for which the plaintiffs claim to have made a profit of

$15,824.80. The defendant did not dispute item 181 of the Summary in his affidavit filed

on 20 September 2000. I therefore accept that the plaintiffs made a profit of $15,824.80

on this transaction. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        In the circumstances, I find that the beer

transactions resulted in a total loss of $161,175.20, calculated from the difference

between the profit of $15,824.80 for item 181 of the Summary and the total loss of

$177,000 for items 182 to 184 of the Summary.</font></p>

        On 30 May 2000, I ordered the defendant to file

an affidavit that exhaustively listed the specific discrepancies which the defendant

alleged were present in the profit and loss account and to provide full particulars of the

discrepancies with supporting documentary evidence, if any. The defendant filed an

affidavit on 20 September 2000 to comply with this order. I shall therefore confine myself

to dealing with the objections raised in this affidavit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        <u>Item 116 - Song Tien I.</u> The defendant's

complaint was that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give discounts of US$750.55 for

dampness and US$825.27 for undersized goods in their invoice to the purchasers of the

rattan ostensibly because these goods were "specially graded and selected by Chew

Moon Tong". As Chew Moon Tong was not called as a witness at and did not file any

affidavit for the taking of the accounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's

bare allegations concerning the quality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to

suggest that the discounts were not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business.

Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made a loss of $6,425.30 as stated at item 116

of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        <u>Item 117 - Song Tien I.</u> The defendant

complained that the plaintiffs imported 34.56 metric tons but sold only 33.94 metric tons

of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The plaintiffs'

credit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs' invoice

evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold only 33.94

metric tons of rattan. The weight of 34.56 metric tons appears on the Singapore customs

declaration form while the weight of 34.65 metric tons appears on the marine premium note.

The plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11

October 2000 that the rattan was still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost

weight while being transported to Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods

were sold in Singapore had to be agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There

was no evidence that the plaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There

was also no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo

sold was the same cargo that the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one

agreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that

the plaintiffs made a profit of $1,165.00 as stated at item 117 of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24

        <u>Item 118 - Song Tien II.</u> The defendant

tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The

plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs'

invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold only

25.760 metric tons of rattan. The weight of 26.303 metric tons appears on two payment

vouchers, the bill of lading and the Singapore customs declaration form while the weight

of 28.940 metric tons appears on the marine premium note. The plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah

explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that the rattan was

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26

        <u>Item 120 - Song Tien I.</u> The defendant

tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The

plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the importation of the rattan and the plaintiffs'

invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold

31.578 metric tons of rattan. Although the bill of lading states the gross weight of the

goods to be 34.055 metric tons, and this weight is also reflected in a notice of arrival

and a payment voucher, the weight stated in the Singapore customs declaration form is 32

metric tons while the weight of 31.140 metric tons appears on the marine premium note. The

plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October

        <u>Item 121 - Victory Vigour.</u> The

defendant's first complaint was that 171 metric tons of rattan were shipped, but the

plaintiffs only sold 169.52 metric tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account

for the difference. The plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the acquisition of the rattan

and the plaintiffs' invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs

received and sold rattan having a total net weight of only 169.520 metric tons. The

plaintiffs were never asked to explain why the title for both the credit note and the

invoice referred to "171 M.TONS - VIETNAM RATTAN SHIPMENT PER SS. "VIGOUR

VICTORY" FROM HCM TO HONGKONG". There was no evidence that the net weight of the

cargo received in Hong Kong was 171 metric tons, apart from the defendant's bare

allegation. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to

different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.

If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the

invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

goods were sold "F.O.B." or free on board, so the plaintiffs were not entitled

to make deductions for freight or crane charges. As the plaintiffs did not provide any

explanation for these charges even though they were given the opportunity to, I accept

that the disputed crane charge of US$3,756.65 referred to in credit note TW/8/90 dated 31

May 1990 and the disputed freight charge of US$10,227.75 referred to in invoice 085/90

dated 31 May 1990 should not be reflected in the accounts. According to invoice 085/90,

the 169.520 metric tons of rattan were sold at US$106,751.91. According to credit note

TW/8/90, the 169.520 metric tons of rattan were purchased at US$93,556.56. Accordingly,

the profit made on this transaction should be the difference of US$13,195.35 or

S$24,279.44 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.8400 stated on the invoice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29

        I do not understand the defendant's complaint

that there was "no price stated for the sale by the Plaintiffs". The plaintiffs'

invoice 085/90 clearly stated that the goods were sold at US$10,227.75. As regards the

"double entry" submission, as Khoo J specifically found (at paragraph 27 of his

written judgment) that the plaintiffs credited the defendant with the full amount that the

defendant charged for the goods, and as I had on 30 May 2000 found that the defendant had

been credited in full for all "purchases" made by him on the plaintiffs' behalf,

there was no basis for making a corresponding accounting double entry alteration to the

"purchases" account.</font></p>

complaint was that 163.56 metric tons of rattan were shipped, but the plaintiffs only sold

145.4355 metric tons of rattan, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the

difference. The plaintiffs' credit note evidencing the acquisition of the rattan and the

plaintiffs' invoice evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received

and sold rattan having a total weight of only 145.4385 metric tons. The plaintiffs were

dated 23 July 1990 should not be reflected in the accounts. According to invoice 101/90,

the 78.400 metric tons of rattan were sold at US$46,581.08. According to credit note

TW/15/90, the 78.400 metric tons of rattan were purchased at US$38,741.08. Accordingly,

the profit made on this transaction should be the difference of US$7,840 or S$14,112 at

the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.8000 stated on the invoice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35

        As regards the "double entry"

submission, as Khoo J specifically found (at paragraph 27 of his written judgment) that

the plaintiffs credited the defendant with the full amount that the defendant charged for

the goods, and as I had on 30 May 2000 found that the defendant had been credited in full

for all "purchases" made by him on the plaintiffs' behalf, there was no basis

for making a corresponding accounting double entry alteration to the "purchases"

account.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36

        <u>Item 124 - Song Tien I.</u> The defendant

complained that the plaintiffs did not explain the "shortfall" of 2.14 metric

tons referred to in credit note TW/13/90 dated 15 August 1990 (and, I should add, invoice

099/90 dated 20 July 1990) or the 25% deduction for "bad quality". However,

there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the shortfall or

that these discounts were not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. As

regards the defendant's comment that the invoice pre-dated the arrival of the vessel, I

fail to see how anything turns on the date of the invoice. Accordingly, I accept that the

plaintiffs made a loss of $1,617.23 as stated at item 124 of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37

        <u>Item 125 - Bunga Bindang.</u> The defendant

complained that the plaintiffs did not explain the "loss in weight" of 0.914

metric tons referred to in credit note TW/17/90 and invoice 109/90. However, there was no

evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that

the discount was not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I

accept that the plaintiffs made a profit of $5,779.37 as stated in item 125 of the

Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38

        <u>Item 126 - Kah Hang.</u> The defendant's

complaint was that the buyers were responsible for freight, so the plaintiffs were not

entitled to make a deduction of US$1,606.64 on account of "freight paid on our

behalf" in invoice 106/90. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this

deduction and the other transactions set out in that invoice, even though they were given

the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this

item. According to invoice 106/90, the 36.209 metric tons of rattan were sold at

US$30,777.65. According to credit note TW/16/90, the 36.209 metric tons of rattan were

purchased at US$27,156.75. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be the

difference of US$3,620.90 or S$6,408.99 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700 stated on

the invoice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39

        <u>Item 127 - Saigon Gate; Item 128 - Mimosa.</u>

The defendant did not dispute items 127 and 128 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on

20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made profits of $1,912.72 and

$2,252.87 as stated at items 127 and 128 respectively of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40

        <u>Item 129 - Saigon Gate.</u> The defendant

submitted that the plaintiffs should "account for the loss weight" in invoice

127/90 of "27.081 - 25.030" or 2.051 metric tons. The plaintiffs' credit note

TW/22/90 evidencing the acquisition of the rattan and the plaintiffs' invoice 127/90

evidencing the sale of the rattan show that the plaintiffs received and sold rattan having

a total weight of only 25.030 metric tons. The plaintiffs were never asked to explain why

the title for both the credit note and the invoice referred to "27.081M.TONS".

There was no evidence that the actual weight of the cargo received in Singapore was 27.081

metric tons, apart from the defendant's bare allegation. The plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah

explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that the rattan was

still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight while being transported to

Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were sold in Singapore had to be

agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was also no evidence to contradict

the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the weight at which the cargo was sold was one

agreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that

the plaintiffs made a profit of $9,107.69 as stated at item 129 of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41

        <u>Item 130 - Ex Stock.</u> The defendant

complained about deductions for freight that were made by the plaintiffs. As the

plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions, even though they were

given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to

this item. The deductions of US$3,249.50 and US$875 referred to in invoice 131/90

(amounting to a total of US$4,124.50 or S$7,300.36 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700

stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.

Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$19,422.23 (total of

S$12,121.87 + S$7,300.36).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42

        <u>Item 131 - Saigon Gate.</u> The defendant's

complaint was that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give a discount of S$6,118.38 for

bad quality ostensibly because the goods were graded and selected by Goh Chee Kian. As Goh

Chee Kian was not called as a witness at and did not file any affidavit for the taking of

the accounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's bare allegations concerning

the quality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that the discount was

not given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that the

plaintiffs made a profit of $5,599.05 as stated at item 131 of the Summary.</font></p>

plaintiffs made profits of $1,233.45, $4,785.07 and $1,757.51 as stated at items 132, 133

and 134 respectively of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44

        <u>Item 135 - Nha Trang.</u> The defendant's

first complaint was that the plaintiffs "claim a loss weight of 11.6MT without

explanation". However, there was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were

responsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona fide in the

ordinary course of business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs had split up

the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the

cargo that was shipped.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45

        The defendant made two other complaints. First,

he alleged that "freight is to be paid by the buyer and there is no reason to deduct

this from the price of rattan sold". Second, he queried a deduction of US$1,200 which

was made without any explanation whatsoever. As the plaintiffs did not provide any

explanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject

the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. According to invoice

148/90, the rattan was sold at US$36,012. According to credit note TW/31/90, the same

rattan was purchased at US$21,836. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should

be the difference of US$14,176 or S$24,732.87 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7447

profits of $4,704.70 and $5,983.09 as stated at items 136 and 137 respectively of the

Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47

        <u>Item 138 - Louisa.</u> The defendant

complained that "freight was to be paid by the buyer", and "there is

therefore no reason to deduct freight from the price". As the plaintiffs did not

provide any explanation for this deduction even though they were given the opportunity to,

I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. According to

invoice 163/91, the rattan was sold at US$21,600. According to credit note TW/37/91, the

same rattan was purchased at US$16,550. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction

should be the difference of US$5,050 or S$8,837.50 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7500

stated on the invoice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48

        <u>Item 139 - Singagold.</u> The defendant's

complained about "loss weight of 5.175 MT" in relation to credit note TW/38/91

and invoice 165/91, and about "loss weight of 2.67 MT" in relation to credit

note TW/40/01 and invoice 166/91. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the

plaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona

had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49

        The defendant also complained that freight of

US$5,546.88 reflected on invoice 165/91 and US$3,060 reflected on invoice 166/91 were to

be paid by the buyer, and not the plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did not provide any

explanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject

the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The deductions of

US$5,546.88 referred to in invoice 165/91 (or S$9,888.42 at the exchange rate of US$1 =

S$1.7827 stated on the invoice) and US$3,060 referred to in invoice 166/91 (or S$5,455.06

at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7827 stated on the invoice) should be added to the

profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should

be S$31,063.42 (total of S$15,719.94 + S$9,888.42 + S$5,455.06).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50

note TW 41/91 and invoice 171/91. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the

plaintiffs were responsible for the loss in weight or that the discount was not given bona

had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51

        The defendant's second complaint was that

freight of US$6,300 reflected on invoice 170/91 and freight of US$3,074.40 reflected on

invoice 171/91 were to be paid by the buyer and not the plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did

not provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were given the

opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item.

The deductions of US$6,300 referred to in invoice 170/91 (or S$11,155.41 at the exchange

171/91 (or S$5,443.84 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7707 stated on the invoice)

should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52

        The defendant's third complaint was that the

plaintiffs made an unexplained deduction of US$1,200 in invoice 170/91. As the plaintiffs

opportunity to, the deduction of US$1,200 referred to in invoice 170/91 (or S$2,124.84 at

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53

        <u>Item 141 - Bunga Bindang.</u> The defendant

complained that the plaintiffs were not entitled to give a discount of $12,380.98 on

account of "claim on quality" in credit note TW/45/91 and invoice 174/91,

ostensibly because Goh Chee Kian was stationed in Vietnam to ensure quality. As Goh Chee

Kian was not called as a witness at and did not file any affidavit for the taking of the

accounts, there was no evidence to support the defendant's bare allegations concerning the

quality of the goods. Further, there was no evidence to suggest that the discount was not

given bona fide in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that the

plaintiffs made a profit of $15,281.66 as stated at item 141 of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54

        <u>Item 142 - Louisa.</u> The defendant's first

complaint was that 96.607 metric tons of rattan were shipped but only 96.083 metric tons

of rattan were sold. He wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference of 0.524

metric tons. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to

different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.

If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the

invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

trucking and unloading charges of US$646.12 and freight charges of US$6,569.27 reflected

on invoice 167/91 were unjustified because they were payable by the buyer and not the

plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even

though they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit

in relation to this item. The deductions of US$646.12 (or S$1,150.09 at the exchange rate

of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) and US$6,569.27 (or S$11,693.30 at the exchange

rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56

        <u>Item 143 - Song Thu.</u> The defendant's

first complaint states: "For Credit Note No. TW/46/91 we were to have purchased 50MT

(see page 444) and the Bill of Lading (page 451) however the tonnage stated is only 48 MT.

There is a shortfall of 2 tons which the Plaintiffs have to account for the shortfall and

its price and profit." This allegation was not only garbled but also misconceived as

the corresponding invoice 173/91 clearly showed that the plaintiffs sold 50 metric tons of

rattan at US$24,500. There was therefore no "shortfall" that the plaintiffs

failed to account for.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57

        The defendant's second complaint states:

"Again for Credit Note No. TW/46/9-A (page 445) we were to have purchased 35.50 MT

(see Bill of Lading on page 453) but only 31.79 MT was acknowledged by the Plaintiffs. The

Plaintiffs must therefore account for the shortfall of 2.29MT and its price and

profit." The plaintiffs' credit note TW/46/9-A evidencing the acquisition of the

rattan and the plaintiffs' invoice 173/91-A evidencing the sale of the rattan show that

the plaintiffs received and sold rattan having a total weight of only 31.79 metric tons.

There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up that particular cargo for sale to

different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.

If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the

invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">58

        The defendant's third complaint was that the

buyer under invoice 172/91 and US$3,000 from the sum payable by the buyer under invoice

173/91, when freight was payable by the buyers. As the plaintiffs did not provide any

explanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject

the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The deductions of US$3,000

(or S$5,340 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on invoice 172/91) and US$3,000

(or S$5,340 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on invoice 173/91) should be

added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">59

        The defendant's fourth complaint was that the

sum payable by the buyer under invoice 173/91-A. As the plaintiffs did not provide any

explanation for this deduction even though they were given the opportunity to, the

deduction of US$1,589.50 (or S$2,781.62 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7500 stated on

invoice 173/91-A) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly,

the profit made on this transaction should be S$31,779.76 (total of S$18,318.14 + S$5,340

defendant's first complaint pertained to a "loss of weight of 0.69 MT" reflected

that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the

invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped. If the entire cargo was sold

in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the invoice, any apparent

discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">61

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$2,645.20 for freight from the sum payable

by the buyer under invoice 175/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by the

buyer as the cargo was sold on an "f.o.b. basis" with freight collect. As the

plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even though they were given

the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this

item. The deduction of US$2,645.20 (or S$4,682 at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7700

stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs.

Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$9,185.61 (total of S$4,503.61

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">62

        <u>Item 145 - Bunga Bindang.</u> The defendant

complained that the weight of the cargo stated in the bill of lading was 28.77 metric tons

whereas the weight of the cargo according to the corresponding credit notes and invoices

was only 27.3 metric tons, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference. The

plaintiffs' Mr Fung Ah Wah explained at paragraph 8.1 of his affidavit filed on 11 October

2000 that the rattan was still moist when purchased, but had dried up and lost weight

while being transported to Singapore. He added that the weight at which the goods were

sold in Singapore had to be agreed to by the buyers before they made payment. There was no

evidence that the plaintiffs split up the cargo for sale to different buyers. There was

also no evidence to contradict the plaintiffs' explanation. I accept that the cargo sold

was the same cargo that the plaintiffs received, and that the reduced weight was one

agreed to with the buyer in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, I accept that

the plaintiffs made a profit of $1,969.03 as stated at item 145 of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">63

had split up the cargo for sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">64

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$4,561.44 for freight from the sum payable

by the purchaser under invoice 179/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by

the purchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even

though they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit

in relation to this item. The deduction of US$4,561.44 (or S$8,072.84 at the exchange rate

of US$1 = S$1.7698 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the

plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$12,578.24 (total

complained about "loss in weight of 7.04 MT" and a "consequent reduction in

price of US$859.14" in invoice 184/91. The defendant also complained about the

deduction of US$8,217.30 for freight as, according to him, freight was payable by the

purchaser. There was no evidence to suggest that the plaintiffs were responsible for the

loss in weight or that the weight discount was not given bona fide in the ordinary course

of business. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for

sale to different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was

shipped. However, as the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for the US$859.14

deduction or the deduction on account of freight, even though they were given the

opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item.

The deductions of US$859.14 and US$8,217.30 (or S$1,524.11 and S$14,577.49 respectively at

        <u>Item 148 - Hoi Long.</u> The defendant's

first complaint was that the plaintiffs sold only 41.27 metric tons of rattan although 50

metric tons were shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for a shortfall of 8.73

metric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">67

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$690 for freight from the sum payable by the

purchaser under invoice 185/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by the

purchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even

in relation to this item. The deduction of US$690 (or S$1,224.06 at the exchange rate of

complained that the plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$753.45 on account of a

cross-claim by the purchaser from the sum payable by the purchaser under invoice 183/91.

The defendant also contended that the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct a sum of

US$3,033.03 on account of freight, because freight was payable by the buyer. As the

plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were

given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to

this item. The deductions of US$753.45 and US$3,033.03 (or S$1,341.14 and S$5,398.79

respectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7800 stated on the invoice) should be

of 4.861 metric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">71

        The defendant's second complaint was that the

plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$2,935.92 for freight from the sum payable

by the purchaser under invoice 190/91. The defendant claimed that freight was payable by

the purchaser. As the plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for this deduction even

though they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit

in relation to this item. The deduction of US$2,935.92 (or S$5,208.32 at the exchange rate

of US$1 = S$1.7740 stated on the invoice) should be added to the profit computed by the

plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this transaction should be S$6,663.82 (total

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">72

        <u>Item 152 - Hai Win.</u> The defendant's

first complaint was that the plaintiffs sold only 77.084 metric tons of rattan although

of 15.313 metric tons. However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the

price stated in the invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">73

        The defendant made two other complaints. First,

he complained that the plaintiffs had wrongfully deducted a sum of US$10,385.35 on account

of a cross-claim by the purchaser from the sum payable by the purchaser under invoice

193/91. Second, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct a

sum of US$6,283 on account of freight, because freight was payable by the buyer. As the

plaintiffs did not provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were

given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to

this item. The deductions of US$10,385.35 and US$6,283 (or S$18,434.00 and S$11,152.32

respectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7750 stated on the invoice) should be

added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit made on this

transaction should be S$36,801.04 (total of S$7,214.72 + S$18,434.00 + S$11,152.32).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74

        <u>Item 153 - Izvesta; Item 154 - Bunga

Bindang.</u> The defendant did not dispute items 153 and 154 of the Summary in his

affidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made

profits of $2,871.24 and $4,084.53 as stated at items 153 and 154 respectively of the

Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">75

        <u>Item 155 - Quy Nhon 2.</u> The defendant's

first complaint was that the rattan sold by the plaintiffs under invoice 199/91 was less

than what was shipped, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for the difference.

However, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had split up the cargo for sale to

different buyers or that the invoice pertained to only part of the cargo that was shipped.

If the entire cargo was sold in the ordinary course of business at the price stated in the

invoice, any apparent discrepancy in weight was irrelevant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">76

        The defendant also made the following

complaints. First, the plaintiffs were not entitled to deduct freight charges of

US$3,923.05 under invoice 198/91 and US$4,374.40 under invoice 199/91, because freight was

payable by the buyer. Second, the plaintiffs made an unjustified deduction of US$1,080 in

invoice 199/91. Third, the plaintiffs had, in invoice 199/91, deducted freight charges for

shipping cargo from Hong Kong to China amounting to US$356.23. As the plaintiffs did not

provide any explanation for these deductions even though they were given the opportunity

to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of profit in relation to this item. The

deductions of US$3,923.05, US$4,374.40, US$1,080 and US$356.23 (or S$6,920.26, S$7,716.44,

S$1,905.12 and S$628.39 respectively at the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7640 stated on

invoice 198/91 and calculated from the S$ to US$ ratio of the bottomline in invoice

199/91) should be added to the profit computed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the profit

made on this transaction should be S$16,458.04 (S$6,920.26 + S$7,716.44 + S$1,905.12 +

S$628.39 - S$712.17).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">77

        The defendant also referred to invoice 199/91

and alleged that "the Plaintiffs have not accounted for the sale in China".

However, the contents of invoice 199/91 do not go so far as to suggest that there was a

separate transaction in China distinct from the sale referred to invoice 199/91.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">78

        <u>Item 156 - Nhatrang 6.</u> The defendant

raised various objections to the two main documents in support of the plaintiffs'

computation for item 156, namely credit note TW/65/91 (which is wrongly labelled as an

invoice) and invoice 201/91. As the plaintiffs did not address any of these objections

even though they were given the opportunity to, I reject the plaintiff's computation of

loss in relation to this item. In so far as invoice 201/91 is concerned, I do not think

the plaintiffs are entitled to make any deduction on account of freight amounting to

US$8,132.34, since the plaintiffs have not disputed the defendant's allegation that the

freight charges should be payable by the purchaser. Nor should there be any deduction on

account of "claim on loss in weight" amounting to US$38,781.40. No loss in

weight is disclosed in the invoice and no explanation has been given for this claim. As

regards credit note TW/65/91, I agree that no deduction should be made from the cost of

the goods on account of "charges claimed by Alan". No explanation has been given

as to what who Alan is or what these charges pertain to. According to invoice 201/91, the

goods were sold at US$100,160.57, disregarding the deductions for freight and "claim

on loss in weight". According to credit note TW/65/91, the total cost of the goods

was US$74,060.10, disregarding the "charges claimed by Alan". The marine premium

note exhibited shows that the plaintiffs paid insurance premium of $320 for this shipment.

I therefore find that the profit made on this transaction is US$26,100.47 or S$42,804.77

(using the exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.6400 stated on the invoice) less the sum of S$320,

i.e. S$42,484.77 (S$42,804.77 - S$320).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">79

        <u>Item 157 - Song Chang 505.</u> The

defendant's complaint is that there are no supporting documents at all to justify the

plaintiff's assertion that this transaction resulted in a loss of $10,696.05. As the

plaintiffs did not provide any evidence that the transaction did in fact result in a loss,

and the defendant did not provide any evidence to show that the transaction resulted in a

profit, I find that this is a transaction which did not make any profit or loss.

Accordingly, the transaction should be reflected as having made a profit/loss of $0.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">80

        <u>Item 158 - Song Chang 505; Item 159 -

Laclong Quan.</u> The defendant did not dispute items 158 and 159 of the Summary in his

affidavit filed on 20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made

profits of $397.66 and $2,579.40 as stated at items 158 and 159 respectively of the

Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">81

        In summary, I find that the rattan transactions

resulted in a total profit of $506,609.82.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">82

        According to the Summary, the transactions

pertaining to Honda motor bikes at items 160, 161 and 162 made profits of $6,216.87,

$10,632.45 and $5,296.25 respectively. In the light of paragraphs 8 and 11 of my grounds

of decision dated 30 May 2000, where I directed that the remittances credited to the

plaintiffs should be reduced by the sums of $22,423.88 and $7,855.26 respectively, the

profit made on these transactions should correspondingly be reduced by these amounts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">83

        The defendant disputed 3 items of expenses in

relation to the Honda motor bike transactions, namely, commission payments amounting to

$3,206.25 (in respect of item 160), $958 (in respect of item 161) and $2,232 (in respect

of item 162). The defendant objected on the ground that these expenses were included

"without stating the purpose of these payment and without any evidence of any such

payments". I agree that the alleged commission payments of $958 and $2,232 should be

excluded from the computation as there are no payment vouchers or other supporting

documents to explain why and to whom these payments were made. However, the payment of

$3,206.25 was supported by a payment voucher exhibited at page 63 of Fung Ah Wah's

affidavit filed on 22 October 1997 and also at page 74 of Fung Ah Wah's affidavit filed on

23 September 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">84

        In the circumstances, I find that the Honda

motor bike transactions resulted in a total loss of $4,943.57, calculated as follows:</font></p>

        The expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in

acquiring the total of 81 containers listed at items 163, 164, 165, 167, 168, 169, 170 and

171 of the Summary as reflected in the handwritten notes found at pages 582 to 584 of

Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at pages 592 to 594 of Fung's third affidavit, are

matched by the "purchases" credited to the defendant at items 45, 52, 55, 61,

63, 65, 69 and 89 respectively of the Summary. The expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in

acquiring the 18 containers listed at item 166 of the Summary as reflected in the

handwritten note found at page 582 of Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at page 592

of Fung's third affidavit, are matched by the "purchases" credited to the

defendant at items 57 and 58 of the Summary. There is nothing to contradict Mr Fung's

evidence that there were no supporting documents evidencing the sale of the containers

listed at items 163 to 168 of the Summary, so the sales figures reflected in the

handwritten notes found at pages 582 and 583 of Fung's first affidavit, and duplicated at

pages 592 and 593 of Fung's third affidavit, are the best evidence of the price at which

those containers were sold. I have verified, from my examination of the available

documents, that the profits set out at items 163 to 171 of the Summary have been correctly

calculated. Accordingly, I find that the profits earned from the container transactions at

items 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170 and 171 of the Summary are $15,146.60,

containers disclosed by the plaintiffs, and he wanted the plaintiffs to account for them.

However, apart from the defendant's bare allegations which were disputed by the

plaintiffs, there was no evidence whatsoever that the containers used to transport the

goods acquired by the defendant for the plaintiffs were in fact sold separately from the

goods transported in the containers. All the containers acquired by the defendant for sale

by the plaintiffs were accounted for in the "purchases" account (at items 45,

        I therefore find that the coffee transaction

made a loss of S$10,168.90. In so deciding, I have rejected the plaintiffs' contention

that a further sum of S$1,316.00 should be deducted on account of my decision in relation

to item 8 of the Summary. Although the alleged "refund pertaining to overpriced

coffee" was reflected in the plaintiffs' summary of the coffee transaction at page

585 of Fung's first affidavit, it is clear that this figure was not taken into account

when the plaintiffs computed their loss for this transaction at S$14,173.94. Also, having

regard to the manner in which I have computed the plaintiffs' loss for the coffee

transaction, there is no basis for making a further deduction of S$1,316. I have similarly

rejected the defendant's contention that the profit should be increased by S$1,316. It was

the plaintiffs' case that the refund of S$1,316 was collected by the defendant from the

supplier of the coffee. As the defendant denied collecting the sum of S$1,316, it followed

that:</font></p>

only complaint was that there was "no evidence of import tax". If by this the

defendant is referring to the payment of $1,388.59 to Intraco Limited for cess duty, then

this objection is unfounded, as there is no evidence that cess duty is not payable simply

because the goods are re-exported to a Malaysian party. Indeed, Mr Fung states at

paragraph 11.6 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that "Intraco Cess had to be

paid for goods brought into Singapore even if it is then re-exported". However, there

was an entry for $40 marked "Imp" in the summary for the Saigon Gate rubber

transaction found at page 597 of Fung's first affidavit. There were no supporting

documents for this entry. If the defendant was referring to this entry when he complained

that there was "no evidence of import tax", then I agree that this entry should

be disregarded in computing the profit for this transaction. I therefore find that the

this shipment of rubber was concerned, there was ample evidence adduced at the trial to

show that the rubber was acquired through the defendant at a price of US$279,250 (or

S$494,272.50 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.77). The defendant was in fact credited

with the sum of S$494,272.50 in the "purchases" account at item 67 of the

Summary. However, the plaintiffs did not produce any documentary evidence pertaining to

the sale of the Mekong Express rubber. Item 177 of the Summary discloses no less than 5

separate sales of the Mekong Express rubber. One would have expected the plaintiffs to

issue invoices in respect of these transactions. However, none of these invoices were

disclosed to the court. The plaintiffs have also failed to provide any confirmation under

oath or affirmation of the sale price for each separate transaction in which the

plaintiffs sold the Mekong Express rubber. The plaintiffs did no more than exhibit a

summary of the Mekong Express transactions at page 598 of Fung's first affidavit and page

608 of Fung's third affidavit. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy

me that they did in fact make a loss of $10,250.53 on the Mekong Express transactions. The

defendant has also failed to satisfy me that the plaintiffs made a profit on the Mekong

Express transactions. I therefore direct that the transactions dealt with under item 177

of the Summary should be reflected as transactions that did not make a profit or loss.</font></p>

        <u>Item 178 - Bunga Bindang.</u> The

defendant's only complaint was that there was "no evidence of import tax". If by

this the defendant is referring to the payment of $442.36 to Intraco Limited for cess

duty, then this objection is unfounded, as there is no evidence that cess duty is not

payable simply because the goods are re-exported to a Malaysian party. Indeed, Mr Fung

states at paragraph 11.6 of his affidavit filed on 11 October 2000 that "Intraco Cess

had to be paid for goods brought into Singapore even if it is then re-exported".

However, there was an entry for $40 marked "Import Permit" in the summary for

the Saigon Gate rubber transaction found at page 599 of Fung's first affidavit. There were

no supporting documents for this entry. If the defendant was referring to this entry when

he complained that there was "no evidence of import tax", then I agree that this

entry should be disregarded in computing the profit for this transaction. I therefore find

that the loss on item 176 of the Summary should only be S$20,986.41 instead of

S$21,026.41.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">101

        <u>Item 179 - La Femme; Item 180 - Kinyru.</u>

The defendant did not dispute items 179 and 180 of the Summary in his affidavit filed on

20 September 2000. Accordingly, I accept that the plaintiffs made profits of $13,660.56

and $24,341.64 as stated at items 179 and 180 respectively of the Summary.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">102

        At paragraph 28 of the defendant's affidavit

filed on 20 September 2000, the defendant admitted to all the expenses except items 192,

193 and 194 of the Summary. The undisputed expenses at items 185 to 191 and 195 of the

Summary amount to a total of $12,431.42.</font></p>

        <u>Item 192 - Haw Par claim judgment sum; Item

Ltd ("Haw Par") claim and judgment costs is set out at paragraph 55 of Fung's

second affidavit, paragraph 96 of Fung's third affidavit and exhibit FAW-26 in both

affidavits. The defendant's complained that these two items of the Summary were expenses

incurred in the course of a business transaction falling within the scope of the parties'

joint venture, and the plaintiffs had failed to account for the profits earned from that

transaction. The defendant submitted that these expenses should be deducted from the

profits earned from this transaction, and that the balance should be accounted for by the

plaintiffs in the profit and loss account. I agree with this submission. The plaintiffs

cannot, in the same breath, claim to be entitled to recover the expenses incurred for a

particular business transaction without also accounting for any profit made from that

transaction.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">105

        The transaction concerned pertained to a sale

of timber. The plaintiffs bought 8,000 cubic metres of timber from Vietnamese sellers at

US$97 per cubic metre (see Fung's second affidavit pages 198 to 199 and 206) and sold to

Haw Par:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1)    2,500 cubic

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    5,500 cubic

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The plaintiffs' bank debited the

plaintiffs' account with the sum of S$1,397,188 (US$776,000 converted to S$ at an exchange

Fung's second affidavit page 210). Haw Par in turn arranged for an irrevocable letter of

credit for US$835,000 to be opened in the plaintiffs' favour for the transaction (see

Fung's second affidavit pages 211 to 215).=</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">106

        The Vietnamese sellers unfortunately failed to

meet the shipping deadlines. In the meantime, Haw Par had arranged with Mitsubishi

Corporation for a vessel to proceed to Ho Chi Minh port in Vietnam to load the first

shipment of timber. When the cargo was not delivered on time, the charterer diverted the

vessel to pick up other cargo first. Mitsubishi Corporation made a claim against Haw Par,

who in turn made a claim against the plaintiffs. Haw Par sued the plaintiffs in the High

Court in Suit No. 860 of 1991 for breach of contract, and by consent, judgment was entered

for the sum which Haw Par had to pay Mitsubishi Corporation and costs. The total principal

and accrued interest which the plaintiffs paid Haw Par amounted to US$40,578.52 (which the

plaintiffs converted to S$70,160.26 at an exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7290) while the

costs paid amounted to S$700.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">107

        There was no evidence whether the timber sale

transaction was ultimately proceeded with or aborted. Mr Fung's affidavits were

conspicuously silent on this matter. Although the defendant expressly suggested in his

affidavit filed on 20 September 2000 that the plaintiffs should only be entitled to claim

the expenses referred to in items 192 and 193 of the Summary if the plaintiffs also

accounted for the profits from the timber transaction, Mr Fung failed to address this

point in his affidavit in reply filed on 11 October 2000. There is some basis for

believing that the timber sale transaction was subsequently proceeded with - in

particular, the letter from the Vietnamese seller at Fund's second affidavit page 221

contains an assurance that the seller would "DELIVER ... THE FULL QUANTITY

CONTRACTED".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">108

        If the timber transaction was subsequently

proceeded with without any hitches, the plaintiffs would have made a profit of

        As the plaintiffs have failed to provide

        <u>Item 20 - Transfer overpayment.</u> There

was a dispute between the parties as regards how my decision on item 20 of the Summary

would affect the profit and loss account. The short answer is that it does not affect the

profit and loss account at all. At paragraph 18 of my grounds of decision dated 30 May

2000, I explained that even if what the plaintiffs alleged was true, there was no

overpayment to the defendant, because there was no evidence that the goods shipped were of

a smaller quantity than the goods paid for by the plaintiffs. On the plaintiffs' own case,

what had happened was that the cost of freight exceeded the price differential between the

value of the goods and the amount that the plaintiffs paid for the goods, thus resulting

in an overall loss. I went on further to decide that the plaintiffs failed to prove that

there was an overpayment because:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1)    there was

    no documentary evidence to support the plaintiffs' allegation that they had paid

    $19,999.15 for freight; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    excluding

    freight, the plaintiffs expended a total of only $405,990.12 (inclusive of the $10,000

    cash handed to the defendant) but received goods valued at $417,467.01.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the circumstances, I fail to

see how my decision on item 20 of the Summary can have any effect on the profit and loss

account.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">112

        <u>Extraordinary expense in respect of rattan

alleged to have been paid for by the defendant and lost.</u> There was also a dispute

between the parties as regards how my decision on the rattan alleged to have been paid for

by the defendant and loss would affect the profit and loss account. The sum of US$26,000

had initially been expended by the defendant to acquire rattan for resale under the joint

venture. If the goods had not been "confiscated", the US$26,000 payment would

have been reflected under the "purchases" account, the proceeds from and

expenses incurred for the sale of the rattan would have been reflected in a trading

account, and any profit or loss from the trading account would have been transferred to

the profit and loss account. The "confiscation" of the rattan would result in a

total write-off of proceeds from this transaction. There should therefore be a

corresponding entry in the profit and loss account to reflect the total loss of US$26,000

incurred as a result of this transaction. At the present exchange rate of US$1 = S$1.7255,

this amounts to approximately S$44,863.</font></p>
