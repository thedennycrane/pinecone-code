The Plaintiff instructed Dr Tang Hang Wu, one of the co-authors of Tan, Tang and Low, <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Law Land </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law</span>”). Given the complexity of the issue and the Defendant’s failure to enter an appearance in these proceedings, I decided to appoint a young amicus curiae to assist the court. I am grateful to Ms Quek Ling Yi for agreeing to take up this appointment. I also invited the mortgagee of the Property, Malayan Banking Bhd, to make submissions, but they decided not to participate in these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 For reasons which I will elaborate on, I agree with Dr Tang that a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property is exigible to a WSS under the statutory framework applicable in Singapore. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Defendant is an Irish citizen while his wife is a Singapore citizen. The Property is a residential unit in a condominium development in Singapore, held by the Defendant and his wife as joint tenants. The Property is held subject to a charge by the Central Provident Fund Board, and a mortgage by Malayan Banking Bhd. The Defendant’s wife is not a party to these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiff was the law firm representing the Defendant in two High Court suits (“the Suits”), <span class="font-italic">vide</span>, HC/S 244 of 2013 (“Suit 244”) and HC/S 733 of 2014 (“Suit 733”). Judgment in the Suits was rendered on 26 September 2016 and reported as <span class="font-italic">Higgins, </span><span class="font-italic">Danial Patrick v Mulacek, Philippe Emanuel and others and another suit </span>[2016] 5 SLR 848 (“the Suit 733 Judgment”). On 24 October 2016, the Plaintiff ceased acting as the Defendant’s solicitors in the Suits. On 2 March 2017, the Plaintiff commenced the present proceedings against the Defendant for unpaid legal fees. On 9 June 2017, the Plaintiff obtained judgment in default of appearance against the Defendant for $394,254.14 plus interest and costs (“the Judgment Sum”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the meantime, the plaintiff in Suit 733 (“the Suit 733 Plaintiff”), upon discovering that the Defendant (who was the defendant in Suit 733) and his wife were attempting to sell the Property, applied for and obtained an order attaching the Defendant’s interest in the Property to satisfy the Suit 733 Judgment. The order was registered with the Registry of Titles pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)  on 19 April 2017. On the same day, the Suit 733 Plaintiff filed a WSS in respect of the Defendant’s interest in the Property pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(i). The foregoing took place during the period between <span class="font-italic">10 July 2015</span>, when the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching</span> held that a joint tenant’s interest in land was exigible to a WSS, and <span class="font-italic">10 July 2017</span>, when a different Judge of the High Court held to the contrary in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 When the sheriff served the WSS at the Property on 4 May 2017 pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii) of the ROC, the Property was found to be tenanted and neither the Defendant nor his wife was residing there. In letters written by the Defendant and his wife to the sheriff in June 2017, they claimed that they were both residing in Ireland. To date, the WSS obtained by the Suit 733 Plaintiff against the Defendant’s interest in the Property remains in force and no attempt has been made by the Defendant or his wife to set it aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 27 September 2017, the Plaintiff applied for an order attaching the Defendant’s interest in the Property to satisfy the Judgment Sum.

The Plaintiff appealed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether a judgment for the payment of money can be enforced by way of a WSS against the judgment debtor’s interest in immovable property which is held under a joint tenancy. I will examine this issue by first setting out a historical overview of the processes by which money judgments have been enforced against immovable property, followed by a survey of the positions in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, and then turning to consider what the legal position in Singapore is and ought to be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 For present purposes, the terms “immovable property” and “land” are used interchangeably as nothing turns on the distinction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Historical overview</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Execution of money judgment against land in medieval England</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In England, prior to the enactment of the Statute of Westminster II (13 Edward 1, c 24) (UK) (“Statute of Westminster II”) in 1285, execution of a money judgment could be levied against the land of a judgment debtor only through the writ of <span class="font-italic">levari</span><span class="font-italic"> facias</span>. This writ allowed the sheriff to receive the rents and profits derived from the judgment debtor’s land until the judgment debt was satisfied, but it did not allow the sheriff to seize possession of the land. (See William Blackstone, <span class="font-italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Vol 3 (A Strahan, 15th Ed, 1809) (“<span class="font-italic">Blackstone’s Commentaries</span><span class="font-italic"> (Vol 3)</span>”) at p 417). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In 1285, the Statute of Westminster II created the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>, under which a judgment creditor could take possession of <span class="font-italic">half</span> of the judgment debtor’s freehold land. Thereupon, the judgment creditor became a tenant by <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>of the land taken until judgment debt was paid off from the rents and profits derived from the relevant half of the land. The writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>, however,<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not allow the judgment creditor to sell the land to satisfy the judgment debt. (See <span class="font-italic">Blackstone’s Commentaries</span> <span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">Vol 3)</span> at pp 418–419; William Holdsworth, <span class="font-italic">A History of English Law</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Vol 3<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Methuen &amp; Co Ltd; Sweet and Maxwell, 5th Ed, 1942) (“<span class="font-italic">A History of English Law (</span><span class="font-italic">Vol 3)</span>”) at p 131). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Until this aspect of the law was changed in the mid-19th century, execution by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>was available against all freehold land belonging to the judgment debtor <span class="font-italic">as </span><span class="font-italic">at the date of the judgment</span>, even if the land had been sold by the judgment debtor after judgment. Thus, a money judgment, once issued, became a general lien or charge on the land of the judgment debtor.

This case concerned the execution of a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>on the interest of a joint tenant in land. The land in question was held by two sisters Margaret Pool and Frances Pool as joint tenants for life. Judgment was obtained by the plaintiff against Margaret in 1592. On 24 May 1595, Margaret released all her estate and right in the said land to Frances. As a result, Margaret ceased to be a joint tenant and Frances became the sole tenant for life of the land. On 27 June 1595, the plaintiff sought execution of the judgment by a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. It was held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When judgment is given against Margaret one of the joint-tenants for life, in an action of debt, and afterwards she releases to her joint-tenant before execution, although Frances to whom the release is made between them, is now <span class="font-italic">in</span> by the lessor, and not by the said Margaret, yet as to the plaintiff who has judgment in the action of debt (<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by which the moiety of Margaret was charged to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">his execution</span>) she by her own act shall not defeat the plaintiff of his execution, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as to him the estate of Margaret hath continuance in law</span>, although in truth Frances for the release made, had but an estate for her own life: but if Margaret had died before execution, the survivor should hold it discharged of any execution to be sued against her.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case</span> stood for the following propositions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A judgment gave rise to a lien or charge over a debtor-joint tenant’s interest in land (see the phrase “by which the moiety of Margaret was charged to the execution” in the judgment), in the same way that it would over any debtor-landowner’s interest in land (see [14] above for the reason for this lien or charge). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Just as this lien or charge could not be defeated by a debtor-landowner selling his land (see [14] above), it also could not be defeated by a debtor-joint tenant releasing his interest in the land to the other joint tenant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Therefore, even after such release, the judgment creditor would be entitled to proceed with execution by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>against the land as though the judgment debtor had remained a joint tenant of the land (see the phrase “but as to him the estate of Margaret hath continuance in law” in the judgment).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) However, there was an exception to the foregoing propositions – if the judgment debtor had died after the issuance of the judgment but before its execution, this would defeat the lien or charge and extinguish the judgment creditor’s right of execution against the judgment debtor’s interest as joint tenant in the land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Arising from these propositions, a few observations may be made:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The issue in <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s case</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was whether a judgment debtor could defeat execution against her interest as joint tenant by releasing her interest in the land to the other joint tenant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The premise underlying this issue must be that the law as it stood in 1595 allowed a joint tenant’s interest in land to be taken in execution of a judgment by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit. </span>Had this not been the case, the arguments in <span class="font-italic">Lord</span><span class="font-italic"> Abergavenny’s case </span>would have included the preliminary issue of whether a joint tenant’s interest in land was exigible to a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and not just the issue of whether an execution by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span> could be defeated by the joint tenant releasing her interest in the land before execution. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The same premise underlay the proposition outlined at [16(c)] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, notwithstanding the judgment debtor’s release of his interest, the plaintiff could proceed with execution as though the judgment debtor continued to be a joint tenant in the land. It would have served no purpose for the court to hold that the judgment creditor could proceed as though the judgment debtor remained a joint tenant in the land, if the law at that time did not allow a joint tenant’s interest in land to be reached by a writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The reference to “moiety” in the phrase “by which the moiety of Margaret was charged to the execution” does not sit comfortably with the oft-quoted maxim that each joint tenant holds the relevant estate together with the other joint tenants but holds nothing by himself. It would appear from the use of the word “moiety” that the court was either:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) looking ahead to the moiety of interest that would be created by a severance of the joint tenancy as a result of execution by writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) accepting that a joint tenant should be regarded as having an aliquot share (or potential aliquot<span class="font-italic"> </span>share)<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the purposes of execution of judgments, in the same way that he is regarded as having an aliquot<span class="font-italic"> </span>share (or potential aliquot<span class="font-italic"> </span>share)<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the purposes of alienation (as to which, see discussion at [70]-[88] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Twenty-one years later, in 1628, Sir Edward Coke published <span class="font-italic">The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England or a Commentary</span><span class="font-italic"> upon Littleton, not the Name of a Lawyer Only, but of the Law Itself </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Coke on Littleton</span>”), in which he wrote at p 184.b. in the chapter entitled “Of Joyntenants” that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if one joyntenant acknowledge a recognisance or a statute, or suffreth a judgment in an action of debt, &amp;c. and dieth before execution had, it shall not bee executed afterwards.

Section 367 of the CPO 1878 also provided that, when the writ of execution against lands was registered in a book kept at the courts called the “Executions against Lands Book” (pursuant to s 365 of the CPO 1878), the judgment creditor would have a charge on the judgment debtor’s interest in the land described in the writ. The court may direct the sheriff to sell the land so charged upon being satisfied that the parties before the court had good title to the land (see s 371 of the CPO 1878). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 These provisions represented a departure from the historical position outlined at [13]-[14] above in that, under the CPO 1878:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) execution was no longer limited to freehold land;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) execution could be effected against all of the judgment debtor’s land, instead of just half of his land;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a judgment would bind the judgment debtor’s land only after a writ of execution had been registered against the land; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) land taken in execution could be sold. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The effect of s 364 of the CPO 1878 was to broaden the categories of interests in land which were exigible to execution. There was no express exclusion of jointly owned lands from execution. There was also no discernible legislative intent to restrict the new writ to a narrower range of interests in land than those previously exigible to the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>.

This wording was wide enough to include the interest of a joint tenant in land. Since a joint tenant was entitled to alienate his aliquot share (or potential aliquot share) in land without the consent of the other joint tenant, his interest in this aliquot share would constitute “saleable property… belonging to the judgment debtor”, or “saleable property… over which… he has a disposing power”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The phrase “or any interest therein” in s 619(1) of the CPC 1907 had apparently been interpreted by Hyndman-Jones CJ in 1911 to include the interest of a tenant in common, <span class="font-italic">a joint tenant</span> or a co-parcener (see J Bernard Weiss, Bashir Mallal &amp; Nazir Mallal, <span class="font-italic">Straits Settlements Practice </span>(Malayan Law Journal Office, 1937) (“<span class="font-italic">Straits Settlements Practice</span>”) at p 296, citing an unreported written judgment issued by Hyndman-Jones CJ on 6 March 1911 in <span class="font-italic">Muthoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Karuppan Chitty v Onan &amp; ors., Onan, executor of Rejeedin deceased </span>(Suit No 688 of 1907) (“<span class="font-italic">Muthoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Karuppan Chitty</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Courts Ordinance 1934</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The CPC 1907 was repealed by Courts Ordinance 1934 (Ordinance No 17 of 1934) (“Courts Ordinance 1934”).

This would result in the cancellation of the registration referred to at [(c)] above (s 136 of the LTA).

The only known Singapore case pre-dating <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>which touched on this issue is <span class="font-italic">Muthoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Karuppan Chitty </span>(see [27(c)] above), and that case apparently considered the issue merely in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.<span class="font-italic"> Malayan Banking </span>may therefore be regarded as the first authoritative statement of the law on this issue by a superior court in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In holding that the interest of a joint tenant in land was <span class="font-italic">not</span> exigible to execution, the reasoning of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The “interest of the judgment debtor” attachable under a WSS under O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) must be a distinct and identifiable one (at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A WSS should seize only the judgment debtor’s interest and no more. Since each joint tenant has no distinct and identifiable share in the land, to seize one joint tenant’s interest under a WSS is to seize also the interest of the other joint tenant, <span class="font-italic">unless a WSS concomitantly severs the joint tenancy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [15]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, the registration of a WSS effects no such severance. While the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and another </span>[1987] SLR(R) 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu</span>”) recognised that the severance of a joint tenancy could be effected by an order of court, that decision had no application to a WSS because, unlike an order for the sale of property under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed), a WSS is not an order that must necessarily result in a sale – a WSS could lapse or be withdrawn without the property being sold (at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Further, given these contingencies, it would be “creating a fine mess” if the court were to hold that a WSS severs a joint tenancy upon registration. If the WSS were to lapse or be withdrawn, would the joint owners become joint tenants again? If the WSS was renewed or a further WSS issued, would the rights of the co-owners change once again? (at [18])</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There is also a conceptual difficulty with the notion that a WSS severs a joint tenancy and attaches to the share of the judgment debtor according to the number of joint tenants. The shares of joint tenants must be ascertained with regard to all the circumstances of the case. Once a joint tenancy is severed by a WSS, the joint tenants would be tempted to declare their relative shares in such a way as to minimise the share seized under the WSS and maximise the share retained by the “innocent” joint tenant (at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Apart from a WSS, a possible recourse which a judgment creditor may have against a joint tenant’s interest in land is to appoint a receiver by way of equitable execution (at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>attracted the attention of the learned Professor Tan Sook Yee, who authored the article <span class="font-italic">Execution against Co-Owne</span><span class="font-italic">d Property </span>[2000] Sing JLS 52 to express her disagreement with the conclusion reached in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>I do not propose to summarise Prof Tan’s reasons here separately as the reasons she canvassed will be touched on in the rest of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Despite Prof Tan’s article, <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>stood unchallenged until 2015, when the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>disagreed with <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Case law in Commonwealth jurisdictions appeared to support the view that the interest of a joint tenant in land was exigible to execution (at [15]–[16]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even though a joint tenant did not have an undivided share of the land, he had an interest in land which was identifiable and capable of being determined – the interest of a joint tenant could be converted into undivided shares by alienation (at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Since the interest of a joint tenant in land was capable of being identified and since it was commonly accepted that severance of a joint tenancy would occur when the sheriff sold the land, there was no reason why a WSS could not be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land (at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The challenge of having to particularise the exact interest of the judgment debtor was not insurmountable as the courts were capable of deciding this in the event of a dispute. In any event, the same concern would arise where a receiver is appointed in respect of a joint tenant’s interest in land (at [13]–[14]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) As for the concern expressed in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> about “creating a fine mess”, the relevant question to ask was not whether severance of the joint tenancy would occur when the WSS attached but whether severance could occur in the future. Since it was accepted that severance would occur when the sheriff sold the land (if it had not already occurred), there was no reason why a WSS could not be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land (at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Concerns about unfairness to the “innocent” co-owner may be overstated (at [21]–[23]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the judgment creditor could only take whatever the judgment debtor was entitled to and no more; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) even if the sheriff could obtain the court’s directions under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC to sell the entire property in spite of the “innocent” co-owner’s objections, this was not an outcome unique to joint tenancy situation – the same issue would arise in the context of execution against a tenant in common’s interest in land. The court should hesitate to treat judgment debtors differently based on the type of co-ownership by which their property was held; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the perceived “unfairness” to the “innocent” co-owner ought to be balanced against “unfairness” to the judgement creditor who could be left without a remedy if the WSS was not granted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Two years later, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>disagreed with <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>and decided to follow <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking. </span>Besides endorsing the reasons given in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, the court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>gave the following four additional reasons for disagreeing with <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) By focusing not on what was being seized when the WSS was issued but on what could be seized <span class="font-italic">subsequently </span>when the joint tenancy was severed, <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching</span> implicitly recognised that there was nothing for the WSS to bite onto until the joint tenancy was converted into a tenancy in common (at [32]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Before the court ordered the issuance of a WSS, it must be satisfied that the interest sought to be seized was capable of being seized. If the nature of the joint tenant’s interest was such that it cannot be seized under a WSS, it could not be an answer to say that the joint tenant’s interest would be converted into that of a tenant in common which can be seized under a WSS (at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching</span> appeared to be premised on an ability to sell the entire property after seizing only the debtor-joint tenant’s interest. But a seizure of the joint tenant’s interest is not the same as a seizure of the property itself. Therefore, it was not possible to sell the property<span class="font-italic"> </span>following the seizure of the debtor-joint tenant’s interest by WSS as the sheriff would not be able to do so without the agreement of all the joint tenants (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Commonwealth cases cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>proceeded on the assumption that a joint tenant’s interest in land was exigible to execution, without any discussion. These cases therefore did not assist in the analysis of the issue (at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 From the foregoing summary of <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking, Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien</span>, the relevant arguments and considerations in determining whether a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS may be grouped into the following six clusters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the nature of a joint tenancy means that a joint tenant’s interest is not exigible to a WSS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the court would be “creating a fine mess” by allowing the interest of a joint tenant to be taken in execution, given the implications arising from the time at which the joint tenancy would be severed during the WSS process;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the sheriff would be able to sell the land and, if not, whether this renders futile the issuance of a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether difficulties with ascertaining the relative shares of joint tenants in the land render the issuance of a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land impractical;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether allowing the interest of a joint tenant to be taken in execution results in unfairness to the “innocent” co-owner and how this should be balanced against possible “unfairness” to the judgment creditor; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) whether there are good reasons for Singapore to depart from what appears to be the uniform position in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations relating to the nature of joint tenancy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The key concern arising from the nature of the joint tenancy lies in the oft-cited proposition that all the joint tenants together own the whole property, but no one joint tenant holds any specific or distinct share of the property. This means that every joint tenant must partake in any dealings involving the <span class="font-italic">whole </span><span class="font-italic">property</span> before such dealings can effectively bind the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> property. Therefore, for instances, one joint tenant cannot sell the property without the agreement of all the joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 While the foregoing features of a joint tenancy are well established in law, I do not think they necessarily lead to the conclusion that a joint tenant’s interest is incapable of seizure by a WSS, or that a WSS issued against a joint tenant’s interest has nothing to bite onto. First, it is undeniable that a joint tenant has a real and present interest in the jointly owned property (as opposed to a future, contingent or speculative interest). Secondly, this interest of a joint tenant’s can be alienated without the consent or participation of the other joint tenant – when he does so, his very act of alienation severs the joint tenancy and crystallises his interest into an aliquot<span class="font-italic"> </span>share which can be sold independently of his co-tenant’s interest. Thirdly, it would appear logical that, whatever interest a judgment debtor is capable of selling on his own, the law of execution of judgments could empower the sheriff to sell it on the judgment debtor’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72  At first blush, the propositions at [71] above appear logically inconsistent with the propositions at [70] above. But scholars and jurists have long acknowledged the existence of this logical paradox <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the nature of the joint tenancy without being compelled to deny the correctness of either set of propositions. For example, in Barry C Crown, <span class="font-italic">Severance of Joint Tenancy of </span><span class="font-italic">Land by Partial Alienation </span>(2001) 117 LQR 477, the learned author remarked as follows (at p 478):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The fact that a joint tenancy can be severed by alienation presents considerable logical difficulties. Neither joint tenant owns a separate interest in the land. Each joint tenant holds everything yet holds nothing. If so, what property does he have to alienate to a third party? One might have thought, therefore, that the only way in which severance could take place would be by some form of agreement between all the joint tenants. In fact, however, severance is effected by the unilateral act of alienation by one of the joint tenants. What appears to happen is that the alienor disposes of an interest that he does not actually have and this “transfer” creates the very interest which was supposedly the subject-matter of the transfer in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The High Court of Australia has also had to confront this logical paradox squarely in <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons</span>. The case concerned three sisters who held certain lands as joint tenants. Two of the sisters executed an instrument under which they purported to transfer to each other their respective “one-third share” in the land. The question was whether this mutual transfer between two out of the three joint tenants had the effect of severing the joint tenancy such that all three sisters became tenants in common, even though the third sister had neither participated in the transfer nor agreed to the severance. The trial judge held that this mutual transfer did not sever the joint tenancy. On appeal to the High Court of Australia, Latham CJ, Rich J and Dixon J unanimously held that the joint tenancy had been severed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The trial judge’s reasoning was summarised by Dixon J at p 329 in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in contemplation of law joint tenants are jointly seised for the whole estate they take in land and no one of them has a distinct or separate title, interest or possession. It follows that an attempt on the part of two of three joint tenants mutually to assure each to the other his or her undivided share in the hope that each of their two shares will be taken by a new title and so enure as a several undivided interest, must fail because it can accomplish nothing. An alienation by a joint tenant of an undivided interest to a stranger, upon this view, imparts a several interest because such a power is incident to joint tenancy; but that is very different from identifying the respective interest of joint tenants and transposing them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The essence of the trial judge’s reasoning was that the joint tenants’ respective interests are not sufficiently identifiable to allow them to be transposed by way of such mutual assurance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In explaining the reasons for his disagreement with the trial judge, Dixon J examined the root of the logical paradox in the following passage at (pp 329–331):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A sentence in <span class="font-italic">Bracton</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">taken to be sure from its context</span>, has found its way through <span class="font-italic">Coke</span> into modern books as an expression of the conception: <span class="font-italic">Et sic </span><span class="font-italic">totum tenet et nihil tenet scilicet totum in communi </span>(or <span class="font-italic">conjunctim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as <span class="font-italic">Coke</span> has it) <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">nihil separatim per se.</span> Braction, fo. 430, Woodbine’s ed., vol. 4, p. 336; Co.

There it is said of joint tenants:– “Each of them has a right shared with his co-tenants to the whole common property, but no individual right to any undivided share in it … for this reason, joint tenants should not be spoken of as holding undivided shares.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Joshua Williams in his <span class="font-italic">Lectures on the </span><span class="font-italic">Seisin of the Freehold </span>(1878), p. 117, went as far as saying that joint tenants in fact were considered by the law as one person for most purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Logical as may seem the deduction that joint tenants have not interests which in contemplation of law are sufficiently distinct to assure mutually one to another, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">there are many considerations which show that, to say the least, the consequence cannot be called an unqualified truth</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. The fact is that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the principle upon which the deduction is based must itself be very much qualified</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">. It represents only one of two not altogether compatible aspects of joint tenancy</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a form of ownership bearing many traces of the scholasticism of the times in which its principles were developed. “Albeit they are so seised” says Coke, (186a) (“<span class="font-italic">scil</span><span class="font-italic">. totum conjunctim, et nihil per se separatim</span>”) “yet to divers purposes each of them hath by a right to a moitie.” <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">For the purposes of alienation each is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share</span>. The alienation may be partial. One joint tenant for an estate in fee simple may grant a lease of his equal share and during the lease the jointure is suspended and there is a temporary severance and apparently it would not matter that the lease did not commence until after the death of the joint tenant granting it. A joint tenant may grant an estate for life in his share, though in that case it seems that it works a severance of the entire fee simple. If one joint tenant suffered a forfeiture it was not the whole estate but only his aliquot<span class="font-italic"> </span>share that was forfeited. If one joint tenant proved to be an alien the Crown, on office found, took only his share. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Execution on a judgement for debt against one joint tenant bound his </span><span class="font-weight-bold">aliquot </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">share and continued to do so in the hands of the survivor if the execution debtor afterwards died</span>.

In <span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span>, a husband fraudulently procured the conveyance of certain lands from a company to him and his wife as joint tenants. There was no evidence that the wife had participated in or been aware of the husband’s fraud. A question arose as to whether the husband’s fraud could be imputed to the wife since, against the world, joint tenants were seen as one person. The majority in the High Court of Australia, comprising French CJ, Hayne J, Bell J and Gageler J declined to do so, reasoning (at [47]–[49]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Wright v </span><span class="font-italic">Gibbons</span>, Dixon J described joint tenancy as “a form of ownership bearing many traces of the scholasticism of the times in which its principles were developed”. And as his Honour’s discussion of the writers shows, the “pedantic, needlessly subtle” [<span class="font-italic">fn</span>: <span class="font-italic">The Oxford English Dictionary</span>, 2nd ed (1989), vol XIV at 630, “scholastic”, sense A4] thinking of that time was often compressed into maxims: especially “<span class="font-italic">nihil</span><span class="font-italic"> tenet et totum tenet</span>” (he holds nothing and he holds the whole) and “<span class="font-italic">per my et per tout</span>” (for nothing and for everything). But, as <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons </span>demonstrates, those maxims cannot and must not be treated as constituting a complete or wholly accurate description of the legal nature of a joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 The hinge about which the reasoning of Dixon J turned in <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons </span>was that <span class="font-italic">the maxims (and similar statements by later writers to the effect that joint tenants are “considered by law as one person for most purposes”) cannot be taken as the premise for deductive reasoning about the effect of a joint tenancy</span>. As Dixon J pointed out, by reference to <span class="font-italic">Coke on Littleton</span>, “[f]or purposes of alienation each [joint tenant] is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share”. That is because, as Dixon J also said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“Logical as may seem the deduction that joint tenants have not interests which in contemplation of law are sufficiently distinct to assure mutually one to another, there are many considerations which show that, <span class="font-italic">to say the least, </span>the consequence cannot be called an unqualified truth. <span class="font-italic">The fact is that the principle upon which the deduction is based must itself be very much qualified.</span>” (emphasis added) </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Only by recognising the necessity to qualify those statements of principle is it possible to account for the cases of forfeiture suffered by, and execution against, one of several joint tenants referred to by Dixon J</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 <span class="font-italic"> </span>Once qualifications of the principle that joint tenants are “considered by the law as one person for most purposes” are admitted to be necessary, bare statement of the principle cannot stand as a premise for deductive argument. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The foregoing passages from <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cassegrain</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are instructive.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As noted by Dixon J, there are “two <span class="font-italic">not altogether compatible</span> aspects of joint tenancy” [emphasis added]. Consequently, the court is not compelled to focus only on one aspect (that a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenant but holds nothing by himself) to the exclusion of the other equally valid aspect (that a joint tenant has a real ownership interest which is capable of immediate alienation without the consent of the other joint tenants). Once both aspects of joint tenancy are given weight to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it will no longer appear incompatible with the nature of the joint tenancy to hold that a joint tenant’s interest in land is exigible to a WSS; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the seizure of a joint tenant’s interest in land by WSS will also need not be seen as a seizure of the other joint tenant’s interest – while a WSS would prevent the debtor-joint tenant from dealing with his interest, with the consequence that the other joint tenant would not be able to join the debtor-joint tenant in disposing of the whole property together, the other joint tenant remains free to deal with his aliquot share independently of the debtor-joint tenant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The crucial role played by the second aspect of joint tenancy described at [77] above in the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in land to execution is illustrated by the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">The Registrar General of New South Wales v Wood </span>[1926] 39 CLR 46 (“<span class="font-italic">Registrar General v Wood</span>”), which is the authority cited in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Baalman’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Commentary </span>quoted at [35] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 <span class="font-italic">Registrar General v Wood </span>concerned a parcel of land held by a married couple on a form of co-ownership known as “tenancy by entireties”. This form of co-ownership “comprised an <span class="font-italic">unseverable</span> joint tenancy between husband and wife, supposedly symbolising the medieval theory of indivisible unity between marital partners” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Elements of Land Law </span>at para 7.4.110). In other words, tenancy by entireties is a form of co-ownership featuring only the first aspect of a joint tenancy (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the right of survivorship and the general rule that co-owners must act together when dealing with the property as a whole) but not the second aspect (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>severability of the joint tenancy and the rule that a joint tenant is able to act on his own share without the consent of the other joint tenant).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 After the wife’s interest in the land was seized under a writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri</span><span class="font-italic"> facias </span>to satisfy a judgment debt, the husband bought the wife’s interest in the land from the sheriff. When the husband sought to register the transfer, registration was refused by the Registrar General on the ground that the wife’s interest in the land could not be regarded as her separate property, and therefore could not be taken under the execution. Consequently, the sheriff’s sale could not and did not pass the wife’s interest to the husband.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The High Court of Australia held by a 3-2 majority that the Registrar General was wrong to have refused registration of the transfer. The disagreement between the majority and the dissenting judges turned on the extent to which the Married Women’s Property Act 1901 (NSW) (“MWPA”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>may be said to have transformed the wife’s interest under the tenancy by entireties into something more akin to a joint tenant’s interest. There was no disagreement among the judges that, had the MWPA<span class="font-italic"> </span>not been enacted and the issue were to be decided solely by reference to the characteristics of the tenancy by entireties at common law, the Registrar General would have been right to refuse registration of the transfer. Nor was there disagreement that if the MWPA<span class="font-italic"> </span>had indeed clothed the tenancy by entireties with the characteristics of a joint tenancy, the Registrar General would have been wrong to refuse registration of the transfer. The disagreement was thus over the impact of the MWPA<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the characteristics of the tenancy by entireties. The court’s <span class="font-italic">ratio </span>is succinctly encapsulated in the following passage from Rich J’s judgment (at pp 61–62):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The essential characteristic of the form of co-ownership called tenancy by entireties which distinguishes it from joint tenancy is that there can be no severance. “Neither can sever the jointure, but the whole must accrue to the survivor” (<span class="font-italic">Greed d. Crew v King </span>[(1788) 2. Bl. 1211, at p. 1213]). This arises from the fact that the spouses are together seised or possessed of a single estate or interest – “the husband and wife shall have no moieties” (<span class="font-italic">Co. </span><span class="font-italic">Litt</span>., sec. 291). No right of property is vested in each over the whole, but one right of property over the whole is vested in both.

The inability to sever a tenancy by entireties meant that the interest of a tenant by entireties at common law could not be taken in execution. If the tenancy by entireties became severable as a result of statutory intervention, the interest of a tenant by entireties naturally became exigible to execution. In other words, while the inability to sever a tenancy by entireties meant that a tenant by entireties’ interest at common law is not sufficiently distinct and identifiable to be seized in execution, the ability to sever would render such an interest sufficiently distinct and identifiable for it to be seized in execution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In coming to the foregoing view (see [77] above), I also considered two local decisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The first decision is the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Teh Lee v Lim Li Pheng Maria and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Teh Lee</span>”), in which the Court of Appeal described the nature of a joint tenancy as follows (at [11]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Joint tenancy is that form of co-ownership where each of the co-owners is entitled to the whole of the interest which is the subject of co-ownership.

Thus, no one joint tenant holds any specific or distinct share of the co-owned interest himself. Rather, the interest of each joint tenant is identical and lies in the whole and every part of the land, and none of that land is held by one joint tenant to the exclusion of the rest. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Although the foregoing statement focused only on the first aspect of the joint tenancy and did not discuss the second aspect, I do not think the Court of Appeal was thereby implying that Singapore law does not recognise the second aspect of the joint tenancy. The issue in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Teh Lee </span>was whether it was necessary under the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) for co-owners to act together if they wanted to either support or oppose a proposed collective sale of a strata development. In discussing this issue, the Court of Appeal was not concerned with the question of alienation or severance. Thus the occasion for the Court of Appeal to consider the second aspect of the joint tenancy simply did not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The second decision is <span class="font-italic">One Investment </span><span class="font-italic">and Consultancy Ltd and another v Cham Poh Meng (DBS Bank Ltd, garnishee) </span>[2016] 5 SLR 923 (“<span class="font-italic">One Investment</span>”), which was also raised by Ms Quek to this court’s attention. <span class="font-italic">One Investment </span>held that garnishee proceedings could not be brought against a bank account held in joint names<span class="font-italic">.</span> There are three key differences between <span class="font-italic">One Investment </span>and the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the overwhelming weight of Commonwealth authorities is <span class="font-italic">against</span> allowing execution on joint bank accounts by garnishee proceedings, while the overwhelming weight of Commonwealth authorities is <span class="font-italic">in favour</span> of allowing execution against the interest of a joint tenant in immovable property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the illiquid nature of immovable property compared to balances in a bank account means that many of the concerns surrounding the potential prejudice to the other joint account holders in garnishee proceedings do not arise in the context of execution against jointly owned lands; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) allowing joint bank accounts to be attached in garnishee proceedings would cause prejudice to banks who have no visibility as to the respective contributions of the joint account holders, while no similar prejudice would be caused to any third party if a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property was attached in execution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 More generally, a joint bank account is legally no more than a contractual debt owed by the bank to joint creditors, the existence and enforceability of which depends on the contractual relationship between the bank and them. Its nature is fundamentally different from tangible property such as land. I therefore do not consider <span class="font-italic">One Investment </span>to be applicable to the WSS context. By the same token, my decision should be confined to a joint tenant’s interest in land and has no application in the context of joint bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 For the foregoing reasons, I am not persuaded that the considerations arising from the nature of the joint tenancy are sufficient to support the conclusion that a joint tenant’s interest in land cannot be seized by WSS. On the contrary, the severability of the joint tenancy and the ability of a joint tenant to alienate his aliquot share (or potential aliquot share) without the consent of the other joint tenants ought, in principle, lead to the result that any property interest which a debtor-joint tenant is able to alienate on his own should be also saleable in execution by the sheriff on the debtor-joint tenant’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations arising from the timing of severance and possible undesirable consequences flowing therefrom</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 If a joint tenant’s interest could initially be seized by WSS and if the sheriff could subsequently sell the joint tenant’s interest so seized, this implies that severance must have occurred at some point between the time of seizure and the time of sale. Thus, a question may arise as to when exactly such severance occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In jurisdictions which employ the device of charging orders, the general position is that the making of a charging order absolute against the interest of a joint tenant in land severs the joint tenancy, although some uncertainty on this issue had arisen in Hong Kong as a result of the recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan </span>which departed from the established position by holding that a joint tenancy is not severed by a charging order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In Australia, the cases and textbooks agree that the taking of a joint tenant’s interest in execution severs the joint tenancy. However, it is not clear what exactly is meant by “taking in execution” in this context other than that mere registration of a judgment will not suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The position in Canada is represented by the decision in <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace</span>, which has been cited in both <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching</span> for the proposition that a joint tenancy is not severed by mere registration of the WSS. This case, however, warrants closer scrutiny. What <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace</span> actually decided was that under the law of Ontario severance occurred not when the writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri</span><span class="font-italic"> facias </span>was delivered to the sheriff, but only when the sheriff advertised the land for sale. However, with respect, I do not think that the lesson to be drawn by a Singapore court from <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>is that severance would occur only at the point of sale or advertisement for sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The issue in <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>concerned the time at which execution was deemed to have occurred under the statutory framework then prevailing in Ontario. In that case, the judgment debtor held certain lands on joint tenancy with her daughter. The judgment debtor passed away after the writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri</span><span class="font-italic"> facias </span>was delivered to the sheriff but before the sheriff could commence selling the lands. The question was whether the joint tenancy had been severed by the delivery of the writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri</span><span class="font-italic"> facias </span>to the sheriff, such that the judgment debtor’s share in the lands did not pass to her daughter by the right of survivorship. This would determine whether the judgment creditor could continue to execute against the judgment debtor’s interest in the lands after her death. Riddell JA reasoned (at p 794) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the first place, it has been undoubted law for centuries that where a writ under which an interest in land may be taken by the sheriff has been placed in his hands against a joint-tenant, and the joint-tenant dies before execution, the other joint-tenant surviving holds it discharged of the execution. <span class="font-italic">Lord Abergavenny’s Case</span> (1607) 6 Co. Rep. 78b, 77 E.R. 313 This law has never been doubted; and the sole question for decision is whether the delivery of the writ to the sheriff is “execution.” <span class="font-italic">The proposition that such is the case, is conclusively met by the language of the statute and rules</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That “delivery” of the writ to the sheriff is not the equivalent of “seizure” by him is plain from the Execution Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 112, s. 9(3) in the case of goods and s. 8 in the case of lands – it would savour of absurdity to say that a sheriff “to whom a writ of execution against lands is delivered for execution may seize and sell thereunder” if the delivery itself was equivalent to seizure. But still stronger, if possible, is the effect of our R. 564, corresponding to former statutory provisions; the Rule says that, “The advertisement in the <span class="font-italic">Ontario Gazette </span>of any lands for sale under a writ of <span class="font-italic">fieri</span><span class="font-italic"> facias</span>, during the currency of the writ, shall be deemed a sufficient commencement of the execution …” This would be nonsense if the delivery of the writ to the sheriff, itself, was <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, the commencement of the execution. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Therefore, <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>does not stand for the general proposition that, independent of the statutory context, severance under a writ of execution occurs only when the sheriff commences the process of selling the land. Instead, <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>stands for the following, narrower propositions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Since s 8 of the Execution Act 1927 of Ontario (c 112) provided that a sheriff “to whom a writ of execution against lands is delivered for execution may seize and sell thereunder”, it would be absurd to say that mere delivery “for execution” itself constituted execution or seizure. Therefore, delivery of the writ to the sheriff would not have had the effect of severing the joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Since it was provided in R. 564 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Supreme Court of Ontario (in Civil Matters) 1913 that an advertisement for sale shall be deemed sufficient commencement of the execution, severance of the joint tenancy would occur at the time of such advertisement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the light of the foregoing, the lesson to be drawn from <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is that, in order to identify the time of severance, we need to understand what constitutes execution or seizure under Singapore’s statutory framework. In my view, the answer lies in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “seizure shall be effected by registering” the WSS; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) upon registration, the interest of the judgment debtor in the land “shall be deemed to be seized by the Sheriff”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 This conclusion is fortified by the observation that Forms 83 and 97 of the ROC were drafted on the basis that the interest of the judgment debtor had been seized upon registration of the WSS pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Form 83 of the ROC, which is the writ directed to the sheriff <span class="font-italic">after </span>the WSS had been registered pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), begins with the phrase: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having seized the interest of (name of execution debtor) in the immovable property specified in the Schedule hereto pursuant to the Order of Court dated … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">while Form 97 of the ROC, which is the notice of seizure to be served on the judgment debtor, begins with:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Take notice that on … (date of registration under O. 47, r. 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) the interest of (name of judgment debtor) in the immovable property specified in the Schedule hereto has been seized… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Therefore, if the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Power v Grace </span>is to be followed, the proposition derived should be that severance would occur under the Singapore statutory framework at the time the WSS is registered. This is also the position urged upon this court by Dr Tang and Ms Quek, with which I agree. Despite differences between jurisdictions over when execution is deemed to have occurred and a lack of clarity in some jurisdictions over when execution is deemed to have occurred, the notion that severance occurs upon execution appears well accepted among Commonwealth jurisdictions. I am therefore prepared to hold that, in Singapore, severance of a joint tenancy occurs when the debtor-joint tenant’s interest is seized and this seizure occurs when the WSS is registered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I turn now to another related concern raised in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>It was said in that case that a WSS could not attach the interest of a joint tenant unless it concomitantly severed the joint tenancy, but if the WSS were to sever the joint tenancy upon registration, the following undesirable consequences would ensue (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Bearing in mind that any of the above contingencies could happen, it would be creating a fine mess to hold that a WSS when registered severs a joint tenancy. What would be the position of the co-owners in relation to each other should the WSS subsequently be withdrawn or its registration lapse? Do they revert to being joint tenants again? If the WSS is renewed or a second or subsequent one issued, do the rights of the co-owners change once again? …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 <span class="font-italic"> </span>Dr Tang submitted that this concern over “creating a fine mess” could be addressed by the doctrine of “temporary severance”. In brief, this doctrine involved the following tenets:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the registration of a WSS does not permanently sever the joint tenancy;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) instead, a temporary severance is effected while the WSS remains in force, during which period the four unities of a joint tenancy are suspended;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if the WSS lapses or is withdrawn, the four unities are restored and the joint tenancy comes back into existence; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) permanent severance occurs only upon an out-and-out sale of the joint tenant’s interest by the sheriff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 To illustrate the doctrine of temporary severance, Dr Tang referred to the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Wright v Gibbons</span> (at pp 328–329):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For purposes of alienation each [joint tenant] is conceived as entitled to dispose of an aliquot share. The alienation may be partial. One joint tenant for an estate in fee simple may grant a lease of his equal share and during the lease the jointure is suspended and there is a temporary severance …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">and the following passage from the Supreme Court of Victoria in <span class="font-italic">Frieze v Unger </span>[1960] VR 230:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But a demise for a term of years by one of two joint tenants in fee does not, according to the preferable view, work a severance of the whole fee; at most it effects a “severance for the time”, or “suspends” the joint tenancy <span class="font-italic">pro tem</span>. This is the view of Dixon J, loc. cit.; and see Co. Litt. 185a, 318a, and <span class="font-italic">Megar</span><span class="font-italic">ry and Wade</span>, loc. cit., note 23, commenting on Coke’s doctrine. It is not altogether apparent what is meant by a temporary severance or suspension; but at all events, it is clear that the doctrine involves the proposition that the reversion expectant on the term will pass to the survivor of the joint tenants, so that any “severance” or “suspension” is such only as it necessary to procure for the lessee the enjoyment during the term of the grantor’s moiety both after as well as before the grantor’s death; cf. Co. Litt., 186a; and <span class="font-italic">Rolle’s Abr</span>., 1668, vol 2, p 89, in a note on <span class="font-italic">Smallman</span><span class="font-italic"> v Agborow </span>(1617) Cro Jac 417; 79 ER 356. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As a demonstration of the utility and appropriateness of adopting the doctrine of temporary severance in the context of execution of judgments, Dr Tang suggested that the doctrine would allow the Hong Kong case of <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan</span> to be reconciled with earlier Hong Kong cases which consistently held that a charging order absolute made against the interest of a joint tenant in land severed the joint tenancy. In <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan</span>, a bank obtained a charging order absolute against the debtor-joint tenant’s interest in land in 1994. The charging order was discharged in 1995. The debtor-joint tenant died in 1998. The surviving joint tenant sold all her interest in the property in 2005. The question was whether the purchaser obtained good title to the entire property (assuming the joint tenancy had not been severed and the debtor’s share had gone to the surviving joint tenant) or to only 50% of the property (assuming the joint tenancy had been severed by the charging order and that the debtor’s share had gone to his estate). In holding that the charging order did not sever the joint tenancy, <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan </span>departed from what was thought to be the settled position in earlier Hong Kong cases. Although the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan </span>did not expressly rely on the doctrine of temporary severance, Dr Tang suggested that if <span class="font-italic">Ho</span><span class="font-italic"> Wai Kwan </span>was seen in the light of this doctrine, it would allow the Hong Kong cases to be reconciled with each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 After hearing Dr Tang, Ms Quek also agreed that the Singapore courts could adopt the doctrine of temporary severance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my view, there is some attraction to adopting the doctrine of temporary severance in Singapore in the context of execution of judgments. It is true that the passages quoted at [100] above suggest that the doctrine has arisen only in cases involving leases that were unilaterally created by one joint tenant without the participation of the other joint tenant. It is also true that the doctrine does not offer a panacea for all the practical difficulties that may arise in relation to an execution by WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land. Indeed, the doctrine may give rise to further concerns. For instance, if the joint tenancy could be suspended upon registration of the WSS and could come back into existence upon the lapse or withdrawal of the WSS, large fortunes could change hands as a result of fortuitous events such as whether a joint tenant passes away before or after the lapse or withdrawal of the WSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Having said that, there appears on balance to be good arguments for the adoption of the doctrine. First, it offers a workable manner of addressing the concern over “creating a fine mess” identified in <span class="font-italic">Malayan </span><span class="font-italic">Banking vis-à-vis</span> a lapsed or withdrawn WSS. Secondly, keeping the severance temporary and allowing the interests of the co-owner to be restored into a joint tenancy upon the lapse or withdrawal of a WSS would better accord with the co-owners’ original intention for holding the land on joint tenancy, since it is generally unlikely that the joint tenants’ original preference for holding the land on joint tenancy would have changed simply because a WSS had been issued in respect of the land. Thirdly, as with any other area of law, practical difficulties can be clarified and ironed out through the incremental development of case law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In light of the above, although there is no need to decide conclusively on the adoption of the doctrine of temporary severance for present purposes, I am persuaded that the “fine mess” concern raised in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>, while valid, is not insurmountable and should not in itself preclude the exigibility of a joint tenant’s interest in land to a WSS in execution of a judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Concerns over the sheriff’s ability to sell and whether the WSS is futile</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The utility of the WSS when attached to a debtor-joint tenant’s interest in land should be considered in two separate respects: (a) the saleability of the joint tenant’s interest in the land, and (b) the saleability of the whole property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>it was suggested at [21]–[22] that even though a WSS would effect a seizure of the debtor-joint tenant’s interest and nothing more, the sheriff could still apply to court for directions under O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC for the sale of the whole property in spite of the objections of the “innocent” joint tenant. It is not clear why the court in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>saw the need to make such a suggestion. Perhaps the suggestion arose out of an apprehension that a WSS which seizes only the debtor-joint tenant’s interest is of limited utility unless the sheriff is empowered to sell also the interest of the “innocent” joint tenant. Indeed Dr Tang also candidly recognised the difficulties with marketability of a joint tenant’s interest in land when he cited the following authorities:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Elements of Land Law </span>which remarked (at fn 7 of para. 6.1.32) that “[a] sale of merely the debtor’s beneficial share is impractical”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Walker v Lundborg</span> (see [53(c)] above) in which Lord Walker, delivering the opinion of the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Bahamas, remarked at [49] that “[a]n undivided share of a residential property is not a marketable asset”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 <span class="font-italic">Walker v Lundborg </span>held at [49] that Order 31 of the Bahamas Rules of Supreme Court (c 53) (LRO 1/2006), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with O 31 of our ROC, enabled the court to authorise the sale of a jointly owned property as a whole on the application of a judgement creditor who had obtained judgment against only one joint tenant. <span class="font-italic">Midland Bank Ltd v Pike </span>[1988] 2 All ER 434 (“<span class="font-italic">Pike</span>”) was cited in <span class="font-italic">Walker v </span><span class="font-italic">Lundborg </span>as an authority for this proposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In my view, when evaluating the relevance of <span class="font-italic">Walker v </span><span class="font-italic">Lundborg </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pike </span>to Singapore, it is important to have regard to the following points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 63 of the Bahamas Supreme Court Act (c 53) (LRO 1/2010), a judgment operated as an equitable charge on all of the judgment debtor’s lands from the moment the judgment is entered (see <span class="font-italic">Walker v </span><span class="font-italic">Lundborg </span>at [8]). Specifically, s 63(2) provided that such a charge may be enforced “in the same manner as an equitable charge created by the debtor by writing under his hand”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In England, it is expressly and similarly provided in s 3(4) of the Charging Orders Act 1979 (c 53) that a charge imposed by a charging order may be enforced “in the same manner as an equitable charge created by the debtor by writing under this hand”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The nature and effect of a WSS against lands in Singapore is different from that of a judgment-charge in Bahamas or a charging order in England. Nothing in O 47 rr 4 and 5 of the ROC or ss 131–136 of the LTA provides that the WSS operates as a charge on the land seized under the WSS. Given this important difference between Singapore’s statutory framework and the statutory framework in those jurisdictions which employ the devices of a judgment-charge or a charging order, the question whether the sheriff may sell the property as a whole under a WSS in Singapore must be answered by reference to the statutory provisions applicable in Singapore and not by reference to case law from these other jurisdictions. The relevant Singapore statutory provisions are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) s 135(1) of the LTA, which provides that the interest in registered land that may be sold in execution under a writ “shall be the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of the registration of the writ”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) O 47 r 5 of the ROC, which in para (e) refers specifically to the sale of the interest of the judgment debtor in any immovable property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Form 83 of the ROC, which directs the sheriff to “sell the said interest” to satisfy the judgment debt. The phrase “said interest” refers to the interest of the judgment debtor named in the WSS; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Form 97 of the ROC, which gives notice to the judgment debtor that if the judgment debt is not satisfied “the same will be sold by public auction after the expiry of 30 days from the day of seizure”. The phrase “the same” refers to the interest of the judgment debtor named in the WSS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In the absence of any statutory provisions in Singapore to the effect that a WSS against land operates as an equitable charge on the land, it appears that there is no basis for supposing that the sheriff may apply to court for directions under O 47 r 5(g) of the ROC for the sale of the whole property in spite of the objections of the “innocent” joint tenant. However, as this issue does not arise squarely before me, I do not come to a conclusive view on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Having said that, even if the sheriff cannot sell the property as a whole and can only deal in the debtor-joint tenant’s aliquot share, the assumption that there would be limited utility for a WSS to be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land (see [107] above) may not hold true.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The starting premise of the analysis is s 135 of the LTA, which provides that the sheriff may sell “the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor at the date of the registration of the writ”. In the case of a debtor-joint tenant, that interest would be the interest of the joint tenant in land which, as we have seen from the discussion at [72]-[77] above, comprises two aspects: for the purposes of tenure and survivorship, a joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but holds nothing on his own, but for the purposes of immediate alienation, each joint tenant is entitled to dispose of an aliquot share. In the context of a writ of seizure and <span class="font-italic">sale</span>, the relevant aspect of a joint tenant’s interest in land would be that concerning immediate alienation – the aliquot share which the joint tenant is entitled to unilaterally dispose of. Given that the sheriff is statutorily empowered to act as a registered proprietor to effect a sale under a WSS (see [63] above), the sheriff would (assuming a WSS can be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land) be able to sell the debtor-joint tenant’s aliquot share just as the debtor-joint tenant would be able to do so himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In this regard, while an undivided share in immovable property is difficult to market to third parties and not likely to fetch a good price, that does not mean that the ability to sell an undivided share is not without value or utility. Indeed, even if a WSS does not allow the sheriff to sell the land as a whole, it confers a real benefit to the judgment creditor in at least two ways: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It prevents dealings in the land by the other “innocent” joint tenant. This may create enough of a nuisance for the “innocent” joint tenant to:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) settle the debtor-joint tenant’s judgment debt so as to get the WSS lifted;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) buy over the debtor-joint tenant’s share from the sheriff (see the facts of <span class="font-italic">Registrar General v Wood </span>discussed at [80] above); or </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) consent to the sale of the whole property by the sheriff in order that the “innocent” joint tenant may unlock the full economic value of his own aliquot share. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As purchases of immovable properties in Singapore are generally financed by mortgage loans, a sale under a WSS is not possible without the mortgagees’ consent. In such a situation, the value of a WSS lies not in the judgment creditor’s ability to trigger a sale by the sheriff but in the priority which the WSS affords the judgment creditor in the distribution of any residual proceeds from a mortgagee’s sale. In fact, the dispute in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> arose out of competing claims by execution creditors over the residual proceeds from a mortgagee’s sale. This advantage concerning priority would also apply in the event that an individual judgment debtor is declared bankrupt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 For these reasons, I recognise that a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land confers real, and not merely illusory, value to a judgment creditor. Whether the economics of litigation in each case warrant the judgement creditor taking the step of seeking such a WSS is a matter for the individual plaintiff and judgment creditor to consider. However, even assuming that there is no power for the court to order a sale of the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> property, it is not necessary to conclude that the court would act in futility by allowing a WSS to attach against a joint tenant’s interest in land. There are other ways in which the WSS may benefit the judgment creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Finally, I note that the same concerns with the marketability of a partial interest in land would apply with equal force to the sale of a tenant in common’s undivided share in a tenancy in common, which sale is not controversial. Accordingly, the limited marketability of an interest should not in itself be a reason for disallowing execution against the joint tenant’s interest in land. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Concerns over difficulties with ascertaining the relative shares of joint tenants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I accept that once a joint tenancy is severed by the registration of the WSS, the joint tenants would be tempted to argue that they were holding their interest in unequal shares in equity and that that smaller share belonged to the debtor-joint tenant. In this regard, Ms Quek noted that the Commonwealth authorities which permitted execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land did not regard the issue of apportionment as an insurmountable issue, but rather took the default position that, unless otherwise established, the joint tenants hold in equal shares in tenancy in common upon severance. I agree that this is a sensible approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court, sheriff and judgment creditor should be entitled to proceed on the basis that the joint tenants would, upon severance of their joint tenancy, hold the land in equal share both at law and in equity. It is a logical consequence of the notion that each joint tenant holds the whole with the other joint tenants but holds nothing by himself that all joint tenants should be regarded as having equal rights and equal status. Consequently, in the absence of contrary indication, each joint tenant should be entitled to an equal share upon severance. So long as a mechanism exists for interested joint tenants prove that their beneficial interests are not held in equal share, no injustice would be caused to any joint tenant. This mechanism exists today because our rules of procedure allow the other joint tenant to either intervene in the suit under which the WSS was issued or commence separate proceedings to assert his right over the land. Alternatively, it is open to the sheriff to bring the matter to court pursuant to O 47 r 5(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the ROC and seek the court’s procedural directions on how any dispute over apportionment of shares should be dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The spectre of such satellite litigation is one complication with allowing execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land which is not present in executions against a tenant in common’s interest because, in a tenancy in common the respective shares of the co-owners would have been made clear from the outset. In my view, however, while this may be a relevant policy consideration against allowing execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land, it must ultimately be weighed against the authorities supporting the contrary and other relevant considerations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations arising from possible “unfairness” to the other joint tenant vs possible “unfairness” to judgment creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 A concern was expressed in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>that if the position in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span> prevailed, debtors may be able to put their immovable properties out of the reach of creditors by holding them on joint tenancy. This view was shared by Ms Quek, who added that the unfairness is exacerbated by the significant rise in property prices in Singapore during the two decades since the decision in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I accept that this may not be a wholly compelling concern. Even if execution by WSS was not allowed, the process of bankruptcy remained available to the creditors, and indeed, as Dr Tang accepted, the joint tenancy would be severed if the debtor went into bankruptcy, and his share of the property would thereafter be vested in the Official Assignee. At that stage, the debtor-joint tenant’s aliquot share would be available for distribution to creditors upon realisation by the Official Assignee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 However, reliance on the mechanism of a bankruptcy is not uncontroversial. Both Dr Tang and Ms Quek suggested that it would be unfair and disadvantageous to require judgment creditors to enforce their judgments against a joint tenant’s interest in immovable property by way of bankruptcy proceedings instead of by a WSS, as the judgment creditors would then have to share the realised assets of the bankrupt debtor <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>with other unsecured creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I see some force in this argument of “unfairness” as I accept that judgment creditors are, and should be, generally placed in a more advantageous position than other unsecured creditors insofar as judgment creditors are entitled to levy execution against the judgment debtors’ properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 However, it takes a leap of logic to conclude from there that the law would be treating judgment creditors unfairly simply because it ring-fences some categories of property from execution. On the contrary, there is some attractiveness to the idea that the realisation of jointly owned properties to satisfy debts should be postponed until all other assets of the debtor are exhausted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In particular, the right of survivorship that distinguishes joint tenancies from tenancies in common means that co-owners would generally not choose to hold as joint tenants unless there is some sort of familial or analogous relationship. In many cases, these jointly-held properties are likely to be the family residences of the debtors. In response, Dr Tang submitted that the concern with family residences is not pressing in Singapore as more than 80% of our population stay in public housing which, pursuant to s 51(6) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed), are immune from judgment execution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On balance, I do not think these arguments on purported “unfairness” bring us very far. I therefore do not see these considerations as providing strong arguments either for or against making a WSS available against a joint tenant’s interest in land.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations on harmonising local jurisprudence with that of other Commonwealth jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Dr Tang pointed to the overwhelming weight of Commonwealth authorities in favour of allowing a joint tenant’s interest in land to be taken in execution and submitted that Singapore should follow the general position in these other jurisdictions. Ms Quek submitted that there was no compelling reason for not aligning ourselves with the other Commonwealth jurisdictions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I agree that it is generally desirable for common law jurisdictions to learn from each other and for courts to lean in favour of harmonising the development of common law around the world, particularly on issues where other jurisdictions appear to speak with one voice. I also note that the discussions concerning Commonwealth authorities in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien </span>were rather tentative, presumably because counsel in those cases did not expound on these authorities in as detailed and exhaustive a manner as Dr Tang had done. Having been taken through the Commonwealth cases discussed at [37]- [54] by Dr Tang, I am persuaded that the position taken by these Commonwealth jurisdictions accord with logic and principle. I could not find any local circumstances (not even the scarcity of land and high property prices in Singapore) to persuade me that this an issue on which Singapore should strike out on its own and take a different position from all of the other Commonwealth jurisdictions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Considerations arising from the scope of Section 13 of the SCJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Dr Tang also submitted on s 13 of the SCJA, which history I have set out above (see [31] above). The proper construction of this provision was not a point considered in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking, Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>or <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien</span>. Section 13 of the SCJA provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Writs of execution</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13.  A judgment of the High Court for the payment of money to any person or into court may be enforced by a writ, to be called a writ of seizure and sale, under which all the property, movable or immovable, of whatever description, of a judgment debtor may be seized, except — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the wearing apparel and bedding of the judgment debtor or his family, and the tools and implements of his trade, when the value of such apparel, bedding, tools and implements does not exceed $1,000;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) tools of artisans, and, where the judgment debtor is an agriculturist, his implements of husbandry and such animals and seed-grain or produce as may in the opinion of the court be necessary to enable him to earn his livelihood as such;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the wages or salary of the judgment debtor;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) any pension, gratuity or allowance granted by the Government; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) the share of the judgment debtor in a partnership, as to which the judgment creditor is entitled to proceed to obtain a charge under any provision of any written law relating to partnership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Dr Tang noted that s 13 of the SCJA contemplated the exigibility of “all the property, movable or immovable, of whatever description”, and did not specifically exempt jointly owned properties. He argued that it was therefore clear that interests in immovable properties held under a joint tenancy would fall within the ambit of s 13 of the SCJA. I agree with him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 However, <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>turned on the interpretation of the phrase “interest of the judgment debtor” in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC. Through a series of logical steps, beginning with the interpretation of the phrase “interest of the judgment debtor” as requiring a distinct and identifiable interest that a WSS could bite onto, to holding that the registration of a WSS does not sever a joint tenancy, <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>concluded that the phrase “interest of the judgment debtor” does not include the interest of a joint tenant in land. The question, therefore, is to what extent should the interpretation of O 47 r 4 be influenced by the existence and wording of s 13 of the SCJA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In this regard, the decisions in <span class="font-italic">American Express Bank Ltd v Abdul </span><span class="font-italic">Manaff bin Ahmand and another and two other appeals </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 780 (at [27]) and <span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Straitsworld Advisory Ltd and another </span>[2017] SGHCR 11 (at [13]–[14] and [30]–[31]) suggest that, because the ROC provides for different modes of execution, there is no requirement to interpret any particular provision on execution in the ROC as coinciding in scope with the full ambit of s 13 of the SCJA. Thus, since a garnishee order is suitable only for attaching debts, it would not be inconsistent with<span class="font-italic"> </span>s 13 of the SCJA to interpret the ROC provisions on garnishee orders as not applying to tangible property, even though tangible property is within the scope of s 13 itself. Similarly, since a WSS for immovable property is suitable only for attaching immovable property, it would not be inconsistent with s 13 to interpret the ROC provisions on a WSS for immovable property as not applying to chattels, even though chattels fall within the scope of s 13 of the SCJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 This much is uncontroversial, but it begs the further question whether, if the ROC provides for only one mode of execution against interest in immovable property, there is an expectation that the relevant provision should, in the absence of express indication to the contrary, cover all types of interests in immovable property coming within the ambit of s 13 of the SCJA. In my view, this is likely to be the case. Given that the provisions in the ROC on execution by WSS against immovable property employ broad and general phrases such as “immovable property or any interest therein” or “interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property” without qualification, the most reasonable interpretation is that they are intended to cover all possible interests in immovable property which come within the ambit of s 13 SCJA. This would include the interest of a joint tenant in land.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Approach towards conflicting decisions of the High Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In his submissions, Dr Tang cited <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Shadrake Alan </span>[2011] 2 SLR 445 (“<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4] for the proposition that horizontal <span class="font-italic">stare </span><span class="font-italic">decisis </span>does not prevail in Singapore and that, consequently, I am not bound by <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>. Insofar as that proposition is concerned, I agree. However, the court in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>also went on to state (at [5]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I must bear in mind that the decisions of my learned colleagues and predecessors over the past four decades are entitled to the very greatest respect and unless there are compelling reasons to do so, I should not depart from them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 This consideration would clearly apply if there had been a consistent line of local High Court decisions holding that a joint tenant’s interest in land is <span class="font-italic">not </span>exigible to a WSS. Indeed, I believe it would also apply if <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>had been the only local High Court decision on this point. This is because where there is a longstanding decision on a point of law, it is likely that individuals and businesses would have organised their affairs on the understanding that this decision represented the law and in the expectation that, since the decision had not been challenged for many years, it is likely to continue representing the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 That is, however, not the situation we are faced with in the present case. The High Court, especially in recent years, has given conflicting indications as to the issue that was first discussed in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking</span>. In such a situation, as was the case confronting the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>, it would be a fair characterisation to say that there is no settled approach and that it is not possible to say which earlier decision should be followed as a matter of consistency between High Court decisions. In my view, following the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [43]), the better and perhaps necessary course is to return to first principles and policy considerations in determining how the court should proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 There was one final point which troubled me. This concerns the long gap of 17 years between the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwe Ching </span>and the possibility that a significant number of persons may have organised their affairs during this 17-year gap with the expectation that a joint tenant’s interest in land cannot be reached by creditors by execution<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>In the end, however, I decided that this is not a sufficiently compelling concern because, even during this 17-year gap, it has always been understood that a joint tenant’s interest in land will vest in the Official Assignee on the bankruptcy of the joint tenant, which would in turn result in severance of the joint tenancy. In the circumstances, no debtor can claim a legitimate expectation that his interest as a joint tenant in land is protected absolutely from his creditors. The decision to allow a WSS to be issued against a joint tenant’s interest in land merely shifts the timing of when that interest may be reached by the creditors; it does not affect the substantive position of whether that interest can ultimately be reached by these same creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Prior to 1826, English law allowed execution against the interest of a joint tenant in land by way of the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit</span>. This became part of Singapore law with the issuance of the Second Charter of Justice. This position under Singapore’s common law was unaffected by subsequent statutory developments, from the replacement of the writ of <span class="font-italic">elegit </span>with the writ of execution against lands in 1878, to the replacement of the writ of execution against lands with the WSS in 1907, to the replacement of the WSS with the charging order in 1970, and finally to the reinstatement of the WSS once again in 1991. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Nor was the position affected by the introduction of the Torrens system of land registration in Singapore. In fact, the Torrens system was adapted by Singapore from Australia with the specific knowledge that the interest of a joint tenant in land was exigible to execution under Australian law and that the introduction of Torrens legislation would not affect the law on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 It is all the more unquestionable that the foregoing represents an accurate description of Singapore common law, since the same position has been received and maintained by all the Commonwealth jurisdictions on which relevant materials could be found. In this regard, allowing execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land will bring our law in line with that of other Commonwealth jurisdictions, which in my view would be a desirable development since there appears to be no compelling local circumstances which warrant a different path to be taken on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 As a matter of principle, I have no difficulties with the notion that the phrase “interest of the judgment debtor” in O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC refers to an interest which is sufficiently distinct and identifiable to be seized in a meaningful way. In my view, a joint tenant’s interest in land amply satisfies this requirement. As the discussion at [78]–[82] above demonstrates, unlike a tenancy by entireties which cannot be severed, a joint tenancy is severable. This severability of the joint tenancy is that which renders the interest of a joint tenant sufficiently distinct and identifiable to be seized by a WSS in a meaningful way. The seizure, which is effected at the time of registration of the WSS, will effect a severance of the joint tenancy which in turn enables the sheriff to sell the joint tenant’s interest. The fact that a joint tenant’s interest in land is of limited marketability does not constitute sufficient reason to disallow execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land. As discussed at [114] above, despite this limited marketability, the ability to execute against a joint tenant’s interest in land remains of real value to judgment creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I appreciate that allowing execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land may lead to some initial uncertainty and perhaps an initial increase in litigation over issues such as the timing of severance and whether such severance is temporary or permanent. However, in my view, as with any other area of law, the uncertainties and difficulties can be clarified and ironed out through the incremental development of case law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Finally, I also appreciate that allowing execution against the interest of a joint tenant in land may give rise to satellite litigation over the relative shares which each joint tenant is entitled to after the joint tenancy is severed by registration of the WSS. While the possible risks and possible costs arising from such satellite litigation is something which a judgment creditor would take into account before deciding whether to issue a WSS against a joint tenant’s interest in land, I do not think the prospect of satellite litigation is sufficient to outweigh the other factors discussed in this judgment in favour of allowing execution against a joint tenant’s interest in land.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For the reasons I have given above, I hold that a WSS may be issued under O 47 r 4 of the ROC against the interest of a joint tenant’s in land. I also hold that, when a WSS is issued against a joint tenant’s in land, the joint tenancy is severed when the WSS is registered pursuant to O 47 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC. While I find the doctrine of temporary severance proffered by Dr Tang to be both sensible and attractive, I make no pronouncement on the point and would leave this to be further explored in a future case. On the issue of whether the sheriff can sell the entire property (as opposed to merely the debtor-joint tenant’s interest) without the consent of the other joint tenant, I tend to agree with <span class="font-italic">Chan Lung </span><span class="font-italic">Kien</span> that this cannot be done, but I decline to make a definitive ruling on this point as the issue did not arise on the facts before me. However, I have no doubt that the sheriff can sell the interest of the debtor-joint tenant which has been seized by a WSS. Finally, my decision is confined to the interest of a joint tenant in land and it does not extend to other forms of jointly held assets, such as joint bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The appeal is allowed.
