<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Front Row Investment
                    Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Front Row”) for an order to set
                    aside part of an award dated 3 July 2009 (“the Award”) of the
                    arbitrator (“the Arbitrator”) in an arbitration involving Daimler
                    South East Asia Pte Ltd (“Daimler”) as claimant, and Front Row as
                    respondent. The part of the Award sought to be set aside was in respect of Front
                    Row’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The ground upon which the application was
                    founded was that the Arbitrator had breached the rule of natural justice
                    expressed in the Latin maxim <em>audi alteram partem</em>.
                    In particular, the Arbitrator had inexplicably concluded that Front Row relied
                    upon only one of three misrepresentations when there was no basis on which he
                    could have concluded that Front Row had abandoned reliance on the
                rest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Section 48(1)(<em>a</em>)(vii) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”) provides that an arbitral award may be set aside
                    by the High Court if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the
                        making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced;
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The threshold which an applicant under s 48(1)(<em>a</em>)(vii) has to surmount is high. It is particularly so in
                    the present case, given the undoubted calibre and experience of the Arbitrator.
                    Nevertheless, after hearing the parties’ submissions and in the absence of
                    any serious attempt by Daimler’s counsel to explain away the
                    Arbitrator’s apparent misapprehension, I allowed Front Row’s
                    application. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Front Row is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. It was set up specifically for a joint venture with Daimler. Daimler
                    is also a company incorporated in Singapore. It was previously known as
                    DaimlerChrysler South East Asia Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Front Row and Daimler were parties to an
                    agreement dated 15 September 2005 (“the Agreement”) by which
                    they agreed jointly to organise and run a series of races across South East Asia
                    using 35 specially built light-weight Mercedes-AMG SLK 55 cars. This series of
                    races was to be called the “Asian Cup Series”. Under the
                    Agreement, Front Row was responsible for financing the venture whilst Daimler
                    was responsible for organising the Asian Cup Series. As part of Daimler’s
                    obligation to organise the Asian Cup Series, it was to second one of its
                    employees, Mr Thomas Buehler (“Buehler”), to Front Row to act
                    as its general manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The background to and terms of the joint venture
                    were reflected in two key documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     A pre-contractual powerpoint
                        presentation titled “Daimler Chrysler Project Asian Cup”,
                        dated 6 July 2005, which Buehler sent to Front Row’s chief
                        executive officer, Mr Daniel Prager (“Prager”), on
                        26 July 2005. This presentation was a “Concept/Feasibility
                        Study” of the joint venture; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Agreement, the key terms of which included
                        the following paragraphs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From the foregoing, it is clear that Front
                    Row’s obligations under the Agreement were to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     purchase the cars as specified by
                        Daimler and manufactured by Mercedes-AMG GmbH, a company related to Daimler;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     provide the
                        working capital required to fund the running of the Asian Cup
                    Series.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the other hand, Daimler’s obligations under
                    the same were to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     organise, brand and promote the
                        Asian Cup Series;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     organise up to 20 races per year for two years with each race weekend
                        holding two races; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     ensure that Buehler will devote 100% of his time and effort to the
                        running and organisation of the Asian Cup Series.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    Agreement also provided that all disputes between Front Row and Daimler arising
                    out of or in connection with the Agreement should be settled in Singapore by a
                    single arbitrator applying the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
                    International Chamber of Commerce (“the ICC Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Front Row duly purchased the said 35 SLK 55 cars
                    which were specially built for the racing series. However, according to Front
                    Row, Daimler failed to keep its side of the bargain. There was practically no
                    organisation, branding or promotion on Daimler’s part. Daimler only
                    organised three races and none of the races had sufficient participation. The
                    number of participants fell steadily from 15 in the first race, which was
                    half the expected number, to six in the second, and five in the third. In
                    respect of the three failed races, Front Row suffered a total loss of
                    $40,586.53.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to Front Row, following the failure of
                    the third race, it became apparent to Front Row that the Asian Cup Series was
                    not going to be a success. Consequently, Front Row’s director and
                    shareholder, Mr Yeo Wee Koon (“Yeo”), tried to make the best
                    of the situation by suggesting that Front Row stage a supporting event for the
                    A1 Grand Prix in March 2007 using the SLK 55 cars. However, he was informed by
                    Mercedes-AMG via a letter on 27 March 2007 (“the Letter”)
                    that that was not possible as the SLK 55 cars had not been made for actual
                    racing. They had been developed only for use in “driving training
                    programmes … which [did] not involve the cars competing against each
                    other”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Shortly after Front Row received the Letter,
                    Buehler stopped working for Front Row. In June 2008, Front Row attempted to sell
                    the cars back to Mercedes-AMG but without success. Front Row was also unable to
                    find any buyer for the cars as they were usable neither on normal roads nor as
                    race cars.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 22 February 2008, Daimler commenced
                    arbitration proceedings against Front Row, claiming $610,506.06 from Front Row
                    for the sums invoiced as Buehler’s salary under the Agreement (“the
                    Arbitration”). In the Arbitration, Front Row denied liability for the
                    same and asserted, as set out in the Terms of Reference, that Daimler:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [had] not fulfilled its contractual duties; specifically its
                        duties to <em>organize [sic], brand and promote the
                            AMG-Mercedes South East Asia Cup Series</em>; failed to make any
                        or any reasonable efforts to organise up to 20 races per year for two years
                        with each race weekend holding two races and failed to ensure that Thomas
                        Buehler devoted 100% of his time and effort to the running and organisation
                        of the Asian Cup Series. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Front Row also brought the counterclaim, based
                    on misrepresentation, against Daimler contending that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in order to induce [Front Row] to enter into the Agreement
                        [Daimler] had promised and/or represented and/or is legally responsible for
                        the <em>representations that</em> the SLK AMG cars were
                        appropriate for, had been specially designed and adapted and would be
                        permitted for use in non professional racing to be conducted under the South
                        East Asian Cup Series competitive events, and that <em>20
                            races would be organised as the AMG-Mercedes South East Asian Cup
                            Series. Contrary to their promise and/or representation, [Daimler]
                            organised only 3 races</em> and the SLK AMG cars were not
                        appropriate for racing or competitive events. Alternatively, [Daimler was]
                        legally responsible for the consequences of the representations that were
                        false and negligently made and induced [Front Row] to enter into the
                        Agreement. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Both Daimler’s claim and Front
                    Row’s counterclaim were dismissed by the Arbitrator. In respect of the
                    latter, the Arbitrator noted at para 33 of the Award that Front Row had
                    formulated its counterclaim in the following manner, which he adopted: Whether
                    [Front Row] was induced to enter into the Agreement by one or more
                    representations made by or on behalf of [Daimler].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Arbitrator then found, at paras 55
                    and 56 of the Award, that by the time Front Row’s case closed, its case
                    had narrowed to just one representation, which was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55.    … the event cars could be used for racing,
                            and that this misrepresentation turned out to be false when Mercedes
                            indicated that ‘actual racing’ was not
                        permitted.</p>

              <em>[Front Row] had</em>

                            the absence of FIA homologation for the event cars. <em>Thus, having asserted that it was induced to enter into the

                                a</em><b><em>single</em></b><em>alleged misrepresentation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Following his finding that Front Row’s
                    case of misrepresentation had narrowed to just one representation, he took the
                    view, at para 61 of the Award, that the “race-worthiness” of
                    the SLK 55 cars was the “key question” in the arbitration before
                    him:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The key question was ultimately whether the letter from
                            Mercedes was directed at a departure from the Series, or effectively
                            prohibited what had gone on before</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The answer to this question was dependent on
                    the meaning and effect of the Letter. The Arbitrator found, at para 67 of
                    the Award, that Mercedes had only indicated that professional racing (<em>ie</em>, the type of racing which required the racing cars to
                    have FIA homologation) and not <em>all</em> racing
                    (including the type which had taken place in the three races organised as part
                    of the Asian Cup Series) was prohibited. Since Daimler’s representation to
                    Front Row was only that the SLK 55 cars could be used for some form of
                    racing, and not any “professional racing”, the Arbitrator found
                    that Daimler had not been shown to have induced Front Row to enter into the
                    Agreement by any false representation. Accordingly, Front Row failed in its
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Dissatisfied with the outcome of the
                    arbitration, Front Row filed this originating summons on 1 October 2009 and
                    prayed for the following orders, <em>inter
                    alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the part of the Award dealing
                        with Front Row’s counterclaim be set aside as a whole or to the extent
                        as may be determined by this court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     that that part of the Award so set aside be
                        tried afresh by a newly appointed Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Front Row did not challenge the merits of the
                    Arbitrator’s decision concerning the race-worthiness of the SLK 55 cars as
                    that course of action was not open to it. Instead, Front Row based its
                    application to this court on the Arbitrator’s finding that in the end
                    Front Row was asserting inducement from a <em>single</em>
                    misrepresentation. It said that the question whether the Letter was directed at
                    a departure from the Asian Cup Series or effectively prohibited what had gone on
                    in the three previous races was <em>not</em> the only
                    question which had been placed before the Arbitrator for his determination.
                    According to Front Row, it had not abandoned the ground in the counterclaim,
                    that it had relied on Daimler’s representation, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the latter would organise, brand and promote the Asian
                    Cup Series. Accordingly, in reaching his decision under the erroneous impression
                    that Front Row had abandoned such ground, the Arbitrator had breached a
                    principle of natural justice as he would then not have considered the merits of
                    Front Row’s submissions and arguments made in relation
                thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As stated earlier, Daimler did not make any
                    serious attempt to explain away the Arbitrator’s apparent misapprehension.
                    Dr Rudiger Friedrich Ackermann (“Dr Ackermann”),
                    Daimler’s attorney before the Arbitrator, tried to defend the
                    Arbitrator’s finding by pointing to oral submissions made by Front
                    Row’s counsel which had focused entirely on the Letter (see
                    Dr Ackermann’s affidavit filed on 26 October 2009, at
                    paras 34 and 57). However, it was explained by Ms Sunita Sonya Parhar,
                    Front Row’s solicitor before the Arbitrator that the oral submissions
                    focused entirely on the Letter only because Front Row was addressing specific
                    questions which the Arbitrator had posed to both parties during the oral hearing
                    held on 20 February 2009 (see paras 5 to 9 of Ms Sunita Sonya
                    Parhar’s affidavit filed on 9 November 2009). To that explanation
                    there was no effective rebuttal. Before me, Daimler’s counsel made no
                    further mention of this argument. Neither did Daimler’s counsel challenge
                    Front Row’s legal submissions on the effect of the Arbitrator’s
                    failure to consider Front Row’s submissions with regard to the
                    representations which the Arbitrator concluded had been abandoned. His counter,
                    rather, was that the representations alleged to have been made in fact formed no
                    part of Front Row’s claim under misrepresentation. This will be dealt with
                    in greater detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In order to establish that a breach of natural
                    justice had occurred such that the Award may be set aside, Front Row had to
                    satisfy the test set out by Choo Han Teck J in <em>John
                        Holland Pty Ltd v Toyo Engineering Corp (Japan)</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 443 and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Soh Beng
                    Tee</em>”). At [29] of <em>Soh Beng Tee</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been rightly held in <em>John Holland Pty Ltd v Toyo
                            Engineering Corp (Japan) [2001] 1 SLR(R) 443</em>

                        at [18], that a party challenging an arbitration award as having

                            award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced its rights</em></b>. …

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In summary, the outcome of Front Row’s
                    application turned on five issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether Front Row had, in its
                        counterclaim against Daimler, pleaded Daimler’s representation that it
                        would support Front Row in organising, branding and promoting the Asian Cup
                        Series and, in particular, that it would organise 20 races over ten weekends
                        per annum with 30 cars;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether, in the course of the arbitration proceedings,
                        Front Row had ceased to rely on the same;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Arbitrator’s failure to
                        consider the same amounted to a breach of a principle of natural justice.
                        (This involved a consideration of two sub-issues, namely, (i) which
                        principle of natural justice had been breached; and (ii) how the Arbitrator
                        breached this principle);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the Arbitrator’s breach was connected to
                        the making of the Award; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether the Arbitrator’s breach prejudiced Front
                        Row’s rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The alleged representations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At para 22 of its submissions before this
                    court, Front Row relied on Yeo’s affidavit which stated that the decision
                    to enter into the joint venture with Daimler was founded, <em>inter alia</em>, on three main representations Daimler made in the
                    Concept/Feasibility Study and the Agreement. Paragraph 76 of Yeo’s
                    affidavit provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">a.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">First, that the Asian Cup Series was to be a
                                <em>race</em> series;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">b.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Second, that the 35 specially prepared event cars
                            had been specially developed, adapted and were appropriate for and would
                            be used in the races conducted under the Asian Cup Series;
                        and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">c.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Third, that Daimler would give [Front Row] its full
                            backing and support in marketing, promoting and organising the Asian Cup
                            Series, and in particular, that it would organise 20 races over 10
                            weekends per annum with 30 cars [‘the
                            Representation’].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The only representation relevant for our consideration is that
                    referred to in sub-para (c) (hereafter referred to as “the
                    Representation”). Although the Representation was described by Yeo in
                    terms set out in sub-para (c) above, references in the ReRe-Amended Answer
                    and Counterclaim to her Representation were more specifically to the latter part
                    of the Representation, <em>viz</em>, the organisation of 20
                    races. However, references to the Representation as a whole were subsequently
                    made in Front Row’s opening and closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Front Row’s counterclaim against Daimler was founded, <em>inter alia</em>, on the Representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Daimler argued that the Representation did not
                    form part of Front Row’s claim for misrepresentation at all. It relied on
                    paras 11 to 13 and 24 of Front Row’s ReRe-Amended Answer and
                    Counterclaim for its contention that there was no allegation by Front Row that
                    Daimler had made the Representation; the requirement that Daimler organise,
                    brand and promote the Asian Cup Series only appeared in relation to Front
                    Row’s defence for its alleged breach of the Agreement (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above); it did not form any part of its
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It must be said that the ReRe-Amended Answer
                    and Counterclaim could have been better drafted. Nevertheless, on a close
                    scrutiny of the ReRe-Amended Answer and Counterclaim, I was of the view that
                    Daimler’s argument was not tenable. The pleadings in the Answer in
                    paras 10 to 13, which are set out below, clearly included the
                    Representation:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">At para 26 of the same, Front Row had averred (albeit with
                    reference to the Agreement) that Daimler’s obligations under the Agreement
                    were precisely to organise and promote the Asian Cup Series, as mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… contrary to [Daimler’s] obligations, assurances and
                        assertions under the Agreement, [Daimlers] failed to <u>make any or any reasonable efforts to organise up to 20 races per year
                            for two years with each race weekend holding two races</u>
                        … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Further, at para 28 of the ReRe-Amended
                    Answer and Counterclaim, under the heading “Counterclaim”, Front
                    Row pleaded:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By way of Counterclaim, [Front Row] <em>repeat</em>[<em>s</em>] <em>paragraphs 1 to 26 above</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It then stated explicitly in the next paragraph that Daimler’s
                    misrepresentations and breaches of the Agreement were the cause of its loss, and
                    thus the basis of its counterclaim. Paragraph 29 averred as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Front Row avers] that <em>by reason of [Daimler’s]
                            misrepresentations</em> and breach of the Agreement <em>in not performing their obligations and not promoting,
                            organizing</em> [<em>sic</em>]<em>, initiating, staging or otherwise bringing about the
                            AMG-Mercedes South East Asian Cup Series</em>, [Front Row has]
                        suffered loss. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Whilst it might be argued that the words
                    “in not performing their obligations and not promoting, organizing,
                    initiating, staging or otherwise bringing about the AMG-Mercedes South East
                    Asian Cup Series” were in amplification of the breach of the Agreement
                    rather than in reference to Daimler’s misrepresentation, it could be
                    inferred from paras 28 and 29 of the ReRe-Amended Answer and Counterclaim
                    that Front Row not only regarded Daimler’s breach of obligation to
                    organise, brand and promote the Asian Cup Series as a defence against
                    Daimler’s claim for breach of the Agreement; it also treated
                    Daimler’s misrepresentation as to its intention to undertake particular
                    actions (in particular to organise and promote the Asian Cup Series) as a ground
                    for its counterclaim. Why else would Front Row repeat paras 1 to 26 under
                    the counterclaim? I was also guided by the Terms of Reference agreed upon by
                    both parties and by Front Row’s opening and closing submissions during the
                    arbitration proceedings. The Terms of Reference provided at page 4
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [Daimler] in order to induce [Front Row] to enter into the Agreement
                        had promised and/or represented and/or is <em>legally
                            responsible for the representations that … 20 races would be
                            organised as the AMG-Mercedes South East Asian Cup Series. Contrary to
                            their promise and/or representation</em>, [<em>Daimler</em>] <em>organised only 3
                            races</em> and the SLK AMG cars were not appropriate for racing or
                        competitive events. Alternatively, [Daimler was] legally responsible for the
                        consequences of the representations that were false and negligently made and
                        induced [Front Row] to enter into the Agreement. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Front Row’s outline opening submissions
                    were also replete with references to the promotion and organisation of the Cup
                    Series (see paras 1, 9 and 10). At para 14.a of the same, Front
                    Row explicitly stated that two sets of disputes had arisen between itself and
                    Daimler, the first being in relation to the question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>whether [Daimler] induced [Front Row] to
                            enter into the Agreement</em> specifically by virtue of <em>misrepresentations</em> that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i.    [Daimler] would be organising and promoting
                                a Cup Series which involved at its core a series of up to 20
                                races over 10 week-ends over a two year period for gentleman racing;
                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was reiterated at para 15 of the same:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Front Row] further addresses the same issues as set out in 14.a. above as
                        contractual breach <em>as well as
                            misrepresentation</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Later at para 78 of the same, Front Row emphasised that the
                    fundamental basis of its claim in misrepresentation lay in the
                    representations made by Daimler to Front Row, which were eventually found in the
                    Concept/Feasibility Study and the Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78.    The fundamental
                            basis of [Front Row’s] claim in misrepresentation has already been
                            outlined above. Nevertheless in relation to each of these elements it is
                            convenient to refer to the guiding legal principles.</p>

                                written presentation referred to above and in many cases reconfirmed
                                in the Agreement itself. … [Front Row] in particular relies

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In its written closing submissions, Front Row
                    then reiterated its position that Daimler had made representations that it would
                    organise, brand and promote the Asian Cup Series. Under the heading
                    “Brief Summary of the Story”, Front Row submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Daimler together with Front Row would <em>organise</em> and <em>Daimler would

                            the monies expended under a contract induced by misrepresentation.
                            Daimler essentially bears this financial risk in the event that it turns
                            out that Daimler <em>procured the Agreement by a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Considering Front Row’s ReRe-Amended
                    Answer and Counterclaim and its opening and closing submissions in their
                    totality, it was clear to me that Front Row’s claim for misrepresentation
                    was founded on the Representation, <em>inter alia</em>.
                    Indeed, the Arbitrator himself referred to the Representation in the Award,
                    albeit in the context of finding that Front Row had ceased to rely on this
                    representation in its case of misrepresentation against Daimler. Under the
                    heading “Misrepresentation Issue” at para 56 of the Award,
                    the Arbitrator said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Front Row] had ceased to rely on a number of points pleaded,
                        in particular on [Daimler’s] alleged failure to organise 20 races
                        … Thus, having asserted that it was induced to enter into the
                        Agreement by reason of several misrepresentations, the Respondent ended up
                        asserting inducement from a single alleged misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From para 56 of the Award, it can be seen that the Arbitrator
                    accepted that Front Row did plead that Daimler had represented that it
                    would organise 20 races, that this representation was one of the grounds which
                    Front Row had relied upon in its claim for misrepresentation, and that Front Row
                    had ceased to rely on the same. Also, I noted that this representation that
                    Daimler would organise 20 races was part of what organising, branding and
                    promoting entailed. What the Arbitrator dealt with in the Award was more the
                    specific than the general. Accordingly, I was of the view that Daimler could not
                    argue that the Representation did not form any part of Front Row’s
                    counterclaim and was relied upon only in Front Row’s defence against
                    Daimler’s claim for Buehler’s salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arbitrator breached a fundamental principle of natural justice
                which requires him to give parties a fair hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Section 48(1)(<em>a</em>)(vii) of the Act provides that the High Court may set aside an

<p class="Judg-1">There are two fundamental principles of natural justice. These are
                    reflected in the maxims <em>nemo judex in causa sua</em>
                    and <em>audi alteram parterm</em>, which were explained by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> (at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [43]:</p>

                        [1978] VR 385 at 396, Marks J helpfully distilled the essence
                        of the two pillars of natural justice in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The first is that an adjudicator must be disinterested and unbiased.
                            This is expressed in the Latin maxim – the <em>nemo
                                judex in causa sua</em>. <b><em>The second
                                principle is that the parties must be given adequate notice and
                                opportunity to be heard. This in turn is expressed in the familiar
                                Latin maxim – audi alteram partem</em></b><em>. In considering the evidence in this case, it is important to
                                bear in mind that each of the two principles may be said to have
                                sub-branches or amplifications. One amplification of the first rule
                                is that justice must not only be done but appear to be
                                done;</em> (Lord Hewart, C.J. in <em>R. v
                                Sussex Justices; ex parte McCarthy</em>, [1924] 1 K.B.
                            256 at p 259; [1923] All E.R. Rep. 233). <b><em>Sub-branches of the second principle are that each party must be
                                given a fair hearing and a fair opportunity to present its case.
                                Transcending both principles are the notions of fairness and
                                judgment only after a full and fair hearing given to all
                                parties</em></b>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Pacific Recreation Pte
                        Ltd v SY Technology Inc</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491, the Court
                    of Appeal held that a court or tribunal would be in breach of natural justice if
                    it decided a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, since
                    the affected party would have been deprived of its opportunity to be heard or to
                    address the issues upon which the case was decided: at [30]. The corollary is
                    plainly also true – that a court or tribunal will be in breach of natural
                    justice if in the course of reaching its decision, it disregarded the
                    submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues (without considering
                    the merits thereof). Otherwise, the requirement to comply with the maxim
                        <em>audi alteram partem</em> would be hollow and
                    futile, satisfied by the mere formality of allowing a party to say whatever it
                    wanted without the tribunal having to address or even understand and consider
                    whatever had been said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As the Court of Appeal noted in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [65(a)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parties to arbitration have, in general, a right to be heard effectively
                        on every issue that may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This principle is reflected in the decision of
                    the High Court in <em>Koh Bros Building and Civil Engineering
                        Contractor Pte Ltd v Scotts Development (Saraca) Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 1063 at [47], namely, that the basic duty of an arbitrator is
                    to listen to both sides of the argument and give each side an opportunity to
                    submit on all relevant points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In that case, the applicant contractors had
                    applied to the arbitrator for an interim award of the sum claimed. The
                    developers objected on the ground of <em>res judicata</em>
                    and the arbitrator agreed to hear their preliminary objections on that ground to
                    the application for an interim award. At the hearing, the developer’s
                    counsel objected additionally to the application for an interim award on the
                    basis that the matter was not an appropriate one for summary disposal. Counsel
                    for the contractors quite rightly did not address the additional ground at the
                    hearing but focussed on the issue of <em>res judicata</em>
                    since that had been the only issue for which the hearing had been convened.
                    However, the arbitrator evidently agreed with the submissions of the
                    developer’s counsel on the latter ground for, after the hearing, the
                    arbitrator wrote to the parties to notify them that he did not consider it
                    appropriate to hear the application for an interim award. The contractor filed a
                    motion to remove the arbitrator on the basis of his misconduct pursuant to
                    s 17(1) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Ed) (since
                    repealed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Judith Prakash J agreed (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>) with the submission that the arbitrator had
                    acted inappropriately because he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… came to a decision on a point without giving the contractors the
                        opportunity of putting forward submissions and evidence on that
                        point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Prakash J ruled (at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>)
                    that there had been a breach of natural justice because the arbitrator
                    had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     gone beyond the boundaries of the
                        reference he had stipulated for the hearing on the application for an
                        interim award;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     failed to indicate clearly during the course of the hearing that he was
                        considering making a decision on the basis of the submission on the
                        additional ground which had not been addressed by the contractors;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     failed to
                        afford parties an opportunity to address him on the facts of the case so
                        that he could consider them in determining whether the issues could be dealt
                        with summarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The failure to allow a party to address
                    the tribunal on a key issue is the corollary to allowing the submission but then
                    ignoring it altogether whether deliberately or otherwise. In both cases, the
                    mischief is precisely the same: a party is denied the opportunity to address its
                    position to the judicial mind. As Front Row’s counsel posed rhetorically
                    at para 37 of its submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the award of an arbitrator who admittedly fails to consider a vital
                        argument is nonetheless immune from challenge, then is it equally immaterial
                        that he was so wholly distracted that he did not register the argument at
                        all and failed to consider it because he did not know it had been made? Is
                        it equally immune from challenge if he absents himself altogether from the
                        hearing but asks counsel to send him a recording of the argument and then
                        fails to listen to it?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That this cannot be right is demonstrated by a line of Australian
                    cases in which the courts have considered the duty of an arbitrator or
                    adjudicator in similar circumstances. These cases deal with applications by the
                    plaintiffs seeking to impugn the determination by adjudicators of claims arising
                    under the New South Wales Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment
                    Act 1999 (“the NSW SOP Act”). Section 22 of the NSW SOP Act
                    deals with the contents of a determination and s 22(2) sets out the matters
                    to which an adjudicator must have regard when reaching his decision on the
                    application. These include, <em>inter alia</em>, all the
                    submissions made by the claimant and respondent in support of their respective
                    cases. Section 22(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining an adjudication application, the adjudicator is to consider

                    [2005] NSWSC 548 (“<em>Timwin</em>”) concerned the adjudicator’s failure to
                    consider a reason given by the plaintiff, Timwin, for withholding certain
                    payments to Façade. Timwin had advanced three reasons for resisting

                    understanding the reason, using the words “whatever that means” in
                    relation to Timwin’s explanation of that reason (see [14]) of Timwin.
                    Façade had, however, addressed and rebutted that particular reason in its
                    submissions. McDougall J was of the view that if the adjudicator was
                    seeking to understand Timwin’s explanations, he would have referred to
                    Façade’s apparent understanding and rebuttal. As he did not attempt to
                    understand and address the issues before him, he had denied Timwin natural
                    justice. McDougall J’s remarks bear repetition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    In <em>Brodyn</em> at para [55], Hodgson JA summarised
                            the basis on which the Courts might intervene as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘. . . the legislature did not intend that exact compliance with
                            all the more detailed requirements was essential to the existence of a
                            valid determination … What was intended to be essential was
                            compliance with the basic requirements … a bona fide attempt by
                            the adjudicator to exercise the relevant power relating to the subject
                            matter of the legislation and reasonably capable of reference to this
                            power … and no substantial denial of the measure of natural
                            justice that the Act requires to be given. If the basic requirements are
                            not complied with, or if a purported determination is not such a bona
                            fide attempt, or if there is a substantial denial of this measure of
                            natural justice, then in my opinion a purported determination will be
                            void and not merely voidable, because there will then not, in my
                            opinion, be satisfaction of requirements that the legislature has
                            indicated as essential to the existence of a valid
                            determination.’</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    There has not been any decision to my knowledge
                            elaborating the requirement of good faith to which Hodgson JA pointed in
                                <em>Brodyn</em>. Clearly, I think, his Honour
                            was not referring to dishonesty or its opposite. I think he was
                            suggesting that, as is well understood in the administrative law
                            context, <em>there must be an effort to understand and
                                deal with the issues in the discharge of the statutory
                                function</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In the present case, I think that an available, and
                            better, inference is that <em>the adjudicator did not
                                consider, in the sense that I have just explained, the submissions
                                for the parties in which the ambit of the dispute that was intended
                                to be raised in relation to variations was explained</em>. Had
                            he turned his mind to those submissions, he would have known what it was
                            the parties understood the dispute to be; what it was that they were
                            arguing. Because he did not, as it appears, turn his mind to those
                            submissions, he did not deal with the real dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    It is of course apparent that the adjudicator
                            turned his mind to the submissions for Timwin. However, [he did so] in

                            consideration to, the submissions for Façade, he could not reasonably
                            have done this. That, to my mind, supports rather than denies the
                            drawing of the inference that <em>the adjudicator did not
                                have regard to, or consider, the relevant

                        <em>Timwin</em> is that there will be a breach of
                    natural justice when the arbitrator disregards the submissions made by a party
                    during the hearing, or has regard to them but does not really try to understand
                    them and so fails to deal with the matter in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Lanskey v
                        Noxequin</em> [2005] NSWSC 963 (“<em>Lanskey</em>”), the adjudicator had incorrectly described
                    Lanskey’s defences to Noxequin’s claim for payment as set offs when
                    in fact some of Lanskey’s defences were to the effect that some work had
                    not been done at all and, as a result, Noxequin had not completed the work as a
                    whole. This was material because the claim was for final payment and release of
                    the retention sum. The court held that the adjudicator’s failure to
                    properly consider the submission as to whether the work had been done at all
                    amounted to a failure to accord Lanskey natural justice as required under
                    s 22 of the NSW SOP Act. The court held the adjudication determination to
                    be void, setting it aside. It reasoned at [15] of its judgment that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The course adopted by the Adjudicator when he described all the
                        plaintiff's claims as set offs, avoided the necessity for him to consider
                        the very detailed documents and submissions of the plaintiff that dealt with
                        the 69 items. <em>Plainly on the face of the documents there
                            was a real question about incomplete work that the Adjudicator has not
                            considered because of the way in which he dealt with the claims as set
                            offs. It is clear therefore that he has not considered the plaintiff
                            submissions in this respect and this is apparent on the face of his
                            reasons. Having regard to his obligations to consider of the submissions
                            under section 22 of the Act this failure means that the plaintiff has
                            not been accorded natural justice</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It was submitted on behalf of Front Row that
                    although <em>Lanskey</em> was decided on the basis of
                    certain statutory provisions, the same reasoning can be applied in the present
                    case since it is not just a requirement of statute but rather one which is also
                    enshrined in the common law, that an arbitrator fairly consider the issues
                    before him. I agree and would also note that ultimately the court held that
                    Lanskey had not been accorded natural justice. The propositions which Front
                    Row’s counsel submitted (and I agree) may be distilled from <em>Lanskey</em> are that, first, a tribunal has at least to
                    consider all issues that have been raised by parties. Secondly, the court will
                    look at the face of the documents and the tribunal’s decision to determine
                    whether the tribunal has in fact fulfilled its duty to apply its mind to the
                    issues placed by the parties before it and considered the arguments
                    raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Trysams Pty Ltd v Club
                        Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd</em> [2007] NSWSC 941
                        (“<em>Trysams</em>”), Trysams had first
                    relied on a report to show that some tiles were defective, thus justifying
                    retention of payment. The adjudicator held that Club Constructions had not had
                    the opportunity to consider the report at the time of the application for
                    adjudication and so disregarded it. Trysams submitted that the report should
                    have been considered by the adjudicator and that his failure to consider the
                    report was a breach of natural justice. The court accepted that it was so. At
                    [49], [60] and [61], the court held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49.    In my view, the report was either part of a
                            submission or relevant documentation in support of a submission
                            “duly made” by the plaintiff in support of the
                            schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60.    The report contained information of critical
                            importance to the plaintiff in establishing its reasons for withholding
                            payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61.    Despite the interim nature of an adjudication,
                            natural justice nevertheless clearly required the adjudicator to
                            consider the report unless (even if erroneously) he determined that it
                            was, or was part of, a submission not duly made. In this case, he made
                            no such determination. This amounted to a substantial failure to afford
                            natural justice which worked practical injustice on the plaintiff and
                            rendered the whole adjudication void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Trysams had also put in a counterclaim for
                    liquidated damages. The adjudicator stated that Trysams had not given him
                    sufficient information to enable him to assess liquidated damages, as Trysams
                    had not advised him of the date of practical completion of the units. As such,
                    he made no finding on that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Counsel for Club Constructions readily
                    conceded before Hammerschlag J that the adjudicator had been provided with
                    sufficient information for him to have assessed liquidated damages. However, he
                    submitted that in determining that Trysams had provided insufficient information
                    to assess any liquidated damages, the adjudicator had simply made an
                    “unfortunate mistake” in failing to consider the submission which,
                    he submitted, was insufficient to make the adjudication void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The court found that the adjudicator had been
                    provided with sufficient information to have assessed liquidated damages as, on
                    the face of the adjudicator’s written decision, Trysams <em>had</em> advised its determination of the date of practical
                    completion and, moreover, the adjudicator made reference to this date in his own
                    decision. As such, the court held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83.    In my view, the mistake was not one of the quality
                            submitted on behalf of the first defendant. The adjudicator, in the face
                            of his own findings, simply did not proceed to adjudicate the
                            plaintiff’s claim for liquidated damages as the Act required him
                            to do. Having regard to his own findings, it is not open to conclude
                            that he made a conscientious, but mistaken, assessment of that claim.
                                <em>What he did was to fail to adjudicate a claim on
                                material which he clearly must have known was before
                            him</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">84.    That the adjudicator’s failure worked
                            substantial practical injustice on the plaintiff is self-evident from
                            the fact that there was no ready answer to the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85.    It is open to articulate what the adjudicator did
                            as both a failure, bona fide, to attempt to exercise the relevant power
                            with respect to the liquidated damages claim, <em>and a
                                failure to afford the level of natural justice required by the Act
                                to be given to the plaintiff. Either way, his error rendered the
                                whole determination void</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     All three Australian cases were recently
                    considered by Prakash J in <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd
                        v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2009] SGHC 257
                        (“<em>SEF Construction</em>”). In
                        <em>SEF Construction</em>, the defendant, Skoy, sought
                    payment from the plaintiff, SEF, under a building contract by bringing an
                    adjudication application under the Building and Construction Industry Security
                    of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the SOP Act”).
                    The adjudicator determined that SEF was to pay Skoy a certain sum of money. SEF
                    sought to set aside this adjudication determination. It contended that although
                    it had relied on four grounds to contend that Skoy’s adjudication
                    application was invalid, the adjudicator had only dealt with two of those four
                    grounds in giving his reasons for his determination. SEF therefore argued,
                    first, (at [28] and [33]) that the adjudicator’s failure to consider duly
                    made submissions amounted to a breach of his duty to consider the same in good
                    faith under s 17(3) of the SOP Act; and second, (at [31] and [48]) that in
                    line with <em>Timwin, Lanskey</em> and <em>Trysams</em>, the adjudicator’s failure to deal with the two
                    issues amounted to a failure to exercise his powers under the SOP Act in good
                    faith and constituted a breach of his duty to comply with the rules of natural
                    justice as prescribed by s 16(3)(c) of the SOP Act. Prakash J
                    found that it would be superfluous to import a duty to act in good faith from
                    administrative law as s 16(3) of the SOP Act was clear about the manner in
                    which the adjudicator had to conduct the arbitration, mandating that he acted
                    independently, impartially and in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, she also said
                    at [58] that: “[w]hat the Australians say in regard to good faith can be
                    applied to the requirements of natural justice as well”. Prakash J
                    then turned to the question whether the adjudicator had breached the rules of
                    natural justice. On the facts, she found that in arriving at his decision,
                    the adjudicator did have regard to the respective submissions and material
                    before him, even though he had omitted to state explicitly his reasons for
                    rejecting the same. Accordingly, there was no breach of natural justice. The
                    following passages from <em>SEF Construction</em> are
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    There can be no
                            doubt that the letter of the <em>audi alteram
                                partem</em> principle was observed in this case. The
                            Adjudicator called for submissions from both parties so SEF had the
                            opportunity to raise all the arguments that it wanted to in the
                            submissions without any restriction. Then, it is obvious that the
                            Adjudicator read both sets of submissions as if he had not, he would not
                            have been able to explain in paragraph 20 the four grounds on which SEF
                            contended that the Adjudication Application was invalid. <b><em>The question that faces me is whether, notwithstanding
                                this, the Adjudicator still flouted the rule because he did not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    In the present case, having studied the
                            Adjudication Determination, I am satisfied that the Adjudicator did have

                            other material placed before him. The fact that he did not feel it
                            necessary to discuss his reasoning and explicitly state his conclusions
                            in relation to the third and fourth jurisdictional issues, though
                            unfortunate in that it gave rise to fears on the part of SEF that its
                            points were not thought about, cannot mean that he did not have regard
                            to those submissions at all. It may have been an accidental omission on
                            his part to indicate expressly why he was rejecting the submissions
                            since the Adjudicator took care to explain the reasons for his other
                            determinations and even indicated matters on which he was not making a
                            determination. Alternatively, he may have found the points so
                            unconvincing that he thought it was not necessary to explicitly state
                            his findings. Whatever may be the reason for the Adjudicator’s
                            omission in this respect, I do not consider that SEF was not afforded
                            natural justice.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In other words, Her Honour found that there
                    was no breach of natural justice in <em>SEF
                        Construction</em> because the adjudicator clearly had regard to the
                    submissions of parties and the material before him in arriving at his decision.
                    In contrast, I could not make a similar finding in the present case. The
                    Arbitrator had explicitly stated, at paras 55 and 56 of the Award, that he
                    was disregarding the issue concerning Daimler’s obligation to organise,
                    brand and promote the Asian Cup Series because Front Row had ceased to rely on
                    this issue. This was not a case where he had had regard to Front Row’s
                    submissions on the issue but accidentally omitted to state his reasons for
                    rejecting the same or had found the same to be so unconvincing as to render it
                    unnecessary to explicitly state his findings on it (<em>SEF

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The conclusion which I ineluctably came to was
                    that in failing to consider Front Row’s submissions on the Representation,
                    the Arbitrator failed to accord Front Row natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A causal nexus between the breach of natural justice and the making
                of the Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Not only was I convinced that the
                    Arbitrator’s failure to consider the Representation amounted to a breach
                    of natural justice, I was also convinced that this breach was causally linked to
                    his decision to dismiss Front Row’s counterclaim, thereby prejudicing
                    Front Row’s rights.</p>

                        GmbH</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 871 (“<em>Dongwoo</em>”), the Court of Appeal stated at [73]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the breach complained of must occur ‘in connection with the
                        making of the award’. Therefore, even if there had been a breach of
                        the rules of natural justice, a causal nexus must be established between the
                        breach and the award made …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     At para 67(i) of the Award, the
                    Arbitrator specifically found that Daimler “did not properly or fully
                    perform its obligation to promote the Series”. This was his basis for
                    concluding that Front Row had a defence to Daimler’s claim for
                    reimbursement of Buehler’s salary package. Had he known that the ground of
                    counterclaim based on the Representation was still extant, he could not have
                    dismissed the counterclaim without giving that ground due consideration, taking
                    into account, <em>inter alia</em>, Daimler’s failure
                    to organise the 20 races per year. I was therefore of the view that the breach
                    of natural justice was sufficiently connected to the arbitrator’s
                    dismissal of Front Row’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The breach prejudiced Front Row’s rights</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Finally, the court may only intervene to set
                    the Award aside where the Arbitrator’s breach of natural justice
                    prejudiced Front Row’s rights. Once again, <em>Soh Beng
                        Tee</em> (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> <em>supra</em>) and <em>Dongwoo</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> <em>supra</em>) were instructive. In the former, the Court
                    of Appeal held at [91] and [98] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91.    … in Singapore, <em>an

                            While this is obviously a lower hurdle than substantial prejudice, it
                            certainly does not embrace technical or procedural irregularities that
                            have caused no harm in the final analysis. <em>There must
                                be more than technical unfairness</em>. It is neither
                            desirable nor possible to predict the infinite range of factual
                            permutations or imponderables that may confront the courts in the
                            future. What we can say is that <em>to attract curial

                                If, on the other hand, the same result could or would ultimately
                                have been attained, or if it can be shown that the complainant could

                                regardless, the bare fact that the arbitrator might have
                                inadvertently denied one or both parties some technical aspect of a
                                fair hearing would almost invariably be insufficient to set aside

                            Award (‘YWK-1’ at page 71) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… the reimbursement of Buehler’s salary package was tied
                            to [Daimler’s] proper performance of its obligation to conduct
                            branding and promotion for the [Asian Cup] Series. <em>Indeed, [Daimler] had exclusive conduct of this matter. I agreed
                                with [Front Row] that the failure to make direct use of
                                [Daimler’s] database of customers was likely to have had
                                a serious impact on the success of the [Asian Cup]
                            Series</em>. I agreed that in these circumstances [Front Row] had
                            a defence to the claim for reimbursement of Buehler’s salary
                            package. (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70.    In other words, the Arbitrator dismissed
                            Daimler’s claim <em>because he made an unequivocal
                                finding that Daimler had not properly or fully performed its
                                obligation to promote the Asian Cup Series</em>. <u>As we have pointed out at [91] of Yeo’s affidavit,
                                the Arbitrator recognised and found that this particular
                                representation made by Daimler, that it would undertake
                                responsibility for the branding and promotion of the Asian Cup
                                Series, had been breached</u>, having regard to the fact that
                            Daimler would also second Buehler to Front Row to take full
                            responsibility for the organisation of the Asian Cup
                        Series.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72.    With all due respect, in this light, the
                            Arbitrator’s finding that Front Row could successfully rely on
                            this representation as a defence to Daimler’s claim but that Front
                            Row had ceased to rely on this same key representation by Daimler when
                            bringing its counterclaim against Daimler, is utterly irrational. It
                            does not make any sense that Front Row would have relied on this
                            representation in its defence but abandoned it for the purpose of its
                            own counterclaim. And indeed, there is nothing in the pleadings,
                            transcripts or submissions which support the Arbitrator’s
                            conclusion that this representation was abandoned by Front Row. Given
                            the Arbitrator’s finding on Daimler’s claim, namely that
                            Front Row could successfully assert Daimler’s failure to promote
                            the series, it is clear beyond doubt that Front Row should and would
                            have succeeded in its counterclaim if the Arbitrator had applied his
                            mind to and considered Front Row’s submissions on Daimler’s
                            failure to promote the series in respect of Front Row’s
                            counterclaim. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added underlined]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     While it is true that a key limb of Front
                    Row’s defence was also a key limb in its counterclaim, <em>viz</em>, Daimler’s failure “to organise, brand and
                    promote the Cup Series, specifically, [its failure] to make reasonable efforts
                    to organise up to 20 races per year for 2 years” (at para 68 of
                    Front Row’s written submissions), this was in itself insufficient for
                    Front Row’s counterclaim to succeed. Paragraph 65, read with
                    para 68, of the written submissions mistakenly assumed that just because
                    Daimler had failed to organise, brand and promote the Asian Cup Series, in
                    particular, to organise 20 races per year for two years, Front Row’s
                    counterclaim had to succeed. This is not true. From my perusal of the Award,
                    Daimler’s claim for reimbursement of Buehler’s salary was dismissed
                    because it breached its contractual obligation to promote the Asian Cup Series
                    (In this regard, Front Row’s submission (at para 70 of its written
                    submissions) that the Arbitrator had dismissed Daimler’s claim for
                    reimbursement of Buehler’s salary because Daimler had breached its
                        <em>representation</em> that it would undertake
                    responsibility for the branding and promotion of the Asian Cup was erroneous).
                    However, it does not inexorably follow from the breach of Daimler’s
                    contractual obligation that Front Row would have succeeded in its counterclaim
                    based on misrepresentation. It has to be remembered that the alleged
                    misrepresentation was as to Daimler’s avowed intention to organise 20
                    races per year for the Asian Cup Series. It is not enough that Daimler failed to
                    do so. It must be proved on a balance of probability that when Daimler made the
                    Representation, it did not truly intend to carry out the avowed intention.
                    Having said that, it was not necessary for Front Row to satisfy me that it
                        <em>would</em> have succeeded in the counterclaim had
                    the Arbitrator not mistakenly concluded that Front Row had dropped the issue
                    with regard to the Representation (Indeed, it would be an unwarranted intrusion
                    for this court to go into the merits of the counterclaim). It sufficed that the
                    Arbitrator had failed to consider the issue because of his misapprehension that
                    it had been dropped, provided such failure prejudiced the rights of Front Row in
                    that the Arbitrator did not get round to considering whether Front Row’s
                    claim with respect to the Representation had been made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As I have concluded earlier, an
                    arbitrator’s failure to consider material arguments or submissions is a
                    breach of natural justice. In the present case, the Arbitrator had dismissed
                    Front Row’s counterclaim without considering the grounds of its
                    counterclaim in full because he was under the misapprehension that Front Row had
                    abandoned its reliance on the Representation. Had he not been mistaken, he would
                    have had to decide whether or not the Representation was false. A decision that
                    there had been a misrepresentation in regard thereto would have resulted in an
                    award in favour of Front Row, assuming the other ingredients for a successful
                    claim (<em>viz</em>, “reliance” and
                    “detriment”) were satisfied. It was not for me to delve further
                    into the question whether Front Row’s reliance upon the Representation
                    would have succeeded but for the arbitrator’s misrepresentation.
                    It sufficed that the Arbitrator failed to consider such a material ground.
                    That alone was sufficient prejudice to Front Row.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the result, I allowed Front Row’s
                    application and ordered that the part of the Award dealing with Front
                    Row’s counterclaim and with costs of the Arbitration be set aside as a
                    whole. I further ordered that the part of the Award so set aside be tried afresh
                    by a newly appointed arbitrator. Finally, I also ordered that the costs of and
                    incidental to Front Row’s application be paid by Daimler to Front
                    Row.</p>
