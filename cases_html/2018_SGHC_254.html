</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The defendant is right not to take this point. What constitutes a “balcony” within the meaning of a by-law depends on the context: <span class="font-italic">Chong Ken Ban (alias Chong Johnson) and another v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1395 </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 138 at [17]. The purpose of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) is to ensure uniformity in the external appearance of The Arcadia. The sliding doors between the living room and the balcony, although set well back from the external wall of the balcony, remain visible to external observers. Those sliding doors form part of The Arcadia’s external appearance. Renovations to those sliding doors – no less than renovations to the cantilevered part of the balcony – have the potential to affect the external appearance of The Arcadia. Given its purpose, by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) must therefore encompass renovations anywhere on the balcony from the external wall of the balcony right back to the balcony’s shared boundary with the living room.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third difference: when the plaintiff can withhold consent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The third difference between the two by-laws is that by-law 3.0(a) contains a proviso that consent for general renovations cannot be unreasonably withheld whereas by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) contains no such proviso. The plaintiff’s intent in passing by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) is therefore to place balcony renovations in a special category, where the plaintiff has an absolute right to withhold approval even if to do so can be said objectively to be unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I am conscious that by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) may not be effective to confer this absolute right on the plaintiff. Even in relation to a renovation which falls within by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii), a subsidiary proprietor may have recourse to the Strata Titles Board under s 101(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act. That provision allows a subsidiary proprietor, amongst others, to seek an order compelling a management corporation to grant approval for renovations where such approval has been unreasonably withheld (see the unreported Strata Titles Board decision in <span class="font-italic">MCST Plan No 2440 v Ee Min </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat/ Eileen Tan @ Tan Ai Lian </span>STB No 21 of 2016, at para 39). In a case which implicates s 37(4) of the Act in addition to a management corporation’s by-laws, the Strata Titles Board can even order the management corporation to consent to the renovation under s 111(b) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Even though this legislative route exists to challenge the plaintiff’s unreasonable refusal to consent to balcony renovations despite the express terms of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii), the distinction which the plaintiff has drawn expressly in its by-laws between general renovations and balcony renovations signals a clear intent to regulate balcony renovations strictly. That is a point I will return to later in this grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff did not give prior written approval</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 11 June 2011 letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 By-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) requires the defendant to obtain prior written approval for the Works.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I accept that the 11 June letter is not free from ambiguity. However, for the reasons which follow, I find that the defendant’s interpretation of the letter is not correct. Reading the umbrella paragraph and paragraph 2 together and in context, the natural meaning of the letter is that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">declined</span> to approve the proposed renovations to the balcony and to the main entrance <span class="font-italic">because</span> the plaintiff had made a positive determination that those renovations would affect the estate’s aesthetic uniformity or façade and were inconsistent with the plaintiff’s approval guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">An overarching point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 My first reason for arriving at this conclusion is an overarching one. At the time the plaintiff wrote the letter, it knew the scope of all of the actual renovation works which the defendant intended to carry out. In particular, the plaintiff knew the scope of the Works to the balcony. The pre-renovation floor plan attached to the defendant’s application for approval showed that the wall columns at the balcony were to be demolished. The post-renovation floor plan showed no wall columns in their place. The plaintiff appreciated this change when it issued the 11 June letter. That is why paragraph 2(i) of the letter expressly addresses the defendant’s “[p]roposed modification and <span class="font-italic">extension</span> of the balcony sliding door at the Living Area” (emphasis added). The plaintiff therefore had enough information at the time it wrote the letter to make a positive determination as to whether or not the Works affected the aesthetic uniformity of The Arcadia or its façade or were otherwise inconsistent with the plaintiff’s approval guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendant’s submission on the interpretation of the 11 June letter amounts to arguing that the plaintiff approved all of the defendant’s other <span class="font-italic">actual</span> renovations on 11 June (subject to compliance with the conditions listed in paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the letter) while making a wholly <span class="font-italic">general</span> point to the plaintiff in paragraph 2 – a point which was unrelated to the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> renovations which the defendant proposed to the balcony and to the main entrance door – that the two renovations listed in paragraph 2(i) and 2(ii) were approved<span class="font-italic"> unless</span> they affected the aesthetic uniformity of The Arcadia or its façade or were otherwise inconsistent with the plaintiff’s approval guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  If that is the correct interpretation of the 11 June letter, it means that the plaintiff approved the two renovations listed in paragraph 2 subject only to a condition <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> to be tested after the Works were complete. The 11 June letter was issued just two days before the plaintiff knew that demolition was to start.

</div>
</div> Further, 11 June 2011 was a Saturday and 13 June 2011 was a Monday. That leaves less than one working day between approval and commencement to arrive at that determination. Between 11 June 2011 and 13 June 2011, the plaintiff did not ask for and did not acquire any new information to arrive at a final decision on approval before demolition commenced. Thus, for example, the plaintiff did not ask the defendant for any information about the fit and finish to be applied to the balcony sliding doors. So, accepting the defendant’s interpretation of the 11 June letter requires accepting that the plaintiff was content to allow demolition to commence on 13 June 2011 without knowing whether the condition subsequent for approval would ever be satisfied. That appears to me a most unlikely interpretation of the 11 June letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendant’s interpretation is even less likely to be correct when one considers the subjective nature of the condition subsequent which the defendant submits the plaintiff imposed. Determining whether the Works affect the aesthetic uniformity or the façade or are inconsistent with the plaintiff’s approval guidelines is entirely subjective. Imposing a subjective condition subsequent is simply storing up a dispute for the future. If, after the Works were complete, the parties disagreed on whether the condition subsequent had been satisfied, whose determination would prevail? The plaintiff could not have intended the defendant’s determination to prevail. That would mean, in effect, that the 11 June letter delegated to the defendant the authority to make that determination unilaterally, either before commencing the Works or after they were complete. Nor could the plaintiff have intended that its own determination should prevail over the defendant’s contrary view. That would mean, in effect, that the plaintiff allowed the defendant to commence and complete the Works, thereby allowing defendant to present the plaintiff with a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span>, only for the plaintiff then, after the fact, to make its own determination and possibly order reinstatement. The defendant’s interpretation of the 11 June 2011 cannot be the correct interpretation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I bear in mind that the plaintiff was not content to rely on the general provisions of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to regulate balcony renovations. Instead, the plaintiff saw it fit to pass a specific by-law expressly prohibiting balcony renovations without the plaintiff’s prior written approval. I bear in mind also that the plaintiff saw it fit to exclude from that specific by-law the proviso which appears in by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and which prevents the plaintiff from unreasonably withholding approval for general renovations. Both of those points indicate to me that the plaintiff attached significance to a subsidiary proprietor’s obligation to secure written approval for balcony renovations <span class="font-italic">before the renovations were carried out</span> and special significance to having an unqualified right to withhold approval for balcony renovations <span class="font-italic">before the renovations were carried out</span>. Whether that right was in reality unqualified, bearing in mind s 101(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act, does not detract from a finding that by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) is evidence of a special significance which the plaintiff attached to balcony renovations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In these circumstances, it appears to me that the defendant’s submissions on the correct interpretation of the 11 June letter cannot be correct. The 11 June letter is not approval of the Works with a condition subsequent. It is a denial of approval for the Works. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Four features of the 11 June letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In support of her submission that the 11 June letter is correctly interpreted as conditional approval of the Works, the defendant relies on four features of the 11 June letter and of the context in which it was written.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">First feature – the umbrella paragraph</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The first feature is the umbrella paragraph of the 11 June letter. That paragraph conveys that the plaintiff has no objections to the defendant’s proposed renovations, makes that approval subject to conditions and then goes on to state the conditions that follow. The defendant argues that paragraph 2 is therefore nothing more than one of five conditions for the defendant to comply with in carrying out her proposed renovations and, more specifically, in carrying out the Works listed in sub-paragraphs 2(i) and 2(ii). The defendant complied with that condition because the Works do not “affect the aesthetic uniformity / façade” and are therefore not “inconsistent with [the plaintiff’s] approval guidelines”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I do not accept this submission. It is correct that the umbrella paragraph expressly approves the renovations subject to the defendant’s compliance with what follows. Although the umbrella paragraph does not speak in terms of “approval”, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between the plaintiff saying that it has “no objections” to the Works and the plaintiff giving express approval for the Works. But the defendant’s submissions on the express words of approval appearing in the umbrella paragraph do not in my view give proper weight to the express words of disapproval which appear in paragraph 2 of the 11 June letter:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2) All works that would affect the aesthetic uniformity / facade which are inconsistent with our approval guidelines <span class="font-italic">are not permitted</span>, <span class="font-italic">in particular the following</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">i) Proposed modification and extension of the balcony sliding door at the Living Area;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The words “are not permitted” in paragraph 2 are critical. These are unequivocal words signifying an intent to refuse approval. Paragraph 2(i) attaches this refusal of approval specifically to the Works. None of the other numbered paragraphs in the 11 June letter use the words “are not permitted” or attach those words to the renovations which they cover. The clarity of that specific intent, to my mind, suffices to override a general intent to approve which the umbrella paragraph conveys. The correct interpretation of the 11 June letter is that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">permitted</span> all of the defendant’s proposed renovations <span class="font-italic">save that</span> the proposed renovations to the balcony and to the main entrance were <span class="font-italic">not permitted</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The words “in particular the following” in paragraph 2 are also critical The words conveying a general intent to approve in the umbrella clause are subject to what follows the umbrella clause, which includes paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 says that all works of a certain kind are <span class="font-italic">not</span> permitted, in particular what follows in that paragraph. What follows in that paragraph is naturally understood as that which is <span class="font-italic">not</span> permitted. Paragraph 2, by using the words “in particular the following” immediately after stating the type of works which are “not permitted”, <span class="font-italic">particularises</span> two types of works which are not permitted. One of those types of works is precisely what the defendant carried out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The natural reading of the umbrella paragraph and paragraph 2 taken together is that the plaintiff denied approval for the Works. It could be said, though it is not necessary, that paragraph 2 contains an implied repetition of the words “are not permitted” after the word “following”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2) All works that would affect the aesthetic uniformity / facade which are inconsistent with our approval guidelines <span class="font-italic">are not permitted</span>, in particular the following [<span class="font-italic">are not permitted</span>]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">i) Proposed modification and extension of the balcony sliding door at the Living Area …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Further, paragraph 2 is quite different in nature from the numbered paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the 11 June letter. On the defendant’s submissions, paragraph 2 imposes a condition which seeks to regulate the design of the renovation to be carried out to the balcony and the main entrance. That is quite unlike paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5. These four paragraphs do not regulate the design of the renovations to which they pertain. Instead, these paragraphs set out conditions to ensure that the renovations to which they pertain are carried out in a manner which does not create a risk of damage to property or of injury to persons. The natural reading of the 11 June letter is to read paragraph 2 consistently with paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 as not attempting to regulate the design of the renovation to be carried out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Read that way, paragraph 2 is not a condition at all but a statement of the plaintiff’s standing policy not to permit “all works that would affect the aesthetic uniformity / façade which are inconsistent with our approval guidelines”. The correct interpretation of paragraph 2, then, is that it conveys a determination by the plaintiff that the specific renovations which the defendant proposes to make to her balcony and main entrance, in keeping with the plaintiff’s stated policy, “are not permitted”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Second feature – annotations on the floor plan</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The second feature on which the defendant relies are two annotations found on a copy of the pre-renovation floor plan which the defendant submitted to the plaintiff in June 2011 together with its application for approval of the renovations. That floor plan shows sliding doors extending partway along the boundary line between the living room and the balcony. Against these sliding doors appears the annotation “KIV”. In the bottom right hand corner of this floor plan appear the words “fit outs of exterior must match existing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The defendant relies on these annotations as evidence that the plaintiff had taken a decision to approve the Works subject to certain conditions in or about June 2011 and therefore as evidence supporting her interpretation of the 11 June letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I reject the defendant’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I accept that it is likely that these annotations were made for and on behalf of the plaintiff. That is because these annotations appear only on the copy of the floor plan which the plaintiff produced in the course of this application. The annotations do not appear on any copy of the pre-renovation floor plan in the defendant’s possession. Further, both Mr Voon Wong

</div> But there is no evidence as to who on the plaintiff’s side made the annotations, when they were made and with what intent. In particular, there is no evidence that the annotations were made by a person authorised by the plaintiff to make the final decision to approve the Works or that the annotations were made before the 11 June letter was issued, and are therefore capable of supplying context to its interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Further, even assuming that these two factual questions are resolved in favour of the defendant, the annotations do not amount to evidence of a positive decision by the plaintiff to approve the Works, whether or not subject to a condition subsequent. The abbreviation “KIV” means “keep in view”. “Keep in view” indicates that the plaintiff has <span class="font-italic">deferred</span> a decision on whether to approve the Works to a later date. Deferring a decision on the Works is undoubtedly not a rejection of the Works. But it is not approval of the Works either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The result is that even if the annotations supply a context for interpreting the 11 June letter, that context is simply that the plaintiff had decided to defer approval of the Works until it was satisfied that the Works would have no impact on the estate’s aesthetic uniformity or façade. Even if read in the light of that context, the 11 June letter amounts at most to an absence of objection. An absence of objection is not “prior written approval” within the meaning of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) read with by-law 1.0. In any case, these annotations cannot in themselves amount to the necessary “prior written approval”. They were not communicated to the defendant in or around June 2011. They came to the plaintiff’s knowledge only through the plaintiff’s affidavits filed in the course of this application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the circumstances, these annotations do not afford the defendant a contractual defence to the plaintiff’s contractual claim against the defendant for breach of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Third feature – use of the conditional verb “would” in paragraph 2</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The third feature of the 11 June letter on which the defendant relies is that the plaintiff used the conditional verb “would” in the phrase “All works that would affect the aesthetic uniformity / facade…” in paragraph 2 of the 11 June letter.

</div>
</div> It is true that “would” in paragraph 2, if interpreted as a conditional verb, denotes<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">a possibility</span> that the Works <span class="font-italic">might</span> affect the aesthetic uniformity or façade and therefore could be read as expressing a condition for the defendant to comply with. But “would” in this context is not necessarily interpreted as a conditional verb. It can also be interpreted as a modal verb. As a modal verb, “would” denotes a <span class="font-italic">determination</span> that the Works do affect the aesthetic uniformity of façade. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendant’s submission on the meaning of “would” is, in effect, a submission that the 11 June letter constitutes approval of the Works on 11 June 2011 subject to a condition subsequent to be tested at some point in the future on subjective grounds. That interpretation of the 11 June letter is incorrect for the reasons I have already given at [42]–[47] above. I therefore find the modal interpretation of “would” to be the correct interpretation of that word in paragraph 2. On that basis, paragraph 2 in fact conveys the plaintiff’s determination that the proposed Works “would” – used as a modal verb – affect the estate’s aesthetic uniformity or façade and therefore “are not permitted”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Fourth feature – renovation at main entrance</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The final feature on which the defendant relies is the fact that paragraph 2 of the 11 June letter also refers to the proposed renovations to the defendant’s main entrance door and the floor finishes fronting the door. Accepting the plaintiff’s submissions on the meaning of paragraph 2 means that the defendant’s renovations to her main entrance were also carried out in breach of the by-laws and must be reinstated. But the plaintiff has never taken that position.

</div> The plaintiff’s objections were eventually resolved. No evidence was adduced as to the reason for the objections. Equally, no evidence was adduced as to how the plaintiff’s objections were resolved. Did the plaintiff object regardless of aesthetic uniformity but simply because the renovations at the main entrance were carried out without prior written approval, contrary to the by-laws? Or did the plaintiff object because the renovations were duly approved but were carried out in a manner which failed to maintain aesthetic uniformity? Or did the plaintiff initially object because these renovations were carried out without prior written approval but then withdraw the objection because the renovations were presented as a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span> which maintained aesthetic uniformity or represented a <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> variation? Or did the plaintiff initially object because the renovations were carried out without prior written approval and withdraw the objection because the defendant carried out rectification or reinstatement works to maintain aesthetic uniformity? Given the lack of evidence on any of these points, and given the strength of the arguments I have set out at [42]–[47] above, the manner in which the plaintiff dealt with the defendant’s renovations to her main entrance does not advance the defendant’s case on the correct interpretation of the 11 June letter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the 11 June letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The meaning to be attributed to these four features raised by the defendant must thus be informed by the wider context of the 11 June letter. For the reasons I have set out above, an examination of the 11 June letter as a whole and in context reinforces my conclusion at [47] above that the correct interpretation of the 11 June letter is that the plaintiff denied approval for the Works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Works having been carried out in breach of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in contravention of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) and 3.0(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the defendant’s argument that the Works satisfy the condition subsequent in the 11 June letter – in that they do not “affect the aesthetic uniformity/façade” of the building – are immaterial to her liability for the breach. The Works were carried out without prior written approval in breach of the by-laws and therefore in breach of contract. It is not a defence to the breach to show that the Works do not qualitatively affect the aesthetic uniformity or the façade. This factor is, however, relevant to the issue of remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I should add that even if I had accepted the defendant’s submissions and found that the 11 June letter granted approval for the Works subject to the condition subsequent set out in paragraph 2, I would also have found that that condition subsequent was never satisfied. The Works do affect the aesthetic uniformity of The Arcadia’s façade in a manner which is more than <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. Even on her own case, therefore, I find that the defendant failed to satisfy the condition subsequent in the 11 June letter. On that ground too, I would have held that the defendant carried out the Works without prior written approval and was in breach of the by-laws.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The result is that the defendant is in breach of by-law 3.0(<span class="font-italic">n</span>)(iii) on any view of her case.

Therefore, a subsidiary proprietor will not breach s 37 of the Act if he obtains the management corporation’s oral approval for improvements which come within the ambit of s 37.

That is because s 37 is forward-looking: it imposes restrictions and conditions which bind a subsidiary proprietor <span class="font-italic">before</span> she effects any improvements to her lot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This second issue which I have to determine thus resolves into two sub-issues:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Do the Works affect “the appearance of any building comprised in the strata title plan” so as to engage s 37(3) of the Act?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) If so, did the plaintiff authorise the Works within the meaning of s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act?</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 37(3) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Determining whether renovations affect the appearance of a building is a factual exercise, undertaken by comparing the façade presented by the flat in question with the façade presented by other similar flats and by all of the flats as a whole: <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1786 v Huang Hsiang </span><span class="font-italic">Shui</span> [2006] SGDC 20 at [112].

</div> I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s photographs have been taken from positions which are not unfair to the defendant. The vantage points from which these photographs have been taken are practically possible or likely for a reasonable observer to occupy when looking at the defendant’s balcony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I thus find that the Works do affect the appearance of a building comprised in The Arcadia’s strata title plan within the meaning of s 37(3) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is not necessary to make a further finding that the Works detract from the appearance of a building in The Arcadia’s strata title plan at this stage of the inquiry. That test is no part of s 37(3) but appears only in s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). In defining the circumstances in which a subsidiary proprietor must get prior authorisation, s 37(3) uses the objective word “affect” rather than the subjective word “detract”. That word choice is deliberate. It ensures that a subsidiary proprietor cannot arrogate to herself a subjective decision on whether her improvements come within s 37(3) and whether she is obliged to seek and secure prior authorisation. The obligation arises whenever an improvement “affects” the appearance of any building in a strata title plan. That test is more objective than that which appears in s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). So long as the objective test in s 37(3) is satisfied, the subsidiary proprietor must seek and secure the management corporation’s approval. Whether the Works <span class="font-italic">detract</span> from the appearance of the building becomes relevant only when the management corporation considers whether to grant approval under s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant’s Works undoubtedly affect the appearance of the building.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I am prepared to accept Mr Ngo’s evidence that the plaintiff’s condominium manager gave the defendant oral approval to carry out the Works before the Works commenced. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s power to grant authorisation under s 37(4)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 But even if I were to accept that the plaintiff gave oral approval for the Works before the Works commenced, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that that approval would be of no legal effect because s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act does not empower the plaintiff to approve works which detract from the appearance of a building in its strata title plan. I first explain the limits on the plaintiff’s power to grant approval under s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) before turning to consider why the Works fell outside the ambit of the plaintiff’s powers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Limits on the power to grant approval under s 37(4)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Section 37(4) of the Act empowers a management corporation to authorise a subsidiary proprietor to effect improvements to her lot <span class="font-italic">if </span>the management corporation is satisfied that the statutory criteria in s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are met. The plain and ordinary meaning of s 37(4) is that a management corporation is <span class="font-italic">not</span> empowered to authorise improvements to a lot if the improvements <span class="font-italic">do not</span> meet the statutory criteria. This interpretation of s 37(4) accords with common sense. Parliament could not have intended to empower a management corporation to authorise renovations which would, for example, affect the structural integrity of a building contrary to s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The legislative history of s 37(4) also supports this interpretation. Section 37(4) of the Act is adapted from s 98(1) and (2) of the Condominium Act of Ontario, S O 1998, c 19 (Can) (“Ontario Condominium Act”): Teo Keang Sood, <span class="font-italic">Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia</span>”) at para 10.96. Section 98(2) of the Ontario Condominium Act governs renovations to common property over which subsidiary proprietors have exclusive use. To carry out such renovations, the management corporation must be satisfied that the renovation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) will not have an adverse effect on units owned by other owners;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) will not give rise to any expense to the corporation;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">will not detract from the appearance of buildings on the property</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">will not affect the structural integrity of buildings on the property</span> according to a certificate of an engineer, if the proposed addition, alteration or improvement involves a change to the structure of the buildings; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) will not contravene the declaration or any prescribed requirements.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A management corporation cannot authorise the works if these criteria are not fulfilled: <span class="font-italic">Metropolitan Toronto </span><span class="font-italic">Condominium Corp No 985 v Vanduzer </span>[2010] OJ No 571 at [25] and <span class="font-italic">Waterloo North Condominium Corp No 37 v </span><span class="font-italic">Silaschi </span>2012 ONSC 5403 at [13]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The decision whether the statutory criteria in s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) are met is within the purview of the management corporation and not the courts. This is apparent from s 37(4) itself, which requires that it is the management corporation who must be satisfied that both subsections are satisfied. Placing the decision-making in the hands of the management corporation is in line with the overall intention of parliament in enacting the Act. The Act repealed the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act (Cap 30, 2000 Rev Ed) (“BCPA”) and amended the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“LTSA”). At the time the Act was introduced, the number of strata flats and management corporations had increased significantly since the enactment of the BCPA and LTSA. The Act was thus intended to empower management corporations to make decisions in a bid to encourage self-regulation, as government intervention was no longer feasible: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 April 2004) vol 77 at col 2742–2744 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development). Indeed, similar concerns underlie the Ontario Condominium Act from which the Act was adapted. Thus, an Ontario court in <span class="font-italic">York Region Standard Condominium Corp No 1076 v Anjali Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] OJ No 488 said at [9]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not [the] function [of the] judge, however, to assess the aesthetics of the changes made … As Cusinato J said at paragraph 12: “It matters not … that the landscaping appears to be beautifully done, or that all other unit holders find it pleasing. Where the elected Board concludes that it is unacceptable … their word [i]s final …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This is not, of course, to endorse the tyranny of the majority. There are statutory safeguards to prevent minority oppression in management corporations just as there are safeguards to prevent minority oppression in commercial corporations. In particular, a subsidiary proprietor whose application under s 37(4) has been unreasonably refused can, by virtue of s 111(b) of the Act, apply to the Strata Titles Board for an order compelling the management corporation to give its consent for her intended improvement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Works fall outside the plaintiff’s powers of approval</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 For the reasons set out above at [42]–[47], I find that the plaintiff determined in the 11 June letter that the Works will and do affect the aesthetic uniformity and the façade of the building. That amounts to a determination that the Works detract from the appearance of the building and that the Works are not in keeping with the rest of the building. That suffices to render the Works contrary to both limbs of s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). That being so, the plaintiff was not empowered to authorise the Works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 That is the end of the defendant’s defence to the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant carried out the Works in breach of s 37(3) of the Act. Section 111(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act is not engaged in this application. The question of whether the plaintiff arrived at this determination reasonably does not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In any event, for what it is worth, I consider that the Works do detract from the appearance of the building or, at the very least, are not in keeping with the buildings in the Arcadia. The subsidiary proprietors in The Arcadia place paramount interest on maintaining aesthetic uniformity in their development. The plaintiff – who, after all, is simply the embodiment of the collective will of The Arcadia’s subsidiary proprietors – has passed by-laws which attach special significance to renovations carried out on a balcony. The plaintiff has also enacted specific by-laws to maintain day-to-day aesthetic uniformity of the balcony and therefore the façade, even to the extent of regulating the type, height and quantity of plants that can be grown in planter boxes on balconies

The result is that any oral approval which the condominium manager may have given to Mr Joseph Ngo before the defendant’s renovations commenced was not authorisation within the meaning of s 37(4).

</div> have all deposed that they understood the 11 June letter as conveying the plaintiff’s conditional approval for the Works. I do not doubt that the defendant understood the 11 June letter in that way. It seems unlikely to me that the defendant understood the 11 June letter as denying approval for the Works yet went ahead with the Works. The evidence is that the defendant carried out the Works openly and not surreptitiously. It seems highly unlikely that the defendant would have carried out the Works openly, knowing that the plaintiff had denied approval for them, in the hope that nobody would ever detect the unauthorised Works. The defendant could not have foreseen that the plaintiff and the other subsidiary proprietors would fail to detect the Works until long after they were completed. I find it unlikely that a subsidiary proprietor would run the significant risk in terms of time, cost and inconvenience of carrying out renovations which she knew had been denied approval.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 But the defendant’s understanding of the 11 June letter does not suffice in itself to establish an estoppel by convention. An estoppel by convention requires an assumption of fact or law which is communicated by one party to the other, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> which crosses the line between the parties. Even if the estoppel by convention is founded on an assumption on the defendant’s side and acquiescence on the plaintiff’s side, the plaintiff’s acquiescence must still arise from a common or shared assumption between the plaintiff and the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The crucial finding against an estoppel by convention is my finding that the plaintiff’s intent in writing the 11 June letter is contrary to the defendant’s understanding of the 11 June letter. The 11 June letter conveyed the plaintiff’s denial of approval for the Works. The defendant’s understanding that the plaintiff had approved the Works subject to a condition was therefore not an assumption which was shared by both parties or which was common to both parties. No estoppel by convention can arise by reason of that letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In addition, I do not consider that the plaintiff acquiesced in the defendant’s understanding of the 11 June letter in the sense necessary to give rise to an estoppel by convention. The defendant relies on the following acts of acquiescence by the plaintiff: (a) granting oral approval for the Works;

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 A common or shared assumption is essential even where a party seeks to establish an estoppel by convention arising from the other party’s acquiescence. As Lord Steyn said in <span class="font-italic">Republic of India v India Steam Ship Co</span> [1998] AC 878 at 913–914:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]n estoppel by convention may arise where parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or law, the assumption being either shared by them both or made by one and acquiesced in by the other. The effect of an estoppel by convention is to preclude a party from denying the assumed facts or law if it would be unjust to allow him to go back on the assumption … It is not enough that each of the two parties acts on an assumption not communicated to the other. But … a concluded agreement is not a requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It was never the plaintiff’s intent to grant approval for the Works subject to a condition subsequent. The acts of acquiescence relied upon by the defendant cannot support an estoppel by convention because I do not accept that the plaintiff at any time – before, during or after the Works – shared the defendant’s assumption that the Works had been approved subject to a condition subsequent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Should a mandatory injunction be granted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Where a subsidiary proprietor has breached a negative covenant, a mandatory injunction to redress the breach will ordinarily issue upon the application of the management corporation (<span class="font-italic">Chen Ee </span><span class="font-italic">Yueh Rachel</span>, <span class="font-italic">supra </span>[74],<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22]). The plaintiff is therefore <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to relief by way of a mandatory injunction, whether for its contractual claim under the by-laws or its statutory claim for breach of s 37(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Arising from the findings which I have made, the form of the injunction which one would expect to issue is a mandatory injunction compelling the defendant to carry out reinstatement works on her balcony unconditionally and with immediate effect. However, for the reasons which follow, I have declined to order an unconditional mandatory injunction with immediate effect. To be fair, the plaintiff did not press for a mandatory injunction in that form either. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chen Ee Yueh Rachel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In <span class="font-italic">Chen Ee </span><span class="font-italic">Yueh Rachel</span>, Chao Hick Tin J held that a mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a negative covenant may not issue if (<span class="font-italic">Chen Ee </span><span class="font-italic">Yueh Rachel </span>at [22]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the plaintiff’s own conduct would make it unjust to do so; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the breach is trivial or has caused no damage or no appreciable damage to the plaintiff and a mandatory injunction would impose substantial hardship on the defendant with no counterbalancing benefit to the plaintiff.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In that case, a subsidiary proprietor replaced the metal grilles on her balcony with sliding glass windows without prior written approval, contrary to the estate’s by-laws. The management corporation sought a mandatory injunction to compel reinstatement. Chao Hick Tin J declined to grant the injunction, holding that to do so would cause hardship to the subsidiary proprietor without any real corresponding benefit to the management corporation. This was because the uniformity sought by the management corporation could not be achieved. There were seven other flats which had carried out similar renovations to their balconies. And the management corporation could not do anything about the variation in the façade presented by those seven flats because they had carried out their renovations before the management corporation was established. The court noted that not granting the mandatory injunction in this case would not undermine the authority of the management corporation over other subsidiary proprietors who might be minded to replace their own grilles in the same way because their breach of a by-law attracted penal sanction under the legislation then in force, the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For reasons which I set out at [116] and [117] below, neither of the factors which weighed so heavily in <span class="font-italic">Che</span><span class="font-italic">n Ee Yueh Rachel </span>at [22] are present in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 For the reasons which follow, I do not consider that granting the plaintiff a mandatory injunction compelling reinstatement would be unjust on the facts of this case. I accept that granting the plaintiff a mandatory injunction which is unconditional and which has immediate effect could be said to be unjust. But that goes to the terms of the mandatory injunction and not to the fundamental question of whether one should issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I do not consider the defendant’s breach to be trivial and cannot say that it has caused no damage or no appreciable damage to the plaintiff. Nor can I say that a mandatory injunction would impose substantial hardship on the defendant with no counterbalancing benefit to the plaintiff. I say that for six reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 First, it remains the case that the plaintiff is in breach of both s 37(3) of the Act and of the contract with the plaintiff embodied in the plaintiff’s by-laws. It may be true that the defendant’s breach does not arise from fault on her part. But lack of fault is no defence to either the statutory claim or the contractual claim. Withholding a mandatory injunction on grounds of lack of fault would elevate absence of fault into a substantive defence. That would undermine the entire scheme of the Act and of the statutory contract constituted by the by-laws. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Second, on the defendant’s side of the balance, the only hardship which granting a mandatory injunction would impose on her is the financial hardship of the cost of reinstating the balcony. Financial hardship is insufficient hardship in itself for a court to withhold the remedy of a mandatory injunction where a breach is established: <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 681 v Tan Yew Huat</span> [2015] SGDC 118 at [29(a)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Third, on the plaintiff’s side of the balance, I have found that the variance in the façade presented by the defendant’s balcony is not <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> and does detract from the aesthetics and the uniformity of the façade of The Arcadia as a whole. I accept that aesthetic uniformity is of paramount concern to the subsidiary proprietors in The Arcadia. They have manifested this concern generally through the plaintiff’s by-laws (see [91] above). They have also manifested this concern specifically in the context of this case by the unanimous resolution passed at the 32nd Annual General Meeting in 2017 (see [18] above). They have followed through on the resolution with every one of the five strata title lots which have caused a variance in the façade. The plaintiff is not pursuing the defendant capriciously or arbitrarily. It has a legitimate interest in doing so and is treating the affected subsidiary proprietors equally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116  Fourth, unlike <span class="font-italic">Chen Ee </span><span class="font-italic">Yueh Rachel</span>, it remains possible to achieve aesthetic uniformity in The Arcadia. Although there are four other flats in The Arcadia in which similar balcony works have been carried out, the subsidiary proprietors of these four flats have entered into settlement agreements with the defendant. In those settlements, they have agreed, subject to certain conditions and a long-stop date of 1 December 2021, to reinstate their balconies to the original design.

</div>
</div> The findings I have made suggest no reason why the defendant should be treated any differently from the other four subsidiary proprietors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Fifth, refusing to issue a mandatory injunction against the defendant will, once the other four flats have carried out reinstatement works, only serve to make the defendant’s variance more prominent and the detraction from aesthetic uniformity even more pronounced. It is recognised that that can have an impact on values of flats in a development. The plaintiff has a clear interest in avoiding that result, both aesthetically and economically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Sixth, declining to grant a mandatory injunction in this case will undermine the plaintiff’s authority to ensure aesthetic uniformity. The penal sanction which served as a backstop to the management corporation’s authority in <span class="font-italic">Chen Ee </span><span class="font-italic">Yueh Rachel</span> no longer exists. It was removed from the Act with the objective of “reducing Government intervention and enhancing self-regulation [by management corporations]” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 April 2004) vol 77 at col 2747 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development)). Under the self-regulating regime introduced by the Act, a mandatory injunction compelling reinstatement is all the more necessary in order to avoid a free-for-all amongst subsidiary proprietors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For all of these reasons I have decided that a mandatory injunction must issue against the defendant, albeit not one which is unconditional or which will take effect immediately. In deferring the effect of the mandatory injunction, I bear in mind two factors. First, the result of the plaintiff’s settlement agreements with the other subsidiary proprietors who are in the same position as the defendant means that there is no assurance of aesthetic uniformity being restored in The Arcadia before 1 December 2021. Second, even though I have found the detraction caused by the Works to be real and beyond <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>, the long period of time which the defendant’s neighbours took to detect the variance in the defendant’s balcony and which the plaintiff took to press the defendant on it indicates to me that the Works will not detract <span class="font-italic">significantly</span> from the aesthetics or the uniformity of the façade at The Arcadia before 1 December 2021. Both those factors suggest that an unconditional and immediate injunction is not warranted in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 For all of these reasons, I have directed that a mandatory injunction shall issue against the defendant but in terms no more onerous on the defendant than the terms of the settlements which the plaintiff has reached with each of the other four subsidiary proprietors in the same position as the defendant. The mandatory injunction that will issue will therefore require the defendant to carry out the necessary rectification and reinstatement works at her own cost and expense upon the occurrence of any one of the following events, whichever occurs first:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) when the defendant undertakes renovations works (that do not constitute “Minor Renovation Works” as defined under cl 4.5 of The Arcadia’s by-laws dated 5 July 2013) to her flat, she shall at the same time carry out the rectification and reinstatement; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) when the defendant sells or transfers the flat, she shall upon the execution of the option to purchase or agreement of sale or transfer:</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) give written notice to the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) procure and carry out, at her own cost and expense, the rectification and reinstatement; and</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) complete the rectification and reinstatement prior to the completion of the sale or transfer of the flat; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) when the plaintiff receives written notice from any subsidiary proprietor(s) or occupier(s) regarding the unauthorised works carried out by the defendant, and the said subsidiary proprietor(s) or occupier(s) requisitions a motion that the defendant carries out the rectification and reinstatement works, and the said motion is duly passed at a general meeting, she shall carry out the rectification and reinstatement; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) on the expiration of the longstop deadline set as 1 December 2021.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Given that the entire purpose of reinstatement is aesthetics and appearances rather than substance, I have also ordered the plaintiff to extend to the defendant the benefit – to the extent that the defendant is able to avail itself of that benefit – of an addendum which the plaintiff has agreed in the settlement agreement with one set of subsidiary proprietors. The addendum is to the following effect:
