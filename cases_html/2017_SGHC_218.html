The court held that it had no jurisdiction under the Administration of Justice Act 1956 (c 46) (UK) (“AJA 1956”) to arrest ships for this purpose. Brandon J reasoned as follows (at 547):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Section 3(4) of the AJA 1956] provides that the Admiralty jurisdiction may be invoked by an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, and the jurisdiction referred to is the jurisdiction to hear and determine various types of claim as set out in [s 1(1) of the AJA 1956]. It is to be inferred from that that the object of the process <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> is to provide security for a plaintiff in respect of any judgment which he may obtain as the result of the hearing and determination of a claim. That is the purpose of proceedings <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> and, subject to the point I made, that it covers also payment of a sum due under a settlement in an action, it is the sole purpose of such process … In my view the court … only has jurisdiction to arrest ships and keep ships under arrest for the purpose of providing security for a judgment of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Sections 1(1) and 3(4) of the AJA 1956 are, for all intents and purposes, identical to ss 3(1) and 4(4) of the Act respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Brandon J found reinforcement for his view in the fact that under the Rules of the Supreme Court that were in force then, bail “must be given by bond in Form No. 11” and Form No. 11 covered only a judgment in the action or a sum payable by virtue of a settlement of the action (at 547–548). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he “Vasso” (formerly “Andria”)</span> [1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 235 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasso</span>”), the English Court of Appeal disagreed with Brandon J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">The Cap Bon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>although the end result was the same. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the plaintiff’s purpose in invoking the court’s admiralty jurisdiction did not affect the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of the court’s jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act 1981 (c 54) (UK) (“SCA 1981”), but only the court’s <span class="font-italic">exercise</span> of its jurisdiction. Goff LJ stated as follows (at 241):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]e find ourselves unable to agree with [Brandon J’s] view that the Court has no <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to arrest a ship, or to maintain an arrest, where the purpose of the plaintiff is simply to obtain security for an award in arbitration proceedings. We are ourselves unable to conceive of a case where the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the purpose of the plaintiff invoking the Court’s jurisdiction. Generally speaking, the word “jurisdiction” simply expresses a power of the Court – in such cases as the present, the power of the Court – to “hear and determine”, i.e. to adjudicate upon, certain types of claim. These types of claim are set out in the lettered sub-paragraphs of what used to be s 1(1) of the [AJA 1956] (now s. 20(2) of the [SCA 1981]): and, as appears from s 3(4) of the [AJA 1956] (now s.  21(4) of the [SCA 1981]) that jurisdiction may be invoked by an action in rem in the case of some, though not all, of those types of claim. Of course, where the court’s jurisdiction may be invoked by an action in rem, the Court must have the power to arrest …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the purpose of the plaintiff in invoking the Admiralty jurisdiction cannot affect the existence of the jurisdiction. The jurisdiction is simply there. The Court has power to arrest. But the exercise of the power is, as O. 75 r. 5(1) [of the Rules of the Supreme Court] shows, not mandatory; the Court may decline to exercise it … The Court’s decision whether to exercise [this power] may be affected by the manner in which, or the purpose for which, the plaintiff has proceeded …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Goff LJ then went on to hold (at 242) that the court’s jurisdiction to arrest a ship in an action in rem should only be exercised to provide security in respect of <span class="font-italic">th</span><span class="font-italic">e action in rem, and not any other proceedings</span>. Accordingly, the court held that it should not issue a warrant of arrest if its jurisdiction was invoked to obtain the arrest of a ship as security for an award in arbitration. As noted in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasso</span> (at 242), s 26 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (c 27) (UK) (“CJJA 1982”) had not yet been brought into force then. Section 26 of the CJJA 1982 changed the law in the United Kingdom and this is discussed later at [28] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 <span class="font-italic">The Vasso</span> was cited with approval by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“ICL Raja Mahendra”</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 922. The issue there was whether a plaintiff, having arrested a vessel in Singapore, may obtain alternative security to cover a judgment or an award in any other jurisdiction (in exchange for the release of the arrested vessel) apart from the provisions under ss 6 and 7 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 1995 Rev Ed) (“IAA 1995”). For present purposes those provisions do not differ materially from their equivalents in the current version of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). The High Court held (at [22]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[t]he purpose of invoking the court’s jurisdiction in the first instance and the reason for the application for stay are relevant considerations to the court in the exercise of its discretion to release the arrested vessel. I agree that the court’s jurisdiction to arrest a ship in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> should not be exercised for the purpose of providing security for an award or judgment elsewhere. An exception is where a party applies under s 6 of the [IAA 1995] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In response to the above cases, the plaintiff referred me to <span class="font-italic">Avin</span><span class="font-italic"> International Bunkers Supply SA v The Owners of the Ship or Vessel “United Endurance”</span>, Admiralty in Rem No 108 of 2007 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">United Endurance</span>”). That case involved a dispute over the specifications of fuel oil supplied by the plaintiff (“Avin”) to the vessel. Avin commenced an action in the First Instance Court of Piraeus, Greece, against the owner of the vessel (“Trade Tankers”) and filed an application for the arrest of the vessel. Avin obtained a temporary order for the arrest of the vessel. The vessel was released after Trade Tankers provided a bank guarantee to secure Avin’s claim. Trade Tankers filed a claim for damages suffered due to the supply of off-specifications fuel oil and applied to the same court for an interim attachment of Avin’s assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Both Avin’s and Trade Tankers’ applications were heard by the First Instance Court of Piraeus. The court disallowed Avin’s application. It decided that (a) it was not likely that Trade Tankers would sell the vessel or fail to pay if Avin succeeded in its claim, and (b) security was not necessary as Trade Tankers’ claim exceeded Avin’s claim. The court allowed Trade Tankers’ application and ordered Avin to provide security for Trade Tankers’ claim. Avin provided a bank guarantee and the attachment on its assets was lifted. The bank guarantee provided by Trade Tankers to secure Avin’s claim was discharged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Pending the hearing of the substantive claims in Greece, Avin learned that Trade Tankers had put up the vessel (which was the only vessel owned by it) for sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 When the vessel subsequently entered Singapore port limits, Avin commenced action in Admiralty in Rem No 108 of 2007 in Singapore and arrested the vessel. Trade Tankers furnished security by way of a bank guarantee and the vessel was released. The guarantee was wide enough to cover judgment sums that might be awarded in the proceedings in Greece. Avin filed an application to stay the action in favour of the proceedings in Greece. Trade Tankers filed an application to, among other things, dismiss the plaintiff’s action, set aside the warrant of arrest and discharge the guarantee. The Assistant Registrar granted Avin’s application for a stay as it was common ground that Greece was the more appropriate forum. She dismissed Trade Tankers’ application to dismiss the action and to set aside the warrant of arrest. However, she ordered that the security furnished by Trade Tankers be discharged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Trade Tankers appealed against the dismissal of its application. One of the arguments made by Trade Tankers in support of its appeal before the High Court was that the court had no jurisdiction to arrest a ship in an action in rem for the purpose of providing security for a judgment in a foreign court. Avin took issue with Trade Tankers’ argument and appealed against the order discharging the security furnished by Trade Tankers. The High Court dismissed Trade Tankers’ appeal and allowed Avin’s appeal. The result was that the bank guarantee furnished by Trade Tankers continued to be maintained as security for the proceedings in Greece.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 No grounds of decision were issued in <span class="font-italic">The United Endurance. </span>In the present case, the plaintiff submitted that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">United Endurance</span> must have disagreed with <span class="font-italic">The ICL Raja </span><span class="font-italic">Mahendra </span>and decided that a vessel could be arrested to provide security for proceedings in a foreign court. However, in my view, <span class="font-italic">The United Endurance </span>offered limited guidance since I did not have the benefit of the learned judge’s reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In any event, I agreed with <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasso </span>and <span class="font-italic">The ICL Raja </span><span class="font-italic">Mahendra</span> and concluded that the power of arrest in an action in rem<span class="font-italic"> </span>should not be exercised in aid of legal proceedings in a foreign court.<span class="font-italic"> </span>First, as stated in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Vasso </span>(at 242), the purpose of the arrest in an action in rem is to provide security in respect of <span class="font-italic">th</span><span class="font-italic">e action in rem</span>. In my respectful view, this must be correct. After all, an action in rem is a mode of exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by s 3(1) of the Act and that jurisdiction is to “hear and determine”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>to adjudicate upon, those questions and claims set out in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">r</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, this conclusion was reinforced by the fact that (similar to what Brandon J had noted in <span class="font-italic">The Cap Bon</span>) pursuant to O 70 r 15(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), bail “must be given by bond in Form 168” and Form 168 covers only a judgment in the action or a sum payable by virtue of a settlement of the action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, this conclusion was also supported by the fact that legislative intervention was required to give the court power, when staying proceedings in court pending arbitration, to order that “property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any award made on the arbitration”. Section 7(1) of the IAA, which gives the court such power, had been enacted in 1994 following a recommendation by the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law that “specific provision be made to allow ships arrested under the High Court’s admiralty jurisdiction to be used as security for pending international arbitrations” (Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report of the </span><span class="font-italic">Sub-Committee on Review of Arbitration Laws </span>(August 1993) at paras 48–49 (Chairman: Giam Chin Toon))<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In contrast, there is no statutory provision that empowers the Singapore courts to order that property arrested be retained for the satisfaction of a judgment given in foreign court proceedings. This differs from the position in the United Kingdom where the court’s powers are clearly wider. In addition to s 11(1) of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (which is substantially similar to s 7(1) of the IAA), s 26(1) of the CJJA 1982 further provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26.—(1) Where in England and Wales or Northern Ireland a court stays or dismisses Admiralty proceedings on the ground that the dispute in question should be submitted <span class="font-italic">to the determination of the courts </span>of another part of the United Kingdom or <span class="font-italic">of an overseas country</span>, the court may, if in those proceedings property has been arrested or bail or other security has been given to prevent or obtain release from arrest –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) order that the property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any award or judgment which –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) is given in respect of the dispute in the legal proceedings in favour of which those proceedings are stayed or dismissed; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) is enforceable in England and Wales or, as the case may be, in Northern Ireland; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) order that the stay or dismissal of those proceedings be conditional on the provision of equivalent security for the satisfaction of any such award or judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, in Singapore, legislative intervention would be required if the court is to be given powers to order that property arrested in an action in rem in Singapore be retained as security for the satisfaction of a judgment given in legal proceedings in a foreign court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Since the power of arrest in an action in rem should not be exercised in aid of legal proceedings in a foreign court, in my view, it followed that the plaintiff’s action in rem was an abuse of process since it was commenced for the sole purpose of arresting the Vessel to obtain security in aid of the London proceedings. Accordingly, I struck out the writ of summons and set aside the warrant of arrest against the Vessel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiff next submitted that the court has ordered security for foreign proceedings as a condition for the stay of Singapore proceedings. The plaintiff argued that in the present case, the court should similarly order the Singapore proceedings to be stayed and the security furnished by the defendant to remain in force. The plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf”</span> [2012] 2 SLR 289 and <span class="font-italic">The “Asian </span><span class="font-italic">Plutus”</span> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 504.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 <span class="font-italic">The Reecon Wolf</span> involved a collision between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s vessels. The defendant brought an action in Malaysia and arrested the plaintiff’s vessel. The plaintiff brought an action in Singapore and arrested the defendant’s vessel. The defendant then applied to stay the Singapore proceedings on the basis that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum for the dispute to be heard. The court agreed with the defendant and ordered a stay of the Singapore proceedings on condition that the defendant provided the plaintiff with security to answer any judgment which the plaintiff may obtain against the defendant in Malaysia (at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">The Asian </span><span class="font-italic">Plutus</span>, the plaintiff sued the defendant for damage to cargo discharged in Singapore. The cargo was shipped under a bill of lading which provided that any action against the carrier was to be brought in the Tokyo District Court. The defendant applied to stay the Singapore proceedings in favour of proceedings in the Tokyo District Court. The Registrar who heard the stay application ordered a stay on the condition that, among other things, the defendant provided security for the plaintiff’s action to be brought in the Tokyo District Court (at [4]). The High Court affirmed the Registrar’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I disagreed with the plaintiff’s submission. In my view, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>and <span class="font-italic">The Asian </span><span class="font-italic">Plutus</span> did not assist the plaintiff. In both <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>and<span class="font-italic"> The Asian </span><span class="font-italic">Plutus</span>, the plaintiff wanted to proceed with the proceedings in Singapore. The issue before the court in each case was whether the proceedings in Singapore should be stayed in favour of a foreign jurisdiction. The provision of security was imposed as a condition to the order staying the proceedings in Singapore. Neither case involved an application to strike out the Singapore proceedings. In contrast, in the present case, the defendant had applied to strike out the action. Although the plaintiff did file an application to stay the action in Singapore, that application became irrelevant once I decided to strike out the action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether damages should be awarded for wrongful arrest or wrongful continuance of arrest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendant asked for damages for wrongful arrest or wrongful continuance of arrest of the Vessel. The legal principles are not in dispute. To succeed in a claim for damages for wrongful arrest, the defendant must show that there was bad faith or malicious negligence on the part on the plaintiff in bringing the action or in rejecting any security offered for release of the vessel. The same test is applied to determine whether there was wrongful continuance of an arrest. See <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Kiku Pacific </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 91 at [14]–[17] and <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Evmar</span> at [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The defendant submitted that the following demonstrated bad faith on the plaintiff’s part:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff pursued the arrest of the Vessel for the purpose of providing security in foreign court proceedings, in blatant disregard of Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff failed to act expeditiously in providing the security quantum and/or in responding to the wording of the undertaking to be provided as security, and such delay was an attempt to extract favourable terms in the London proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my view, the law was not so settled that the plaintiff could be said to have proceeded with the arrest of the Vessel in bad faith. It was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to rely on the decision in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">United Endurance</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the alleged delay, I disagreed with the defendant that the plaintiff had dealt with security negotiations in such a dilatory manner as to amount to bad faith. I accepted the plaintiff’s explanations that (a) it had to take instructions from solicitors in London, who in turn had to take instructions from the plaintiff in Dubai, and (b) the conditions which the plaintiff had sought to impose on the defendant were part and parcel of legitimate commercial negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the plaintiff’s behaviour taken as a whole was reasonable and did not amount to bad faith or malice. I therefore did not award damages for wrongful arrest or wrongful continuation of arrest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For the foregoing reasons I allowed both appeals. I dismissed the plaintiff’s application for a stay of proceedings and for the maintenance of security pending the final determination of the London proceedings. I ordered that the writ be struck out, the warrant of arrest be set aside, and that the letter of undertaking issued by the American P&amp;I Association be returned to the defendant or their solicitors for cancellation forthwith. I declined to order damages for wrongful arrest or wrongful continuance of arrest of the Vessel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, I ordered the plaintiff to pay costs here and below, for both appeals, fixed at $16,500 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat, Dafril Phua and Christopher Yee (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Leong Kah Wah and Lim Ruo Lin (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
