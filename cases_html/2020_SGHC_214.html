The plaintiff, Mr Ng Tang Hock, holds 50% of the shares in Teelek Realty. The second defendant, Mdm Chew Kar Lay (“Wendy”), the third defendant, Ms Ng Pei Ling Shirlyn (“Shirlyn”) and the fourth defendant, Ng Jin Ping Eugene (“Eugene”), together hold the remaining 50% of the shares in Teelek Realty. Wendy was married to the plaintiff; they divorced in 2012. Shirlyn and Eugene are their children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff’s main claims were against Teelek Realty for the repayment of loans, and against Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene for oppression in relation to the affairs of Teelek Realty. In their counterclaims, Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene claimed that the plaintiff held his shares in Teelek Realty on trust for Shirlyn and Eugene in equal shares and sought the transfer of those shares to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Although I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against Teelek Realty for the repayment of loans, I found largely in favour of the plaintiff in respect of his other claims. In particular, I found that he had succeeded in his oppression claim and I ordered that Teelek Realty be wound up. I dismissed the counterclaims by Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene. All four defendants have appealed against my decision save for those parts of my decision where I made findings against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiff is a successful self-made businessman. His first wife passed away in 1989, leaving behind two children, Ng Jin Xiang Kevin (“Kevin”) who was born in 1986 and Ng Pei Xia Jeanette (“Jeanette”) who was born in 1988. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiff came to know Wendy in 1989 and she was employed as an accounts assistant in two of the plaintiff’s then companies, Ti-Lek Trading and Ti-Lek Petroleum Pte Ltd, in 1990. The former was in the business of ship-chandling and the latter owned a tanker vessel used for the supply of oil to Thai fishing vessels. The plaintiff was the owner of both companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiff and Wendy started a relationship in 1990 and Shirlyn was born in 1993, followed by Eugene in 1995. The plaintiff and Wendy were married on 21 June 1995, after Eugene was born.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Teelek Realty was incorporated in Singapore on 22 May 1996 as an investment holding company. It holds commercial and residential properties. At inception, the plaintiff and Wendy each held 50% of the shares in the company and both were also directors of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The plaintiff’s businesses were successful and grew over time, eventually comprising two groups of companies. The first was a group of 12 Panamian companies that owned a total of 12 oil tankers (“the Panama Companies”). The second was a group of companies that supported the operations of the oil tankers (“the Teelek Companies”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiff alleged that sometime in March 2006, he discovered that Wendy had a relationship with another man (one “Eric”) and woman (one “Carol”), each of whom had his/her own spouse. Wendy denied this; according to her, Eric and Carol were having an affair with each other only. The plaintiff claimed that he forgave Wendy for the sake of the children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In any event, the marriage did not work out and sometime in 2011, the plaintiff and Wendy started to talk about divorce and the division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 11 September 2011, Wendy left the matrimonial home with Shirlyn and Eugene.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The plaintiff and Wendy then effected the division of some of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 13 September 2011, the plaintiff transferred his shares in a company called Mingsen Link Limited (“Mingsen”) to Wendy and ceased to be a director of Mingsen. The plaintiff described Mingsen as the ‘cash cow’ of the bulk of the entire revenue earned from [his] offshore shipping operations”.

The plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Chuan &amp; Company Pte Ltd v Ong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Huat</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Chuan &amp; Co</span>”) in which the Court of Appeal held (at [17]) that “if an affidavit, though by its terms not addressed to the creditor, is nevertheless sent by the debtor to the creditor, that could amount to an effective acknowledgment of the debt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I disagreed with the plaintiff.

An acknowledgment of debt must stem from a voluntary desire to admit such a debt: <span class="font-italic">Murakami Takako</span><span class="font-italic"> (executrix of the estate of Takashi Murakami Suroso, deceased) v Wiryadi Louise Maria and others</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 565 (“<span class="font-italic">Murakami</span>”) at [36]. Disclosure of the general ledger, accompanied by an affidavit verifying the List of Documents, was part of the discovery process mandated by the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). It was as much a disclosure by compulsion as one made pursuant to an order of court. Such a disclosure did not embody the intention to convey the contents of the general ledger to the plaintiff. Neither did it stem from a voluntary desire to admit the debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, a document which refers to the alleged debt for the sake of denying its validity cannot be a good acknowledgment: Andrew McGee, <span class="font-italic">Limitation Periods</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2018) at paras 18.027–18.028; <span class="font-italic">Murakami </span>at [36]–[38], citing <span class="font-italic">In re Flynn, </span><span class="font-italic">decd (No 2)</span> [1969] 2 Ch 403. It could not be disputed that in the present action, Teelek Realty had denied liability for the Loans.

The references to the Loans in Wendy’s AEIC and SAEIC were simply part of her evidence in denying Teelek Realty’s liability. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff had waived the Loans in favour of Wendy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On 1 October 2011, the Loans were reclassified in Teelek Realty’s ledgers as loans owing by Teelek Realty to Wendy, instead of to the plaintiff.

This argument did not excuse Wendy’s non-compliance with the Articles.

</div> I disagreed with the plaintiff. Resolution 6 merely concerned a general authority to allot and issue shares at prices and upon terms to be decided. In my view, the plaintiff’s complaints were premature. In any event, the plaintiff would have been entitled to subscribe for any new shares to be issued, in proportion to his existing shareholding. There was no suggestion or evidence that the plaintiff would not have been financially able to do so. There was therefore no basis for the plaintiff’s submission that Resolution 6 was for the purpose of diluting his interest in Teelek Realty. In my view, Wendy’s attempt to have Resolution 6 passed did not amount to oppressive conduct within s 216 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 However, although Resolution 6 was eventually not proceeded with,  Wendy’s conduct in connection with Resolution 6 remained a relevant consideration. When the plaintiff objected to Resolution 6, she insisted on proceeding with it even though doing so contravened article 60 of Teelek Realty’s Articles. This was in clear disregard of the plaintiff’s interest as a shareholder and in breach of Wendy’s duties as a director. Wendy removed Resolution 6 from the agenda only because she was compelled to do so by the order that I made on 6 October 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In her oral testimony, Wendy explained that Resolution 6 had been included in the agenda by Teelek Realty’s corporate secretarial firm without her knowledge because she had told them that she wanted to transfer her shares to Shirlyn and Eugene.

</div> These deposits and withdrawals took place between 9 September 2015 and 13 July 2017. A total amount of $1.4m was deposited into Teelek Realty’s account; a matching total amount was withdrawn. The withdrawals were usually made on the same day as the deposits but on three occasions, the deposits were made within two days after the withdrawals. There was no suggestion or evidence that the deposits were meant for Teelek Realty. These deposits and withdrawals seemed to be loans to Teelek Realty and withdrawals in repayment of the loans. Although these deposits and withdrawals were not recorded in Teelek Realty’s general ledger, Wendy could not be said to have used Teelek Realty’s funds by making the withdrawals amounting to $1.4m.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Nonetheless, I agreed with the plaintiff that Wendy had co-mingled her funds with Teelek Realty’s funds and had treated Teelek Realty as her alter ego. It was not disputed that Wendy used Teelek Realty’s bank accounts as conduits for her other businesses. The moneys that were paid into Teelek Realty’s accounts were neither intended for Teelek Realty nor used for its purposes. Instead, they were withdrawn and used for Wendy’s own purposes or for purposes of the JCWC entities. I agreed with the plaintiff that such use of Teelek Realty’s accounts could not be said to be in the interests of Teelek Realty. Clearly, Wendy was treating Teelek Realty’s bank accounts as her own. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Wendy argued that Teelek Realty had suffered no loss.

</div> However, in so doing, they had ignored, and therefore breached, their duties as directors – in particular, their duties to act in Teelek Realty’s interests and to act with due care and diligence in executing their responsibilities as directors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the plaintiff’s oppression claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Section 216(1) of the Companies Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">216.</span>—(1) Any member or holder of a debenture of a company or, in the case of a declared company under Part IX, the Minister may apply to the Court for an order under this section on the ground — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members or holders of debentures including himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members, shareholders or holders of debentures of the company; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that some act of the company has been done or is threatened or that some resolution of the members, holders of debentures or any class of them has been passed or is proposed which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the members or holders of debentures (including himself).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 It is well established that s 216 of the Companies Act should not be used to vindicate wrongs which are in substance wrongs committed against the company, and which are thus corporate rather than personal in nature: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”) at [93]. A claim brought under s 216 in respect of corporate wrongs would be an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In the present case, Wendy had breached her duties as a director by reason of the matters set out at [96] above. As for Shirlyn and Eugene, they had breached their duties as directors because they had acted without due care and diligence and in disregard of the plaintiff’s interests as a shareholder. Breach of a director’s duty is a corporate wrong done to the company. However, it could not be denied that the transfer of shares to Shirlyn and Eugene, the failure to hold physical AGMs, and the failure to provide the plaintiff with the audited accounts within a reasonable time before the 20th AGM, (see [96(b)]–[96(d)] above) were also personal wrongs against the plaintiff as a shareholder of Teelek Realty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>, the Court of Appeal set out an analytical framework to be applied where an oppression action features both personal wrongs and corporate wrongs (at [115]–[116]). The key question is whether a plaintiff who brings an oppression action under s 216, instead of seeking leave to commence a statutory derivative action under s 216A, is abusing the process. In answering this question, the court is to consider the remedy sought, and the injury complained of and for which the remedy is sought. The appropriate analytical framework is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Injury</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Remedy</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) What is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [115]–[116].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong </span>framework, I was of the view that the plaintiff’s s 216 claim was not an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The real injury that the plaintiff sought to vindicate was injury to his interests as a shareholder of Teelek Realty and breach of his legitimate expectations as to how the company’s affairs were to be managed. Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene had ignored and disregarded the plaintiff’s interests as a shareholder. The injury to the plaintiff’s interests as a shareholder amounted to a distinct personal wrong and met the threshold of commercial unfairness.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The essential remedy sought by the plaintiff was an exit through a buyout order, which was a remedy only available under s 216. The plaintiff had also sought a restitutionary order in respect of the sum of $12,564,000 that Wendy had withdrawn in purported repayment of the reclassified loans. However, in the context of the s 216 claim, the restitutionary relief was incidental to the essential remedy sought – the restitutionary order was necessary in so far as it ensured a fair exit value for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Turning next to the test applicable under s 216, the four alternative limbs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, oppression, disregard of a member’s interests, unfair discrimination, or otherwise prejudicial conduct) under s 216(1) of the Companies Act are not to be read disjunctively. The common element is that of unfairness: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Over &amp; Over Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2010] 2 SLR 776</span> (“<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Over &amp; Over</span>”) at [70]. The common test is that of “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect”: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Over &amp; Over</span> at [77]. Ultimately, whether the test is satisfied depends on the facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my view, Wendy’s, Shirlyn’s and Eugene’s conduct clearly met the test of “unfairness” or “a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I therefore found for the plaintiff on his oppression claim. The plaintiff sought a buyout order in his favour but subject to terms, including a term that Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene give certain undertakings as to the financial status of Teelek Realty, and a special audit into the accounts and affairs of Teelek Realty. Clearly, the plaintiff had no confidence in the accuracy of Teelek Realty’s financial records. This was consistent with the evidence which showed that it was doubtful whether Wendy had kept Teelek Realty’s accounts properly. She had wrongfully reclassified the Loans and failed to record deposits into and withdrawals from Teelek Realty’s account (see [49] and [91] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the circumstances, I concluded that the more appropriate remedy was to wind up Teelek Realty rather than to make a buyout order, and I so ordered. The liquidators would be in a position to investigate the accounts and affairs of Teelek Realty. I also took into consideration the fact that Teelek Realty was just an investment holding company; it had no business operations in respect of which a winding-up order may not have been the most appropriate remedy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Restitutionary order against Wendy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In connection with his s 216 claim, the plaintiff also sought an order requiring Wendy to return the sum of $12,564,000 to Teelek Realty. Where the s 216 claim has been established, the court has a wide discretion to fashion such relief as it considers just, including making orders for the errant shareholders or directors of the company concerned to make restitution to the company of moneys that they have wrongfully diverted from the company: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([99] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [118]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I therefore ordered Wendy to return the sum of $12,564,000 to Teelek Realty and directed that Teelek Realty’s accounts be rectified accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s claim for conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The plaintiff claimed that Wendy, Shirlyn and Eugene conspired to injure himself and/or Teelek Realty by lawful and/or unlawful means.

</div> Although Wendy was not the beneficiary of the plaintiff’s shares in Teelek Realty under the alleged Trust Agreement, there was every reason to include the alleged Trust Agreement in the Ancillaries Order, had the agreement been made. After all, the plaintiff had allegedly agreed with Wendy on the disposal of his shares in Teelek Realty, which was a matrimonial asset. In addition, the plaintiff had allegedly agreed to give up control of Teelek Realty. This must have been important to Wendy since the plaintiff remained a 50% shareholder and would retain shareholder’s rights pending the transfer of his shares to Shirlyn and Eugene. In her closing submissions, Wendy also pointed out that the Ancillaries Order did not deal with the Pantech Properties or the Arcade Property.

Shirlyn and Eugene pleaded that, relying on the plaintiff’s representation, they were appointed as directors and had become shareholders in Teelek Realty.

</div> However, the evidence showed that their appointment as directors and their becoming shareholders were clearly neither in reliance on the plaintiff’s alleged representation nor to their detriment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Shirlyn was made a director in August 2012 when the plaintiff resigned as a director of Teelek Realty. Eugene became a director in September 2014 after he had attained the age of 18 years. Wendy testified that it was “always the intention of the plaintiff and [herself]” that both Shirlyn and Eugene would be appointed as directors of Teelek Realty once they attained the age of 18 years.
