They spent approximately two hours taking out and sorting through the items from the boxes.

This is because a formal complaint or accusation against Parti of having committed an offence (such as through the lodging of a police report) would jeopardise the possibility of her future employment in Singapore.

</div> For a foreign migrant worker such as Parti, any documentary complaint or accusation of committing an offence (such as a police report) could seriously jeopardise any possibility of Parti’s future employment. This, the Defence submits, prevents Parti from pursuing a complaint with a former employer since she is without a job.

</div> It is significant that at some time <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to her termination, Parti had expressed unhappiness for being made to do additional cleaning work at Karl’s home in 39 CL and at his office, probably without adequate compensation. It demonstrates Parti’s prior unhappiness in relation to such an arrangement, which was illegal and an offence against the MOM regulations. One must bear in mind that expressly stating that she would complain to MOM about this illegal work would most likely have meant that Parti would immediately lose her job and hence she might have been in a dilemma as to whether she should make such a complaint or even tell the Liew family that she intended to do so should she be made to continue doing cleaning work outside of 49 CL. Nevertheless, it appears that Parti had given hints to the Liew family that she ought not to be doing cleaning work elsewhere beyond 49 CL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my judgment, there is reason to believe that the Liew family, upon realising her unhappiness, took the pre-emptive first step to terminate her employment suddenly without giving her sufficient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a complaint to MOM. Once she made express her desire to complain to MOM after her sudden termination on 28 October 2016, the Liew family followed up with the police report to ensure her return would be prevented. In my view, the Liew family might not have made a police report had Parti not made her <span class="font-italic">express</span> threat on 28 October 2016 to report the matter to MOM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I observe that no evidence was adduced of any new items that were recently discovered to be missing <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the period around 28 October 2016, which necessitated the immediate and sudden termination of Parti by the Liew family during the period when Mr Liew was overseas. Instead, Mr Liew’s decision for Parti’s sudden termination was based on items that went missing “over the years”. In my view, this is not believable and it is more likely that the fear of Parti’s complaint to MOM rendered her termination urgent, at least in the eyes of the Liew family.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Further, I note that after Parti’s termination, Mr Liew returned to Singapore from abroad on the night of 29 October 2016

</div> In the First Information Report (“FIR”) dated 30 October 2016, Mr Liew identified the allegedly stolen items found in the three jumbo boxes, including hard disks worth $500, towels worth $100, gadgets worth $1,000.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-fcc802ba-fe8c-45ba-8473-8611cd0d9f71" data-toggle="modal" type="button">69</button></sup>

</div> However, these items were eventually not listed in the charges brought against Parti and no police photographs were taken of them when the police visited the Liew’s household on 3 December 2016. Some of these items were in fact items that Mr Liew had suspected Parti had stolen from him over the years (see above at [9]). The inconsistencies between the charges/police photographs and the FIR point towards the fact that Mr Liew made the police report concerning hundreds of allegedly stolen items after spending a relatively short amount of time looking through the jumbo boxes without proper documentation of the allegedly stolen items, even though there was no ostensible need for an urgent police report given that Parti had already left Singapore. There was more than sufficient time for Mr Liew to have properly documented the stolen items before making the FIR. Indeed, that would have been crucial contemporaneous evidence of the items discovered by the Liew family in the three jumbo boxes allegedly stolen by Parti. It is also curious that the police report was stated to have been made only “<span class="font-italic">for record purp</span><span class="font-italic">oses as I’m afraid that her boyfriends might cause a nuisance or break into my apartment</span>” [emphasis added].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the light of the above circumstances, the Defence has sufficiently demonstrated an underlying factual basis in support of its allegation of an improper motive on the part of Karl and Mr Liew. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Prosecution must show beyond a reasonable doubt that no such improper motive existed in relation to why the police report was made just <span class="font-italic">two days</span> after Parti made explicit to two members of Liew’s family of her intention to lodge a complaint to the MOM about being required to work illegally at Karl’s residence at 39 CL and at Karl’s office. Given the seriousness of the consequences that might follow from what Parti said she would do, I have reason to believe that the Liew family would be very concerned that Parti would carry out her threat to report the matter to MOM. On the totality of the evidence, I find that the Prosecution has failed to dispel the reasonable doubt raised by the Defence and show that there was no improper motive by Mr Liew and Karl in making the police report.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parti’s failure to inquire about the three jumbo boxes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Judge also took into account the fact that despite having returned to Indonesia for more than a month, Parti never showed any interest in finding out why she had not received her three jumbo boxes, if those items in the boxes were truly hers. The Judge observed that Parti’s purpose of returning to Singapore was to find new employment instead of following up on the jumbo boxes (Judgment at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, in my judgment, the Judge placed undue emphasis on this factor in her decision. The reasoning is internally inconsistent as the jumbo boxes contained many of Parti’s items as well. It was not the case that the jumbo boxes only contained the Liew family’s items <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span>. The fact that Parti ostensibly displayed the same amount of or lack thereof interest in relation to the jumbo boxes that <span class="font-italic">also contained</span> <span class="font-italic">her items </span>puts paid to the contention that Parti’s lack of interest toward her jumbo boxes supported the Prosecution’s case that the items in the boxes were not “truly hers”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 There was also no evidence adduced at trial to show how long it would actually take to have the jumbo boxes shipped to Parti’s hometown in Indonesia, whether Parti knew the time needed for the shipment and that there was therefore an inordinate delay when the jumbo boxes did not arrive within a month or so such that she should be sufficiently concerned to make enquiries for the delay in the shipment. Thus, Parti’s lack of interest as to Mr Liew’s failure in delivering the three jumbo boxes is at best, an equivocal indicia.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chain of custody of evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I now turn to the issue of the break of chain of custody of the evidence found in the three jumbo boxes. The Defence submits that there was a break in the chain of custody of evidence in respect of the three jumbo boxes after Parti left the house on 28 October 2016 to the time when the evidence was taken into custody by the police. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 After the Video was taken on 29 October 2016, Mdm Ng testified that she put Parti’s belongings back into the boxes and <span class="font-italic">took out the Liew family’s belongings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>from the boxes for daily use.

</div>
</div> This aspect of the evidence is crucial because these exhibits were not seized by the police immediately – the complainants took back their belongings that were allegedly stolen by Parti in three jumbo boxes and handled them for their daily use. This means that not every item from the three boxes at the point of discovery was placed back into the three jumbo boxes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This creates a real possibility of a mix up of the items: items were removed from the three jumbo boxes for the Liew family’s daily use over a period of time and then items used daily were put back into the boxes, with no clarity if the returned items are the same items that have been removed earlier. This is especially so if there were no special markings made on those items when they were first removed from the boxes to identify them and no proper record kept of how many and what type of items were removed from the jumbo boxes for their daily use. These items may well look similar to other items used daily in Liew household. Over a period of time, it would be difficult to recall exactly what number of and which items were taken out of the boxes. The Defence rightly submits that there was no contemporaneous evidence of the specific items, save for the Video recording, to determine with any level of certainty or precision as to what exact items were found inside the three boxes at the point in time which Parti left 49 CL. The Defence contends that given the sheer number of items alleged to be stolen by Parti, other items (that were not in fact from the jumbo boxes) could have been mistakenly added to the items that were in the boxes. In support of this reasonable doubt, Karl was only able to identify 34 specific pieces of items from the Video footage, leaving many items unaccounted for with reference to the items alleged to be stolen from Karl in the 2nd charge.

This means that apart from the Video footage, there is a lack of <span class="font-italic">contemporaneous evidence</span> of the specific items that were found in the three jumbo boxes allegedly stolen by Parti. The photographs taken by the police on 3 December 2016 would have been (a) premised on the complainants’ memory some five weeks later of the many items which they had retrieved and identified as theirs from the three jumbo boxes and (b) subjected to the complainants’ daily use of the items. The break in the chain of custody of evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to whether certain of the allegedly stolen items that were first discovered by the Liew family on 29 October 2016 were accurately documented by the photographs taken of the allegedly stolen items from the three jumbo boxes some five weeks later on 3 December 2016. Accordingly, I find that Parti’s conviction in relation to a number of the items allegedly found in the three jumbo boxes cannot stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The recorded statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I turn now to the ancillary issue of the accuracy of Parti’s recorded statements.

In the absence of an expert witness who could give evidence on the differences between both languages in relation to the Bahasa Melayu words used during the statement taking, which were translated and recorded in English, both languages must be assumed to be sufficiently different such that it can create reasonable doubt as to the complete accuracy of the statement recording in order to avoid unfair prejudice to the accused. This is especially pertinent in the light of the voluminous quantity of items in which Parti was questioned on in specific detail. Further, Parti was questioned not with reference to the actual physical items which were the subject of the proceeded charges, but instead with reference to the photographs of the numerous items annexed to the statement.

In this regard, appropriate weight must be accorded to the statements when considering the specific answers in P32 and P33 relied on by the Judge for the conviction of the proceeded charges. Furthermore, the use of some poor quality black and white photographs during the taking of the statement P33 made the identification of some of the items difficult for Parti.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In my judgment, the Judge erred in convicting Parti by focusing on the issue of whether <span class="font-italic">permission</span> had been given to Parti to take the Pioneer DVD player on the basis of Q18/A18 in P33 (Judgment at [23]). I say so for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 First, the Judge wrongly inferred that Parti made an admission in P33 as Q18/A18 does not by itself demonstrate that no permission had been granted to Parti to take the Pioneer DVD player. The substance of Q18/A18 focuses on whether Parti had <span class="font-italic">informed </span><span class="font-italic">anyone </span>(including Mdm Ng or Mr Liew) that she was taking the said DVD player.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Judge’s focus on Q18/A18 wrongly premises the element of “no consent” on a requirement that Parti had to inform her employers that she was taking an item that they had decided to throw away. It could well have been possible for Parti to have taken the Pioneer DVD player after Mdm Ng instructed her to throw the DVD player away and she decided to keep it without informing anyone instead. This would not have constituted dishonest taking of the Pioneer DVD player. In my judgment, the offence of theft as a servant is equally not made out if Parti had appropriated an item that her employers decided to throw away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Additionally, when Q18/A18 is read in context with the rest of P33, it is unclear how the Judge could have interpreted Q18/A18 as an admission by Parti to satisfy the element “without that person’s consent” for the offence of theft as a servant under s 381 of the Penal Code. A close reading of Q18/A18 with Q15/A15 and Q17/A17 reveals the plain inference to be drawn from Parti’s statement to be that (a) Parti was instructed by Mdm Ng to throw away the Pioneer DVD player if it was spoilt; (b) Parti thought that the Pioneer DVD player was spoilt and decided to take it back with her to Indonesia with the intention to fix it; and (c) she did not inform anyone that she was taking the “DVD players”. It is significant to note that Parti’s answers in P33, a statement taken from Parti just two days after her arrest, are entirely consistent with her defence that Mdm Ng had asked her throw away the Pioneer DVD player on the condition that it was spoilt (Q15/A15). Since Parti thought it was spoilt (Q17/A17), there was no dishonest taking of the said DVD player. Further, I also observe that Q16 makes absolutely no sense due to obvious grammatical or accuracy errors made by IO Amir. Any retrospective attempt to now imply any meaning to Q16 through the implantation of possible words (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “know”, “test”, “inform your employers that” or “know if your employers knew”) in the context of the preceding and latter questions would be an entirely speculative and fruitless exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, the Judge failed to consider the circumstances under which P33 was recorded, where a reasonable doubt exists as regards the accuracy of the answers in P33. P33 was recorded in English and read to Parti in Bahasa Melayu. This, the Defence submits, renders it conceivable that the particulars of P33 had been misheard or mistranslated.

</div> Parti testified that an example of this is at Q14/A14 of P33, where her answer was inaccurately recorded as her having said that she had placed the Pioneer DVD player “into” one of the three boxes, when she had actually placed it “near” the boxes and was not sure if Robin had put it inside the box.

</div> While nothing material turns on this alleged error, this is an example of how the mistranslation could have occurred in the statement recording process. Additionally, the existence of obvious errors in Q16 and A17 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, missing words or letters) supports the likelihood that IO Amir made errors in accurately recording P33 itself, especially given the fact that the statement was recorded at 1.44am to 5.57am on 4 December 2016.

</div> With the likelihood of inaccuracies in the recording of P33 itself, I find that it is unsafe to convict Parti primarily based on her “admission” based on Q18/A18 of P33. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Third, in the light of the above, the examination of the evidence regarding the working condition of the said DVD player is crucially relevant to Parti’s defence, contrary to the Judge’s observation at [23] of the Judgment. If the Pioneer DVD player was indeed found to be spoilt, this would lend greater credibility to Parti’s defence as it was not a mere fabrication on her part, and in particular that Parti had in fact been instructed by Mdm Ng to throw away the Pioneer DVD player if it was spoilt. With that, I turn now to examine the evidence in this respect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I start by addressing the Judge’s observations in relation to the working condition of the Pioneer DVD player. The Judge referenced Mdm Ng’s testimony that the Pioneer DVD player did not break down for the purposes of contradicting Parti’s version of events that Mdm Ng had wanted to throw the said DVD player away. Thereafter, the Judge observed that Mr Anil accused the Prosecution of using a “sleight-of-hand” technique to demonstrate in court that the Pioneer DVD player was working (Judgment at [22]). The Judge then commented on Mr Anil’s attempt to introduce evidence from the bar by giving an explanation of how the Pioneer DVD player could not be played, noting that such evidence should have been elicited from Parti in examination-in-chief or re-examination if she had wanted to retract her concession that the DVD player was working, or alternatively introduced through an expert witness (Judgment at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 At the trial below, Parti was cross-examined on the working condition of the Pioneer DVD player.

</div> The fact that there were such difficulties with the functionality of the Pioneer DVD player was however neither disclosed to the accused prior to the cross-examination of Parti on the working condition of the Pioneer DVD player nor to the Judge in the trial below. If the Prosecution had known of this defect in the Pioneer DVD player during the trial below, it should have fully disclosed it. The trial court could be misled into thinking that the Pioneer DVD player was in a good working condition when questions were (and unfairly) put to Parti was on the basis that the  DVD player was still in a good working condition after an incomplete demonstration of its important functionalities during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I agree with the Judge’s observation against the introduction of evidence from the bar: the evidence on the working condition of the Pioneer DVD player should ideally be introduced via witnesses – particularly from expert witnesses where technical issues are concerned such as the working condition and functionalities of the DVD player. However, I should also emphasise that in the conduct of judicial proceedings, the rule against introducing evidence from the bar should apply <span class="font-italic">equally </span>to both the Prosecution and the Defence. In the Judgment, the Judge did not address the veracity of Mr Anil’s allegations against the Prosecution’s “sleight-of-hand” technique to demonstrate in court that the Pioneer DVD player was working (Judgment at [23]). In my view, the technical evidence of the functionality of the Pioneer DVD should have been adduced by way of a witness who would then be subject to cross-examination by the Defence. The fact that the said Pioneer DVD player was only <span class="font-italic">partially functioning</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it was able to play videos from the hard disk component, but not able to play a DVD) was not disclosed or clarified by the Prosecution during their cross-examination of Parti at the trial below. I observe that this is particularly prejudicial to the accused since Parti was never given an opportunity to test the Pioneer DVD player until the day of the trial itself.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 This aspect of the evidence by way of a “lengthy explanation of how the DVD player could not be played” was instead classified by the Judge as a mere attempt by Mr Anil to introduce evidence from the bar (Judgment at [23]) even though the Judge ostensibly had no issue with the Prosecution doing the same during its cross-examination of Parti. The conduct of the proceedings below illustrates the dangers of introducing technical evidence directly from the bar and not through an expert witness who would have done a comprehensive assessment of the whole functionality of the Pioneer DVD player and consequently be subject to cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I re-emphasise that it is generally inappropriate to introduce evidence from the bar. That being said, in fairness to the accused, I find that the agreed positions adopted by the Prosecution and the Defence on the <span class="font-italic">partial </span><span class="font-italic">functionality</span> of the Pioneer DVD player after the demonstration at the appeal hearing before me would be far more reliable than the evidence adduced in the trial below by way of evidence from the bar with a demonstration in court of only one functionality of the DVD player and then concluding that it was therefore in a working condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As its name suggests, a DVD player’s main function is to play a DVD. Notwithstanding its ability to play from its hard disk, a DVD player that is unable to play a DVD can reasonably be described as “spoilt”. This fact directly contradicts Mdm Ng’s testimony that the Pioneer DVD player did not break down. Additionally, I note that the Judge failed to consider an aspect of Mr Liew’s testimony where he conceded that it was possible that the Pioneer DVD player was not working and if so, would be of no use to him:

</div> Further, no evidence was adduced in relation to how Mr Liew could identify that those two <span class="font-italic">specific </span>Longchamp bags were indeed his, despite the Judge’s acknowledgement that “a Longchamp bag is a common bag that is available in Singapore” (Judgment at [24]).

</div> If these two particular Longchamp bags were indeed Mr Liew’s, there would be a good chance of Robin, his driver, noticing Mr Liew carrying either one of these bags at some point of time during his employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Defence submits that the Judge did not provide concrete evidence as to why Mr Liew’s testimony was to be preferred over Parti’s, beyond her personal doubt that Parti would be able to find discarded Longchamp bags of the same style as that used by Mr Liew. In its supplementary submissions, the Defence provided many articles in the mainstream media and online blogs on dumpster diving to support its contention that high-end branded items (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, of brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Coach, and Gucci) are found in trash bins in Singapore. Longchamp bags are classified as accessory luxury items that are ubiquitous. It is therefore not improbable for other persons living in or renting houses in the Chancery Lane area to also own them, and to discard them when decluttering or moving out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I note that these articles and online blogs should have been admitted by way of a criminal motion to adduce fresh evidence on appeal. The articles and online blogs are from the internet and their reliability might be suspect at times. As such, I did not specifically rely on the contents of the articles and online blogs. I nevertheless took judicial notice of the general fact that there are some people who do look for a myriad of discarded items, including luxury items, at trash bin areas or disposal points and there is much force in the Defence’s submissions, which I have set out in some detail in [103] above. On the whole, I agree with the Defence that the Judge erred in simply jumping to the conclusion that Parti would not have been able to chance on two discarded Longchamp bags of the same style as the bags used by Mr Liew as a basis for her conviction on the 1st charge in respect of the two Longchamp bags</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As for the inconsistency in Parti’s evidence highlighted by the Prosecution between Parti finding the two Longchamp bags near the rubbish bin or rubbish area at 49D Chancery Lane in an “<span class="font-italic">abandoned suitcase</span>” (as stated in her statement in P31) as opposed to finding them in a “<span class="font-italic">big bag</span>” (as stated in her EIC), I do not find this inconsistency to be material as both instances of Parti’s evidence do refer to some form of repository to store the two Longchamp bags.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Furthermore, I am cognisant that during the recording of P31, Parti spoke in Bahasa Indonesia and what she said had to be interpreted into English. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that these two specific Longchamp bags in the charge in fact belonged to and were in the possession of Mr Liew. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">“Employed in the capacity of a servant”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I also observe that the element of “being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant” in the offence under s 381 of the Penal Code is also not made out since the end date of Parti’s employment was on 27 October 2016, as was reflected in her Foreign Domestic Worker Employment History (Exhibit D9).

</div> In this respect, the Judge should have amended the 1st charge under s 381 of the Penal Code to a charge of theft in dwelling-house charge under s 380 of the Penal Code instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 For all of the above reasons, I find that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether Parti had committed theft by a servant of all three items contained in the 1st charge.

The Judge found sufficient reasonable doubt whether some of the items were indeed Karl’s because of (a) his inability to recall if some items had ever been in his possession or whether he had worn them; and (b) the items were smaller-sized female clothing (Judgment at [2] and [26]). In particular, the Judge also excluded Item 29/120 as it was a quilt cover and could not be classified as an “item of clothing” (Judgment at [27]). The Judge also removed two black wallets, namely one Gucci and one Braun Buffel wallet, from the 2nd charge as Karl was unable to recall much about the items, apart from claiming that his wallets were gifts from his family. There was no evidence that Karl had used these wallets as he was unfamiliar with the wallets and the condition that they were in (Judgment at [28]). More pertinently, the style of the wallets did not appear to be men’s wallets and the Judge found it likely that Karl was “mistaken about these two wallets having been gifted to him” (Judgment at [29]). Parti’s evidence was that these two wallets were given to her by her friend, Diah (Judgment at [29]). Finally, the Judge amended the value of the Gerald Genta watch from $25,000 in the original charge to $10,000, as the Prosecution had invited the Court to do (Judgment at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Karl’s Credibility </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 As elucidated above at [16], where findings of fact hinge upon the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, the appellate court will only interfere if the findings of fact can be shown to be <span class="font-italic">plainly wrong</span> or <span class="font-italic">against the weight of the evidence</span>.This court remains entitled to ascertain (a) whether the Judge’s assessment of Karl’s credibility is plainly wrong or against the weight of evidence; and (b) if the Judge’s decision is inconsistent with the material objective evidence on record, bearing in mind that an appellate court is in as good a position to assess the internal and external consistency of the witnesses’ evidence, and to draw the necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 at [55], citing <span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v PP </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 at [32].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Judge described the Prosecution’s witnesses (which includes Karl) as “largely credible” and found their evidence to be clear, compelling and consistent even under lengthy cross-examination and did not find any reason to disbelieve them (Judgment at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Having evaluated the evidence, I am troubled by various aspects of Karl’s evidence that the Judge appears not to have considered. In my judgment, these cast serious doubts on Karl’s credibility and I find that the Judge’s assessment of Karl as largely credible with clear, compelling and consistent evidence (Judgment at [17]) is plainly wrong and against the weight of the evidence. In particular, the Judge failed to fully appreciate the reasoning behind her decision to remove the seven items from the 2nd charge, which should have had a material effect on her assessment of Karl’s credibility. The alleged items were mostly removed from the 2nd charge because there existed a reasonable doubt as to whether some of the items in the original 2nd charge were Karl’s. Once the Judge found on that basis that the conviction in relation to the seven items allegedly in Karl’s possession could not be sustained, it was incumbent on her to reappraise the entirety of Karl’s credibility in that light, instead of simply justifying Karl’s ostensible lack of credibility with his inability to recall if some items (including smaller-sized female clothing) had ever been in his possession or if he had ever worn them (Judgment at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I now turn to examine these items in further detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In relation to the two black wallets (P4 and P5), Karl testified in the trial below that these two black wallets were his and <span class="font-italic">insisted</span> that was so under cross-examination.

The Judge also assessed that Karl was “not able to recall much about the items apart from saying that all his wallets were gifts from his family” and that “there was no evidence that Karl had used these wallets either as he was unfamiliar with the wallets or the condition that they were in” (Judgment at [28]).

Karl’s evidence was internally inconsistent and contradicted by the other witnesses. Karl’s testimony that he had in his possession multiple female items that Parti allegedly stole from him is also highly suspect. It is unclear how the Judge could have arrived at the conclusion that this was a result of Karl’s “inability to recall if some items had ever been in his possession”, especially when some of the items were observed by the Judge to be “smaller-sized female clothing” and wallets that “did not appear to be men’s wallets” (Judgment at [26] and [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I find that the Judge’s eventual finding that the Prosecution’s witnesses (which includes Karl) were largely credible with clear, compelling and consistent evidence (Judgment at [17]) is simply unjustified and is in my judgment, against the weight of the evidence. Karl’s dishonesty on the stand was plainly evident from his testimony and the Judge failed to fully appreciate her decision to amend the 2nd charge in relation to Karl’s lack of credibility. The fact that Karl lied about particular items in the 2nd amended charge does not only taint his credibility as a witness but also affects the convictions for the items in the 2nd charge that are premised on Karl’s testimony alone. This also bolsters my earlier finding in relation to Karl’s improper motive to file the police report against Parti.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 With that in mind, I now turn to analyse the conviction for the items that remained in the amended 2nd charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">115 pieces of clothing (P24)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In her decision to convict Parti on the 2nd charge for having stolen the 115 items of clothing that were in Karl’s possession, the Judge did not find the need to delve into the details of each and every item (Judgment at [37]). Instead, it would appear that the Judge based the conviction on the fact that Karl “confirmed that he had never given [Parti] any clothes” and Mdm Ng only gave Parti clothes that were hers (meaning, Mdm Ng’s), and not anyone else’s (Judgment at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Parti’s defence is that some of the shirts were given to her by May’s husband, Robin and Mdm Ng while the rest of the clothing were purchased by her. Parti also denied that she wanted to pack Karl’s clothes into the boxes and testified that these clothes must have been packed into the boxes by Robin and Ismail. Parti also argued that she did not put that many clothes into the three jumbo boxes and that all of the items that comprise the original 120 items of clothing in the 2nd charge came from the items in the Black Bag which Karl had given to Jane, who then passed it to Parti.

This shows that Karl had no issues even with discarding and giving away his expensive clothing such as suits and jackets after he had used them. The Black Bag was returned to Karl on the morning that Parti’s employment was terminated. These facts are undisputed. The Black Bag was left next to the mirrored pillar on the floor even after the three jumbo boxes were sealed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The potential contamination of evidence occurred <span class="font-italic">after </span>Parti had left the house when Mdm Ng, Heather and Karl opened the three jumbo boxes on 29 October 2016. In the trial below, no evidence was led on how the members from the Liew household dealt with the items from the Black Bag, separated the clothing found in the jumbo boxes and the Black Bag or ensured that the clothing from both sources were not mixed up when they first discovered that their items where allegedly found in the jumbo boxes. Indeed, the Prosecution fairly conceded this point.

The likelihood of contamination is further bolstered by the fact that the Prosecution conceded that some of the 115 pieces of clothing contained in the 2nd charge were in fact <span class="font-italic">office clothing</span> that matched the description of the used clothing that Karl had given away to Jane in the Black Bag.

</div> The conversation, as crucial contemporaneous evidence at the time of the Liew family’s discovery of the items in the three jumbo boxes, indicated that the Liew family had the intention to throw the items away and did not have the habit of hoarding items. This is buttressed by the photographs taken of the interior of the Liew’s family house at 49 CL, which shows the house to be in a very neat and tidy condition. I do not get any impression that the Liew family would have the habit of keeping old, unwanted or spoilt items in the house and not discard them.

These items included numerous pieces of clothing sprawled on the floor captured in the Video, which included some of the 115 pieces of clothing that Parti was alleged to have stolen.

This cleaning rag was included as one of the items in one of the 115 pieces of clothing valued at $150 each for the purposes of the 2nd charge. In my view, the fact that a cleaning rag was found in the jumbo boxes supports the Defence’s contention that there was contamination of the clothing contained in the 2nd charge with clothing from the Black Bag of clothes that Jane herself did not want. There is no conceivable reason for Parti to have taken a used t-shirt that had previously been used as a cleaning rag back to Indonesia. Coupled with the issues in relation to the chain of custody mentioned above, I find that there is contamination of the evidence in relation to the 2nd charge with clothing from the Black Bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Because of the manner in which the primary evidence was handled by the Prosecution witnesses, there is no way of ascertaining which of the 115 pieces of clothing alleged to be stolen by Parti were from the three jumbo boxes or from the Black Bag.

On the other hand, Karl’s testimony regarding the blanket (P23) and the three bedsheets (P22, in photographs P1-11 and P1-12) is uncorroborated. Karl’s wife, Heather, testified that she had never seen the bedsheet (in photograph P1-11) in her room or on her bed in 49 CL

On a totality of the evidence, and in particular, the objective evidence which strongly suggests that the bedsheet was from IKEA, I find that Karl fabricated his testimony about having purchased the bedsheet from Habitat in the UK. Instead, I believe Parti’s evidence that she purchased the bedsheet (in photograph P1-11) together with the quilt cover as a set from IKEA. Clearly, the conviction for theft of the bedsheet (in photograph P1-11) is against the weight of the evidence and is not sustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For the remaining items, Parti’s defence is that the blanket (P23) and the other two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) were given to her by May.

</div> Since Karl gave no evidence as to how the blanket (P23) and the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) came into his possession, and May had never seen the blanket (P23) and the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) before, the Prosecution has nothing to rely on but a bare assertion by Karl that he owned the blanket (P23) and the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) to support the conviction in relation to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Given that the conviction of Parti in relation to the blanket (P23) and the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) is premised primarily on the uncorroborated testimony of Karl and having regard to Karl’s poor credibility and the break in chain of custody, I find that the conviction in relation to these remaining items (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the blanket (P23) and the other two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12)) is unsafe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I also note that May contradicted Parti’s evidence of May’s gift in respect of the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) and the blanket (P23). The Judge relied on this to reject Parti’s defence (Judgment at [41]). However, I do not give May’s evidence on the blanket (P23) and two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) much weight because of May’s lack of credibility as a witness. Karl’s testimony in relation to the ownership of the blanket and three bedsheets was likely motivated by an improper motive as explained in detail above in [34] to [51]. Given the situation, May might not have been objective in her evidence as she is a member of the Liew family as Karl’s sister and Mr Liew’s daughter. Her credibility is tainted by the improper motive on the part of Karl and Mr Liew when she gave evidence to support Karl’s testimony. Further, there are other issues concerning May’s credibility as a witness which I elaborate below at [187]. My conclusion is that the conviction in relation to the blanket (P23) and the two bedsheets (in photograph P1-12) under the 2nd charge remains unsafe. It must always be borne in mind that the burden of proof lies in the Prosecution to prove all the elements of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. I find that it has failed to discharge the burden in this instance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Philips DVD player (P20)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In relation to the Philips DVD player, Parti testified that the Philips DVD player had been “given” to her by Mdm Ng during her employment in 2010 when she requested for a television and DVD player to use in her room.

On the other hand, the Judge rejected Parti’s version of events because (a) it was contradicted by Mdm Ng’s testimony; and (b) if the Philips DVD player had been left under the network box, there was no reason for the Philips DVD player to have been packed into the jumbo boxes; and (c) there was no mention of DVDs being found in Parti’s possession or in the jumbo boxes (Judgment at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 However, given the chain of custody issue and that there was no cataloguing of items that were removed from the three jumbo boxes as previously chronicled (see above at [61]), there is a reasonable probability that the DVD player could have been left in Parti’s room and the Liew family simply added it as one of the items allegedly stolen by Parti. This must be considered in the light of (a) the absence of any contemporaneous evidence that the DVD player did in fact come out of the three jumbo boxes; and (b) an improper motive on the part of Mr Liew and Karl (elaborated above at [46] to [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Defence also submits that Heather’s testimony demonstrates that possession and ownership of the Philips DVD player was in fact Heather’s and not Karl’s.

There was sufficient evidence pointing towards the fact that the DVD player was in the possession of Heather who bought the DVD player.

</div> It would simply have been impossible for Karl to have owned the pink knife in 2002 during his university studies if, on his own admission, it had not been in production by that time. This is another example of Karl’s internally inconsistent evidence that went against both his claim of ownership of the pink knife and his credibility, which the Judge failed to address in the Judgment. Further, Karl testified that he could not remember using the pink knife at any time in the UK or in Singapore.

Even though I note that there were slight differences in Parti’s accounts for each item, I did not find them to be materially different such that it would cast doubt on her testimony.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In any case, it appears that the Judge had misapplied the legal and evidential burdens of proof. The Judge considered the fact that many items were purportedly purchased from the thrift shop, Hock Siong and yet no representative from Hock Siong was called by the Defence to confirm if Parti was indeed a visitor of the shop or if the shop sold a wide range of second-hand items (that included kitchenware). The Judge essentially drew an adverse inference (though not explicitly stated as such) against the Defence for its failure to call a witness from Hock Siong to the stand to verify the veracity of Parti’s alleged patronage of Hock Siong. In my judgment, this constitutes an impermissible reversal of the burden of proof on the accused. It appears that the same standard of proof was not demanded or required of the Prosecution. No adverse inferences were drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call witnesses who could corroborate or support Karl’s internally contradictory testimony regarding his alleged ownership of the pink knife. It is clear that the Prosecution is unable to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt solely on the basis of Karl’s testimony due to his evident lack of credibility. I emphasise that an accused person is presumed innocent and this presumption is not displaced until the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proof: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [59] and [61]. Simply put, it is not the responsibility of the Defence to disprove the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Finally, the Judge considered the fact that “[t]here was also no evidence led as to why the accused would have needed to purchase chopsticks. Did she ordinarily use chopsticks to eat during meal times?” (Judgment at [44]). In my judgment, it is unclear how this factor is relevant to Parti but does not equally apply to Karl. If this adverse inference drawn against Parti but not Karl is premised on a preconceived notion that Parti’s need to purchase chopsticks calls for an explanation, this is an assumption that is unreasonably held and without basis. In fact, the logic of this reasoning applies both ways. Assuming that it is accepted that Parti had no need to purchase the chopsticks because she did not use chopsticks to eat during meal times, there would equally have been no explicable reason for Parti to have stolen the chopsticks which she did not use for her meals and which were valued only at $2.

For the reasons explained above, Karl’s testimony at trial was internally inconsistent and insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that the utensils and kitchenware were purchased by Karl in the manner he had described. Accordingly, a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the kitchenware and utensils were truly owned by Karl. On balance, I am more inclined to accept Parti’s evidence that she was the one who actually bought the kitchenware and utensils.

</div> The Judge found that it was implausible for Karl to have thrown things out if he was hospitalised and instead, found that it was more likely that Karl’s absence gave Parti the opportune time to take the Helix watch (Judgment at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In my judgment, the Judge failed to give due weight to Karl’s admission that he could not recall if he had thrown out a watch that he himself had found to be ugly. In the light of the above, the conviction is rendered unsafe by the very fact that Karl was unable to positively confirm that he had not in fact discarded the Helix watch. This failure creates a reasonable doubt whether Parti had dishonestly moved the watch out of Karl’s possession. On balance, I am inclined to believe that Parti had merely retrieved something that Karl had discarded. Additionally, the Judge also did not consider the fact that the said Helix watch was a free gift from Shell according to the evidence of the horologist, Mr Eric Ong (“Mr Ong”), which only bolsters the likelihood that Karl had thrown this “ugly” free gift away.

</div> I agree. On top of Karl’s ostensible exaggeration of the monetary and sentimental value he gave to the Gerald Genta watch (see above at [116(a)]) and his lack of credibility, Karl’s inaction and his rather delayed claim in relation to the said watch only after 2 December 2016 (which was more than a month after Mr Liew’s police report) points towards the likelihood that this allegation was an afterthought and a likely further fabrication by Karl. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Judge considered that there was no reason for Karl to discard such an expensive watch despite its broken strap and missing knob (Judgment at [50]). While I do accept the fact that the Gerald Genta watch was one of a high value and hence agree that that would make it less likely that it was discarded, I do note that the many of the items alleged to be stolen by Parti, including the Gerald Genta watch, do display some form of dysfunctionality.

</div> It is rather unusual, to say the least, for Parti to mostly steal items that were ostensibly spoilt, broken or lacking in value to their alleged owners.

It is not unimaginable for a family moving to a new place of residence to pack and in the packing process, decide to discard certain items which are spoilt, broken, old or of little remaining use or value to them. Simply put, Parti’s explanation is neither unbelievable nor uncommon, especially when one considers this in the light of the affluence of the Liew household, Karl’s willingness to give away the Black Bag containing suits, jackets and pants, the neatness and tidiness of the interior of the house at 49 CL as can be seen from the photographs and the audio of the Video indicating that the Liew family were not hoarders (see above at [127]). Most crucially, Parti’s conviction in relation to the damaged Gerald Genta watch was based primarily on the testimony of Karl, whom I have assessed to be far from credible as a witness. Coupled with Karl’s delayed reporting and inaction (see above at [160]), I find that the Prosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

In my judgment, such objective evidence would have demonstrated either Karl’s or Heather’s ownership of those two specific iPhone 4 found in Parti’s possession. For instance, evidence of telephone calls or messages between other family members’ hand phones and the numbers registered to the SIM cards would have proved that the SIM cards (and hence the two iPhone 4 in that connection) did belong to Karl and not Heather. A forensic examination of the two iPhone 4 and SIM cards might also reveal the content of the messages to show whether the two iPhone 4 had been used by Karl or Heather and thus, the ownership of the two iPhone 4 could be more clearly inferred.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 There was no clear indication that those two specific iPhone 4 belonged to Karl and not Heather, much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for a conviction on a charge that specified that the two iPhone 4 were in the possession of Karl and not Heather. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Given that Parti’s defence is that she found the two iPhone 4 from the trash bags outside of 49 CL when Karl and Heather moved to 39 CL, the ownership of the two iPhone 4 either by Karl or Heather is not seriously disputed. Hence, I accept that the 2nd Charge could be readily amended to resolve the technical issue of the person(s) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from “Karl” to “either Karl or Heather”) in actual possession of the two iPhone 4 without prejudice to Parti. The more important anterior issue is whether the two iPhone 4 were truly discarded by Karl or Heather, and thereafter found by Parti in the trash bag. The Judge observed that it was inconceivable that Karl and Heather would refuse to sell the two iPhone 4 to Parti, and yet discard the two iPhone 4 with the SIM cards still intact (Judgment at [51]). In this regard, I observe that no evidence was adduced as to whether the SIM cards were pre-paid or post-paid. It is unclear what value the SIM cards could still have had if (a) they were pre-paid and had run out of value or had expired; or (b) they were post-paid with expired contracts. In this respect, I do not find the fact that the two iPhone 4 were discarded with their SIM cards still intact to be a material consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I observe that Parti’s version of events is not unbelievable.

</div> the said iPhones would have been outdated by approximately six years at the alleged time of the offence. Parti said that after she found the two iPhone 4 in the trash bag placed outside 49 CL, she tried to use the two iPhone 4 but they were not responsive and not working. Being old iPhones, I am not surprised that the batteries would not hold the electrical charge well after some years and that the two iPhone 4 were not responsive and not working when Parti found them. This makes it entirely plausible for the two iPhone 4 to be discarded when Karl and Heather moved to their new place of residence. Had the two iPhone 4 been newer or more recent models of iPhones that were released closer in time to 2016, this would have made Parti’s defence much less believable. The fact that the iPhone 4 model was outdated at the alleged time of the offence lends support to my observation above at [161] that many of the alleged items stolen by Parti appear to be old or dysfunctional and serve to reinforce Parti’s defence that she had in fact found these items in the trash and therefore she had not stolen the items. This creates a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the two iPhone 4 were discarded when Karl and Heather moved to their new place of residence and Parti found them subsequently in the trash bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 For all the above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has not proven the elements of the 2nd charge beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to all the items listed therein.

Overall, given the limited weight that should be accorded to P33 taking into account the fact that (a) it was read back to Parti in Bahasa Melayu; (b) Parti was not shown the physical items; and (c) numerous photographs were shown and many questions were asked in P33 in the wee hours of the morning, I would not give much weight to the inconsistency between Parti’s statement in P33 and her testimony in court.

Further, it is IO Tang’s evidence that he brought the Vacheron Constantin watch to ION Orchard to verify in its authenticity in “the boutique”, where he was informed that the said Vacheron Constantin watch was “not an original”.

</div> As a result, IO Tang was unable to value the Vacheron Constantin watch and therefore stated in the 3rd charge that the Vacheron Constantin watch was “with <span class="font-italic">unknown value</span>” [emphasis added]. Mr Ong’s testimony in relation to the authenticity of the Vacheron Constantin and Swatch watches was also unchallenged by the Prosecution. In the light of the above, I accept in entirety the evidence of Mr Ong, who had given cogent reasons why both were counterfeit watches. As I observed earlier, the fact that the allegedly stolen items tended to be of low value and in this instance, counterfeit, marshals in favour of a finding that both watches could have in fact been discarded by May. Further, the Defence rightly submits that as an investment banker from an affluent family, it makes it probable that May had discarded these counterfeit watches given her “social status” by 2012.

This also points to the same reasonable possibility that May had discarded these items. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Finally, I observe that the FIR did not include the assorted jewellery and fashion accessories as part of the list of items that Parti allegedly had stolen.

</div> I do not find these inconsistencies to be particularly material – they pertained only to specific details of the exact day and the type and location of the trash that Parti had retrieved the item from, bearing in mind that Parti had been retrieving a number of items from various rubbish bins and trash locations. ASP Lim, who recorded P31, admitted that during the four hour period of questioning, she and the interpreter went through the 70 questions and answers “in a quick manner” and also admitted to a number of errors in her statement recording.
