That implementation is by way of Part 11 of the IRDA, and s 252(1) of the IRDA provides that the Model Law (with certain modifications), as set out in the Third Schedule of the IRDA, has the force of law in Singapore. However, Part 11 is within that segment of the IRDA (Parts 4 to 12 of the IRDA) that deals with corporate entities. EH-REIT is clearly not a corporate entity. Rather, it is a collective investment scheme authorised under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SFA”) in which a designated trustee acts for the benefit of the unitholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I do not see anything in the IRDA or its language that would extend its application to EH-REIT. Part 4 and s 61(1) of the IRDA specify the interpretation of the terms used in Parts 4 to 12 of the IRDA, and it is clear that these are limited to corporate insolvency only – there is no mention of business trusts nor real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). This makes sense, as there is already the enactment of other legislation such as the Business Trusts Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) (“BTA”) and the SFA that would govern aspects of a business trust or a REIT (such as the winding up of a <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">registered business trust</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> under the BTA by order of court)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Additionally, the types of entities excluded from the scope of the Model Law, by the Minister’s orders under s 252(1) of the IRDA, suggest that the Model Law only applies to corporate<span class="font-italic"> </span>entities and that in a similar vein, non-corporate entities governed by the SFA (such as EH-REIT) do not fall within the scope of the Model Law. Section 252(1) of the IRDA provides that the Model Law has force of law, subject to certain modifications to adapt it for application, in Singapore. In turn, Art 1(2) of the Model Law provides that: “This Law does not apply to any proceedings concerning such entities or classes of entities which the Minister may, by order in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span>, prescribe.” The list of entities which are excluded can be found under para 5(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Prescribed Companies and Entities) Order 2020 which makes reference to a banking corporation, a finance company, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. Under para 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">z</span>), a trustee for a collective investment scheme authorised under s 286 of the SFA (and who is approved under s 289 of the SFA) is excluded from the scope of the Model Law. For completeness, it is also provided under para 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">z</span><span class="font-italic">f</span>) that “any other corporation that is licensed, approved, authorised, designated, recognised or registered under the provisions of … (ii) the Business Trusts Act; … (ix) the Securities and Futures Act …” is also excluded from the scope of the Model Law. Two observations may be made. First, the exclusion of entities relates mostly to corporate entities with a separate legal personality, unlike the present EH-REIT. Second, entities which are authorised under the SFA (or the BTA for that matter) are excluded from the scope of the Model Law, and it is logical to infer that EH-REIT itself would not come within the Model Law as well. One possible reason for the exclusion of entities under the SFA may be the need to cater for the interests of a large number of individual unitholders under the various collective investment schemes. Thus, EH-REIT does not come within the scope of the Model Law as implemented in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I note that under the US Bankruptcy Code, EH-REIT could be considered as a “corporation” for the purposes of being an eligible debtor under Chapter 11. As noted by Christopher Sontchi CJ in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re EHT US1, Inc </span>630 BR 410 (Bankr D Del, 2021) at 423: “Section 109(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that only ‘a person ... may be a debtor’ under Chapter 11. The term ‘person’ is defined under section 101(14) as including an ‘individual, partnership, and corporation...’ The term ‘corporation,’ in turn, is defined in section 101(9) as being limited to certain business entities, including a ‘business trust.’” Having determined that Singapore law governed the issue, Sontchi CJ held that EH-REIT was a business trust despite not being registered under the BTA after being persuaded by the expert testimony of Professor Hans Tjio (at 428). Thus, it was an eligible debtor under the US Bankruptcy Code. Given that Art 2(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Model Law provides that the reference to a “debtor” means a “corporation”, it may be arguable that the Model Law could apply to EH-REIT. However, the difficulty is that under our local legislation, specifically the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed), the term “corporation” under s 4(1) is not expressly defined to include business trusts (unlike the position in the US), much less a collective investment scheme authorised under the SFA. Hence, under Singapore law, EH-REIT is not a corporation, and consequently, not a “debtor” within meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Model Law. Further, as noted above at [27], entities relating to the BTA are also excluded from the scope of the Model Law as enacted in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 A contrary position has been taken in England. In <span class="font-italic">Rubin and another v Eurofinance SA and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2010] 1 All ER (Comm) 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Rubin (EWHC)</span>”), an entity known as The Consumers Trust (“TCT”) was brought into proceedings under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, and the US court approved a plan of liquidation under Chapter 11 (at [13]). The English High Court noted that this entity was considered as a “business trust” and that it was common ground that “bankruptcy proceedings can be brought in New York in relation to a business trust, even though it has no separate legal personality for any other purpose” (at [10]). The foreign representatives of TCT then sought recognition of the Chapter 11 case in England as a foreign main proceeding under the equivalent UK legislation enacting the Model Law. However, it was argued by the respondent that the Model Law could not apply as TCT was not a separate legal entity as a matter of English law (at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36. The first point taken in response to the application for recognition by Mr Staff is that, whilst it is clear that a business trust is treated in US bankruptcy law as a separate legal entity, and can be the subject of insolvency remedies—according to the applicants' United States counsel, Mr Friedman, TCT ‘is an insolvent corporate entity’—it is not a separate legal entity as a matter of English law. Articles 15 and 17, read together with the definitions of ‘foreign proceeding’ and ‘foreign representative’ in art 2 require the existence of ‘a debtor’. Mr Staff submits that the word ‘debtor’ must be given its ordinary meaning in English law, from which it follows that there is no debtor and that the Model Law cannot be applied in this case, or in any other case in which the insolvent estate in a foreign jurisdiction is not that of an individual or of a corporate entity recognised in English law as an independent legal entity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The English High Court rejected that submission and found that the Model Law could apply to business trusts. This was on the basis that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, having regard to the international origins of the Model Law and the need to promote uniformity in its application under Art 8, a “parochial interpretation” of the term “debtor” and the following “refus[al] to provide any assistance in relation to a bona fide insolvency proceeding taking place in a foreign jurisdiction” should be eschewed (at [40]). The English court then held that TCT was a “debtor” under the Model Law and recognised the Chapter 11 proceedings as a foreign main proceeding (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 While one can appreciate the need to promote uniformity in the application of the Model Law under Art 8, I do not think that <span class="font-italic">Rubin (EWHC)</span> should be followed in Singapore. In interpreting the Model Law as enacted in Singapore, s 252(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA allows us to have regard to the “Guide to Enactment of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross‑Border Insolvency”, UNCITRAL, 30th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/442 (1997) (“the  UNCITRAL 1997 Guide”). Additionally, the revised guide – “UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with Guide to Enactment and Interpretation” (2013) <https: en<br="" files="" media-documents="" sites="" uncitral="" uncitral.un.org=""></https:>/1997-model-law-insol-2013-guide-enactment-e.pdf&gt; (accessed 19 May 2022) (“the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide”) – may also be referred to as noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet Pte Ltd and others (Asia Aviation Holdings Pte Ltd, intervener) </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1343 (“<span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span>”) at [37] (where the UNCITRAL 1997 Guide is silent, the court may consider the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide but the UNCITRAL 1997 Guide prevails in the event of conflict). Neither document contains any mention that the Model Law is intended to apply to business trusts or REITs. Further, within the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide, it is provided that a contracting State to the Model Law still retains the sovereignty to decide which entities to exclude from its scope of application (at para 57):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57. Paragraph 2 indicates that the enacting State might decide to exclude the insolvency of entities other than banks and insurance companies; the State might do so where the policy considerations underlying the special insolvency regime for those other types of entity (e.g. public utility companies) call for special solutions in cross-border insolvency cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As observed above at [26]–[27], there is nothing in our domestic legislation which suggests that the Model Law could apply to EH-REIT (even if it could be described as a business trust) and on the contrary, it seems that Parliament wanted to exclude entities under the SFA from the Model Law as enacted in Singapore. Hence, I am doubtful that EH-REIT comes within the scope of the Model Law as implemented in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The restructuring of EH-REIT will probably have to proceed by way of a separate application for common law recognition and would have to involve the EH-REIT Trustee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DBS Trustee Limited), who was not present in this application. As will be explained below at [87], I cannot see how the Applicant can have the standing to make the application on behalf of DBS Trustee Limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 S1 and S2 do not run into this difficulty of falling outside the scope of the Model Law and I proceed with the analysis for these two corporate entities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings should be recognised as foreign main proceeding even though the presumptive COMI is in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I am persuaded by the Applicant’s submissions on the requirements of Art 17 (see above at [20]) as these are relatively uncontroversial issues. The Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code are clearly “foreign proceeding[s]” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) as stipulated under Art 17(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law, and this was previously recognised in <span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop Group International Pte Ltd and another (Triumphant Gold Ltd and another, non-parties)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2020] 4 SLR 680 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop</span>”) and noted in <span class="font-italic">Zetta</span><span class="font-italic"> Jet (No 2)</span> at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Rather, the key issue is whether the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings should be recognised as foreign main proceedings or foreign non-main proceedings. Under Art 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law, it is provided that the foreign proceeding must be recognised as a foreign main proceeding (which is defined in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Model Law) if it takes place in the State where the debtor has its COMI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The requirements for the determination of the COMI were considered in <span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span>. As noted at [80], the focus is on the centre of gravity of the objectively ascertainable factors. Further, in ascertaining the COMI, there is no need to maintain the distinction between different entities within a group strictly and it is possible for the analysis to be made of the activities of an entire group of companies (at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The starting point is the presumption under Art 16(3) of the Model Law, which operates such that the place of the debtor--company’s registered office is presumed to be its COMI (<span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> at [29]). Here, S1 and S2 are both incorporated in and have registered offices in Singapore. Thus, the COMI of both debtor companies is presumed to be Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, this presumption may be displaced if the place of the company’s central administration and various factors which are objectively ascertainable by third parties, particularly creditors and potential creditors of the debtor company, point the COMI away from the place of registration to some other location (<span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> at [76]; <span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop</span> at [12(b)]). The rebuttal of the presumption does not need to be made out on a balance of probabilities, but operates as a starting point that is subject to displacement by other factors on the presence of proof to the contrary (<span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> at [31]). Some factors which may be considered when determining the COMI are: the location of substantial assets, location of sales (<span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop</span> at [15]), the location from which control and direction were administered, the location of clients, the location of creditors, the location of operations, the governing law, <span class="font-italic">etc</span> (<span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Here, what commercial activity there was appeared to be centred in the US, particularly as regards S1, which is the indirect 100% holding company of USHIL Holdco Member, LLC and CI Hospitality Investment, LLC, which are in turn, indirect 100% holding companies for each of the Propcos that own the revenue-generating Hotels in the Eagle Hospitality Group portfolio. I note that S2 is only concerned with a Cayman entity (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the Cayman Corp) under it. However, it is apparent that S2 plays an important role in facilitating the distribution of dividends up to EH-REIT and the Stapled Security Holders from the income generated by the US-based Propcos (see above at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is clear that both S1 and S2 are not active, operational companies. Rather, they are part of the Eagle Hospitality Group, which has its main business operations and assets based in the US. The substantial assets in play, consisting of the portfolio of 18 full-service Hotels, are all located in the US where the income would be derived as well. These are immovable fixed properties and provide a good indication of the COMI, in contrast to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> (at [106]) where the location of planes was not indicative of the COMI as it was expected that assets in the business of aircraft rental and charter might be dispersed in the location most appropriate. In my view, the location of S1 and S2’s operations and substantial assets are therefore relevant indicators of their COMI being the US.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, S1 and S2 did not have creditors in Singapore as of 18 January 2021 (the date of their respective voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11). Their only creditors were in the US (such as the debt incurred under a credit facility with the Bank of America NA) according to their respective “Global Notes and Statement of Limitations, Methodology, and Disclaimers Regarding the Debtors’ Schedules of Assets and Liabilities and Statements of Financial Affairs” which were filed in the US Bankruptcy Court on 19 March 2021.

Another significant creditor was the Bank of the West, a bank headquartered in California, with an unsecured claim of US$18,448,253.94. Thus, the significant creditors of S1 and S2 are all based in the US. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 After S1 and S2 had filed their voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, there were some invoices billed to S1 and S2 from pre-petition Singapore creditors who had provided corporate secretarial services and incurred nominee director fees, but these were much smaller creditors (all of whom have been paid under the Chapter 11 process) and they do not shift the centre of gravity in determining the COMI.

</div>
</div> For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept these arguments as reasons for my conclusion above at [43] that the COMI of S1 and S2 is the US.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  To my mind, the fact that the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings are ongoing in the US is irrelevant in determining the COMI, as are the activities of the foreign representative. The jurisprudential basis of the COMI requirement is to determine the centre of gravity of the company’s commercial activity, that is, where it was centred while it was alive and flourishing – in other words, a corporation’s real home. A hospital bed, or a crypt, does not count. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for the relevance of a foreign representative’s actions to determining the COMI, I previously observed in <span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the foreign representative’s actions are irrelevant in the ascertainment of the COMI and rejected the approach taken in the US (at [101]–[103]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">101 The applicants point to the fact that the US-based Trustee undertook efforts to restructure Zetta Jet Singapore from the date of his appointment to the cessation of the business of the Zetta Entities, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 5 October 2017 to 30 November 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">102 However, I would not take the foreign representative’s actions as being relevant in the ascertainment of COMI. The work being done by the foreign representative would flow from the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign court on whatever basis it considers appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">103 I am mindful that I differ in this regard from the approach of the US courts … which held that ‘any relevant activities, including liquidation activities and administrative functions, may be considered in the COMI analysis’ ... I am not, however, convinced that it is proper to consider such activities in determining COMI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [103], the US position is that the activities of the foreign representative are relevant. In <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Fairfield Sentry Ltd</span> 714 F 3d 127 (2nd Cir, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">re Fairfield</span>”), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that “any relevant activities, including liquidation activities and administrative functions, may be considered in the COMI analysis” and it was observed that the COMI should correspond to the place where the debtor “conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties” (at 137–138). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the subsequent decision of <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Oi Brasil Holdings Coöperatief UA</span> 578 BR 169 (Bankr SDNY, 2017), <span class="font-italic">re Fairfield</span> was cited for the proposition that the activities of foreign liquidators and administrators could be relevant to a COMI analysis (at 222). However, the activities of a judicial administrator must be of sufficient significance to produce a shift in the COMI (at 222) and provide a meaningful basis for the expectation of third parties (at 223). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 That was the case in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re British American Isle of Venice</span> <span class="font-italic">(BVI) Ltd</span> 441 BR 713 (Bankr SD Fla, 2010), where the work done by the liquidator of the company was significant (reviewing the company’s books, taking control of company assets and undertaking the investigation of the investments, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) and the extended passage of time meant that third parties necessarily considered his office in the British Virgin Islands to be the location of the debtor company’s COMI (at 723). Where a foreign representative remains in place for an extended period and relocates the primary business of the debtor to his location, thereby causing creditors and other parties to look to the foreign representative, this could lead to the conclusion that the COMI has become lodged with the foreign representative (at 723).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Nevertheless, I decline to follow the US authorities. As I have noted previously in <span class="font-italic">Zetta Jet (No 2)</span> at [102], the “work being done by the foreign representee would flow from the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign court”. Where the business activities of a company are subsequently managed in the jurisdiction where the foreign proceedings were commenced, I do not think that creditors would necessarily look to the actions of the foreign representative. The US approach appears to be a form of bootstrapping and will allow the parties to choose their COMI (so to speak) in an artificial manner. To my mind, it would be better to assess the COMI by looking at the activities of the company before the foreign restructuring takes place (even though the relevant date for determining the COMI is at the date of application for recognition). The location of the activities of the foreign representative is therefore irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 While I appreciate that the US cases have set a relatively high threshold before the COMI can be shifted in this manner, I remain unconvinced that the foreign representative’s actions are relevant in determining the COMI. Looking to other jurisdictions, it appears that the work done and activities of the foreign representative are not usually considered by the courts around the world (in those jurisdictions which have adopted the Model Law) to be “among the most important” five factors in determining the COMI (see UNCITRAL, “Digest of Case Law on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency” (2021) <https: files="" media-documents="" sites="" uncitral.un.org="" uncitral<br=""></https:>/en/20-06293_uncitral_mlcbi_digest_e.pdf&gt; (accessed 22 May 2022) (“UNCITRAL Digest”) at p 41). In fact, it appears to be a largely US-centric phenomenon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I am therefore not persuaded by the Applicant’s submission that the fact that the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings are ongoing in the US, or the Applicant’s activities in his capacity as foreign representative, are relevant factors pointing to the COMI of S1 and S2 being the US. Nevertheless, in view of the findings above at [38]–[42] regarding the other factors applicable to the present case, the presumption that the COMI is Singapore is displaced in favour of the US. Accordingly, the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings are recognised as foreign main proceedings within meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and<span class="font-italic"> </span>pursuant to Art 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings should be recognised as Foreign Non-Main Proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Having decided that the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings in relation to S1 and S2 should be recognised as foreign main proceedings, the issue of whether they can be recognised as foreign non-main proceedings is now moot and does not arise on the facts. The fallback submission of the Applicant does not need to be considered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I turn to Applicant’s prayer that the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order be recognised as foreign proceedings under the Model Law.

For this third attribute to be satisfied, the control or supervision must be “formal in nature”, though it “may be potential rather than actual” and may be exercised directly by the court or indirectly through an insolvency representative (<span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> at [67]). Thus, it is sufficient for the foreign court to have supervision over the foreign insolvency representative who possesses direct control. One example cited by the Court of Appeal which satisfies this requirement is a proceeding in which the court has exercised control or supervision over the debtor company, but at the time of application for recognition, is no longer required to do so (<span class="font-italic">United Securities</span> at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Applicant cites a part of the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide (at para 75) which suggests that this court could recognise the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 … Proceedings in which the court has exercised control or supervision, but at the time of the application for recognition is no longer required to do so should also not be excluded. An example of the latter might be cases where a reorganization plan has been approved and although the court has no continuing function with respect to its implementation, the proceedings nevertheless remain open or pending and the court retains jurisdiction until implementation is completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">One could suggest that the Chapter 11 Plan, which has been approved by the Confirmation Order, is no different from a “reorganization plan” mentioned in the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide. This would mean that post-confirmation of the Chapter 11 Plan, the proceeding would still fall within the definition of a foreign proceeding under Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h)</span> of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Indeed, other materials support this interpretation. The authors of <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: A Commentary on the UNCITRAL Model Law</span> (Look Chan Ho gen ed) (Globe Law &amp; Business, 4th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">A Commentary on the UNCITRAL</span>”) observe at p 178 that a foreign insolvency proceeding will remain as a “foreign proceeding” even after judicial confirmation of a reorganisation plan, until the proceeding is closed and the debtor’s affairs are no longer subject to the foreign court’s control. In the UNCITRAL Digest, it is suggested (at p 8) that where a reorganisation plan has been approved and although the court has no continuing function with respect to its implementation, the proceeding nevertheless remains open or pending and the court retains jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to settle any dispute over the interpretation of the plan or to oversee the debtor’s performance pursuant to the plan) until implementation is completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 To better understand whether a court will still retain supervision and control, what happens after a Chapter 11 plan of liquidation has been confirmed is relevant. In <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Oversight and Control Commission of Avanzit, SA</span> 385 BR 525 (Bankr SDNY, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Oversight &amp; Control</span>”), this situation was summarised (at 535) as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Under the Bankruptcy Code, and unless the confirmation order or the plan states otherwise, confirmation revests the property of the estate in the debtor, free and clear of all claims and interests, 11 U.S.C. § 1141(b), (c), and discharges the debtor. 11 U.S.C. § 1141(d). The reorganized debtor goes about its business, free of the constraints placed on trustees under the Bankruptcy Code. When the case has been fully administered, a final decree is entered closing the case. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Between confirmation and the final decree, the bankruptcy court continues to exercise jurisdiction over the case, albeit in a more limited fashion. Thus, although the jurisdiction ‘shrinks,’ … it does not end. The bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction under 11 U.S.C. § 1142(b) to direct the debtor or any necessary party to execute an act necessary for the consummation of the plan and it has ‘continuing responsibilities to satisfy itself that the [p]lan is being properly implemented.’ …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, even after confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of liquidation and up until the final decree closing the case, the US bankruptcy court continues to maintain control or supervision necessary to implement the Chapter 11 plan even if this is in a more limited fashion. Case law under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code (which encapsulates the Model Law as enacted in the US) also suggests that a “foreign proceeding” under Article 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law is not restricted to the approval of a restructuring or repayment plan, but can extend to the implementation of the plan (see Look Chan Ho, <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: Principles and Practice</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Principles and Practice</span>”) at p 98). Further, leaving a foreign representative in control of the business and operations is not necessarily inconsistent with supervision by a foreign court (see <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Ashapura Minechem Ltd</span> 480 BR 129 (Bankr SDNY, 2012) at 138).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">Oversight &amp; Co</span><span class="font-italic">ntrol</span>, a petition was filed for recognition of Spanish proceedings under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. The equivalent of a Chapter 11 plan or a repayment agreement, known in Spain as a “convenio”, had been negotiated with the creditors and the convenio had been approved by the Spanish court. The issue was whether the control and supervision of the Spanish court ceased upon approving the convenio, such that the Spanish proceedings were no longer a “foreign proceeding” capable of recognition. It was undisputed by the parties (at 535) that the debtor company’s status was “similar to a chapter 11 debtor after confirmation”. The US court held that even though the management and daily control of the debtor company had been returned, the Spanish insolvency court had not surrendered all supervision and control as it continued to oversee the payment of claims to creditors and to settle any disagreement concerning the “interpretation, enforcement and/or performance” of the convenio (at 534). It may have been the case that the Spanish court’s level of control or supervision was reduced, but it had not entirely ceased. Hence, even after the “convenio” received final approval, the Spanish insolvency proceedings did not lose their status as a “foreign proceeding” as the Spanish court still exercised control and supervision over the debtor company’s assets and affairs, to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with and consummation of the convenio (at 536).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Some parallels may be drawn to the present circumstances. While the Chapter 11 Plan has been confirmed, it is provided in paragraph 40 of the Confirmation Order that the US Bankruptcy Court “shall retain and have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters” relating to the Chapter 11 Plan.

</div> hearing any disputes arising in connection with the “interpretation, implementation or enforcement” of the Chapter 11 Plan and recovering all assets of the debtor companies wherever located. In the circumstances, it would appear that the US Bankruptcy Court still retains some jurisdiction over the process under the Chapter 11 Plan, even after the Confirmation Order has been issued. Thus, the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order could fall within the scope of “foreign proceeding[s]” as defined in Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, as explained above at [56], my preference would be to give recognition to the Chapter 11 Plan and the Confirmation Order pursuant to Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law instead. At this juncture, it is relevant to point out that <span class="font-italic">Oversight &amp; Control</span> is perhaps one of the only few cases in which a post-confirmation repayment plan was recognised under Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law. As will be seen below, it is more orthodox to recognise the Chapter 11 Plan and the Confirmation Order under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law as a form of additional relief, and the cases in that regard are much more numerous. Hence, I make no pronouncement on whether a Singapore court has the ability to recognise a post-confirmation plan of liquidation (or other foreign insolvency judgments) under Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law, and leave this issue open for future determination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 21(1)(g) of the Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Article 21(1) of the Model Law provides that upon the recognition of a foreign proceeding, the court may grant any appropriate relief. Specifically, under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>), this includes granting any additional relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder, including any relief provided under s 96(4) of the IRDA. The Applicant submits that upon the recognition of the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings as “foreign proceedings”, the court is empowered to grant recognition and enforcement of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It is pertinent to note that the Model Law does not explicitly provide for the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency orders and judgments. Nevertheless, as proposed by the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide (at para 189), the list of reliefs in Art 21 should be regarded as non-exhaustive in nature and the court is not restricted unnecessarily in its ability to grant any type of relief that is required in the circumstances of the case. Hence, it is said that “[i]t is in the nature of discretionary relief that the court may tailor it to the case at hand” (the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide at para 191).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In some States, it has been suggested that the recognising court can give effect to the position in the foreign main proceeding, which might mean the relief that can be ordered in the recognising State is not limited to the relief that would be available in a hypothetical domestic insolvency proceeding (<span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Sino–Forest Corporation</span> 501 BR 655 (Bankr SDNY, 2013) at 665–666). In contrast, in other States, courts have held that the words “any appropriate relief” do not allow the court to grant relief that would not be available when dealing with a domestic insolvency (<span class="font-italic">Fibria Celulose S/A v Pan Ocean Co Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2014] Bus LR 1041 at [107]–[108]). I had previously commented in <span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop</span> (at [27]) that assistance of a particular form may not be granted if in the same circumstances it may be denied or is not available to a local representative. However, as explained below at [77]–[78], I am satisfied on the material before me that the court may, in appropriate circumstances, apply foreign insolvency law when granting discretionary relief under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law as the phrase “under the law of Singapore” has been deliberately omitted. The circumstances and degree of discretion can only be specified incrementally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Looking to the US cases, it is well-established in Chapter 15 jurisprudence that foreign insolvency orders and judgments may be recognised and enforced locally, subject to limited exceptions such as public policy considerations (<span class="font-italic">A Commentary on the UNCITRAL</span> at p 249; <span class="font-italic">Principles and Practice</span> at p 167).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The US equivalent of Art 21 of the Model Law is § 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">§1521.

For instance, in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Lupatech SA</span> 611 BR 496 (Bankr SDNY, 2020), it was noted (at 502) that “appropriate relief” under § 1521 includes “enforcing a foreign order confirming a debtor’s plan”, but that the relief will only be granted if the interests of the creditors and other interested entities are sufficiently protected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Consistent with this position, the US courts have recognised and enforced foreign insolvency-related court orders from abroad. In <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Salvati, </span>2009 Bankr LEXIS 5722 (Bankr SDNY, 7 May 2009), an English company had commenced proceedings before the English High Court for a scheme of arrangement pursuant to s 895 of the Companies Act 2006 (c 46) (UK). The scheme was approved at the sanction hearing, and a sanction order was granted. The US court held that the sanction order was entitled to recognition and enforcement in the US. Other English schemes of arrangement and the accompanying sanction orders have also been recognised and enforced in the US (see <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Magyar Telecom BV</span> 2013 Bankr LEXIS 5716 (Bankr SDNY, 11 December 2013)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re CGG SA </span>579 BR 716 (Bankr SDNY, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">re CG</span><span class="font-italic">G SA</span>”), the applicant sought the recognition and enforcement of an order entered by a French court sanctioning a French safeguard plan (which restructured the debts of the company). The French court had given a sanctioning order after the safeguard plan had obtained the requisite approval from creditors. The US court held (at 720) that “the recognition and enforcement of the [s]anctioning [o]rder [was] ‘appropriate relief’ under section 1521(a) of the Bankruptcy Code” and gave the sought-after relief. However, the US court did not do so blindly, but also took notice that (a) the interests of the creditors and shareholders were sufficiently protected under the safeguard plan; (b) the interested parties had been given the opportunity to be heard in the French court; and (c) the safeguard plan might not be fully implemented if relief were not granted, to the detriment of the parties who fully supported it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In addition to the foregoing brief survey of authorities, other authorities demonstrating that the US courts are open to recognising and enforcing foreign insolvency-related orders and judgments from various jurisdictions include: <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Oi SA</span> 587 BR 253 (Bankr SDNY, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">re Oi SA</span>”) (concerning a Brazilian reorganisation plan); <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Metcalfe &amp; Mansfield Alternative Investments</span> 421 BR 685 (Bankr SDNY, 2010) (a Canadian plan of compromise and arrangement); and <span class="font-italic">In re Energy Coal</span> <span class="font-italic">SPA </span>582 BR 619 (Bankr D Del, 2018) (an Italian debt restructuring plan).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In contrast, the position in the UK is much more conservative and circumscribed with regard to interpreting the UK equivalent of Art 21 of the Model Law. The relevant provision is found in Schedule 1 to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No 1030) (UK), and provides as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Article 21.

In <span class="font-italic">Rubin (UKSC)</span>, it was argued by the respondent that the recognition and enforcement of foreign-insolvency judgments was one of the reliefs available under Art 21 of the UK Model Law, and the fact that “recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is not specifically mentioned in article 21 as one of the forms of relief available, does not mean that such relief cannot be granted” (at [141]). Thus, the foreign representatives of TCT sought enforcement of a judgment by the US bankruptcy court in respect of fraudulent conveyances and transfers against Eurofinance SA and others. However, the UK Supreme Court rejected that submission on the basis that the UK Model Law “say[s] nothing about the enforcement of foreign judgments” and it “would be surprising if the Model Law was intended to deal with judgments in insolvency matters” when no consensus could even be reached regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters which had been the subject of intense international negotiations at the Hague Conference on Private International Law (at [142]–[143]).

It is also observed that in an attempt to get around the decision of the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Rubin (UKSC)</span>, the UNCITRAL Working Group V drafted a proposed model law to allow for the recognition of foreign insolvency judgments, especially if the judgment comes from the jurisdiction of the debtor’s COMI (Neil Hannan, <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency: The Enactment and Interpretation of the UNCITRAL Model Law </span>(Springer, 2017) at p 244).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In this regard, the Applicant submits that the UK’s position should not be adopted.

</div> In the draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 that the Ministry of Law sought public consultation on, the draft Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law provided that the reliefs available included “any additional relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder <span class="font-italic">under the law of Singapore</span>” [emphasis added]. However, in the final version of the Model Law, the italicised phrase was deleted. This was intentionally done in order to align the Singapore position with that of the US, rather than the UK, as observed from the Ministry’s Response to Feedback from Public Consultation on the Draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring <https: annex_a-goverment_<br="" files="" www.mlaw.gov.sg=""></https:>Response_to_Public%20Consult_Feedback_for_Companies_Act_Amendments.pdf/&gt; (accessed 24 May 2022):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.2.1 In respect of Art 21(1)(g), we received a comment that despite similar wording in their respective provisions, the UK and US differ in their approaches on the scope of relief that may be granted. It was therefore suggested that Singapore should signal whether the US or UK approach should be adopted in respect of relief that may be granted under Art 21(1)(g).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11.2.2 After consideration of this issue, the suggestion has been noted and accepted.

From the above passage, it is clear that the Ministry of Law was concerned with the “scope of relief that may be granted” under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Singapore Model Law, and has expressly chosen to align the language of the provision with that under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In the circumstances, the US approach should be preferred and it is the US jurisprudence which should be persuasive in determining the scope of relief to be granted. The holding in <span class="font-italic">Rubin (UKSC)</span> is not endorsed in Singapore and I decline to follow the English authorities that depart from the US position. I accept the Applicant’s arguments that the Singapore court is empowered under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law to grant recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order as foreign orders, following the proposition found in the US authorities. I do not consider that the difference in the language of the enacting provisions in the US and Singapore makes a substantial difference. While § 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code contains the additional phrase “to effectuate the purpose of this chapter” (see above at [71]), the difference is not material. This is because the purpose of Chapter 15 is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with the objectives stated in the preamble to our Model Law. Additionally, while the version of Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) enacted in Singapore contains the modifier “available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder” after “any additional relief” (see above at [77]), I do not read Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) to be so restricted, in line with the Ministry of Law’s comments that the scope of relief that may be granted should follow the US approach and the US provisions contain a similar modifier. This also follows from the fact that the phrase “under the law of Singapore” was eventually removed, which signifies that an expansive view is to be taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The section heading of Art 21(1) of the Model Law contains the phrase “any appropriate relief”. Invoking the section heading alone would circumvent the issue that the enforcement of a foreign rehabilitation plan is not ordinarily “relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder” under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law. I do note that in the unreported case of <span class="font-italic">Re CFG Peru Investments Pte Ltd and another</span> HC/OS 665/2021 (21 September 2021), the Singapore High Court recognised a US Chapter 11 plan and the accompanying confirmation order under the Model Law but did not specify whether the relief was granted under the section heading of Art 21(1) or Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Nevertheless, Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law can be read as an extension of Art 21(1) and the principles governing the reliefs available apply equally to both. Little distinction is made by the US courts. In <span class="font-italic">re Oi SA</span> (at 265), the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York considered that the reliefs available under § 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code (the equivalent of Art 21(1) of the Singapore Model law) encompass the reliefs available under § 1521(a)(7) (the equivalent of Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Singapore Model Law):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 1521(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that ‘[u]pon recognition of a foreign proceeding, ... where necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief....’ 11 U.S.C. § 1521(a). Such ‘appropriate relief’ includes a non-exhaustive list of certain types of relief that is enumerated by the statute, including ‘any additional relief that may be available to a trustee, except for relief available under sections 522, 544, 545, 547, 548, 550, and 724(a).’ 11 U.S.C. § 1521(a)(7). …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, in <span class="font-italic">re Oi SA </span>(at 266), the recognition of the Brazilian reorganisation plan (known as the “recuperação judicial plan”) and the Brazilian court order confirming the plan was granted as “‘appropriate relief’ under Section 1521(a)(7)”, even though the language of “appropriate relief” is found only in the chapeau of § 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code. Following the reasoning in that case, the relief in the present application can be granted pursuant to Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 However, in granting recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency judgments and orders, the Singapore court is not merely acting as a rubber stamp. Following the guidance laid down in <span class="font-italic">re CG</span><span class="font-italic">G SA</span> (see above at [73]), the Singapore court must carefully scrutinise the circumstances in which the foreign order was granted and ensure that interested parties were given an opportunity to be heard and that the relevant creditors and shareholders are adequately protected. This requirement is encapsulated in Art 22(1) of the Model Law which provides that in granting relief under Art 21, the court must be satisfied that the interests of the creditors and other interested persons, including if appropriate the debtor, are “adequately protected”. As elaborated upon in the UNCITRAL 2013 Guide (at para 196), the “idea underlying article 22 is that there should be a balance between relief that may be granted to the foreign representative and the interests of the persons that may be affected by such relief”. Adequate protection must be afforded to interested parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Turning to the present circumstances, I note that the Chapter 11 process, leading up to the approval of the Confirmation Order endorsing the Chapter 11 Plan, was conducted under the supervision of and with the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court.

</div> The Applicant informs that he has not received any notice from any creditor of any objection to this present application. Thus, I find that the interests of relevant parties are adequately protected. The recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order is therefore granted as appropriate additional relief under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law in relation to S1 and S2.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Common law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As has been noted in a number of instances, I am reluctant to invoke common law recognition where it would seem to have been contemplated that the Model Law would govern the proceedings, either by allowing or prohibiting a particular result. Where the Model Law is applicable to the subject matter, the court would be slow to allow common law recognition to be invoked as an alternative basis as the existence of a detailed recognition regime created by legislation displaces the need for the common law doctrine to apply (<span class="font-italic">Re Rooftop</span> at [58]). In the present case, the Applicant’s request for recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation, at least in relation to S1 and S2, is governed by the Model Law, as is apparent from my conclusion above at [83]. Thus, in relation to S1 and S2, common law recognition would not be available. I do not deal with the alternate submissions made by the Applicant on this front.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As regards EH-REIT, some form of common law recognition would probably be required, given my finding at [30] above that the Model Law does <span class="font-italic">not </span>apply to entities such as EH-REIT. However, I am doubtful whether any application for common law recognition can be pursued without the joining of the EH-REIT Trustee, as I elaborate below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relief in respect of the EH-REIT Trustee and common law recognition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 What is sought by the Applicant is authorisation for the EH-REIT Trustee (namely, DBS Trustee Limited) to take steps to wind down the entity. In my judgment, this should be done in a separate application with the relevant supporting affidavit. The recognition of the Applicant as the foreign representative and the recognition of the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings does not absolve DBS Trustee Limited from exercising its duties and responsibilities as the EH-REIT Trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I cannot see how the Applicant could also have the standing to make an application on behalf of DBS Trustee Limited. If obligations are owed under Singapore law, which presumably they are, DBS Trustee Limited should satisfy the Singapore court that the winding down and other steps contemplated are in accordance with Singapore law, and that it is satisfied, as the EH-REIT Trustee, that these are appropriate under the terms of the trust deed. DBS Trustee Limited must also demonstrate to the court that no prejudice will be occasioned to the Stapled Security Holders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Furthermore, I cannot see how any matters affecting the winding down of EH-REIT could be brought in this summons: the winding down of a trust is not covered by the empowering act, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> the IRDA, and is outside the scope of the Model Law as enacted in Singapore. While there is express provision made for business trusts to be wound up in Singapore under the BTA (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by order of court), there is no such equivalent provision under the SFA for collective investment schemes, such as EH-REIT, that are authorised under it. The dissolution of EH-REIT would have to be done in accordance with the terms of the trust deed, which would specify details such as the manner in which the assets are to be sold and how the remaining assets (if any) are to be distributed to the various unitholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It may be that a separate application will add to the complexity of the process of implementing the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order, but that is what our legal framework requires. I cannot give orders for DBS Trustee Limited to liquidate EH-REIT in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Common law recognition may possibly be available for the recognition of the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings in relation to EH-REIT. The common law test may have to be applied instead (see <span class="font-italic">Re Opti-Medix Ltd (in liquidation) and another matter</span> [2016] 4 SLR 312). But no comment is made on whether such an application would succeed under common law recognition, and this issue will be determined at the appropriate juncture. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other reliefs sought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In relation to the additional relief sought above at [4(a)]–[4(b)], I do not find that controversial issues are raised and will grant them, save that these are limited to S1 and S2 only (instead of all the Singapore Chapter 11 Entities including EH-REIT).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The prayer at [4(a)] is sought so that the Applicant can be properly authorised by the Singapore courts as a “foreign representative” under Art 2(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Model Law to perform his duties and obligations set out under the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order. The UNCITRAL 2013 Guide provides (at para 86) that the “fact of appointment of the foreign representative in the foreign proceeding … is sufficient for the purposes of the Model Law” and the definition of a “foreign representative” is “sufficiently broad to include debtors who remain in possession after the commencement of insolvency proceedings”. The Applicant was duly appointed by the US Bankruptcy Court to be the foreign representative of S1 and S2 on 21 January 2021 in relation to the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings.

The analysis for recognition under the Model Law was only proceeded with for S1 and S2: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[31]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[32]</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings should be recognised as foreign main proceeding even though the presumptive COMI is in Singapore</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Chapter 11 Proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code were clearly “foreign proceeding[s]” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law, as noted in previous cases. Rather, the key issue was whether the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings should be recognised as foreign main proceedings or foreign non-main proceedings: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">33]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The starting point was that the COMI of S1 and S2 was presumed to be Singapore pursuant to Art 16(3) of the Model Law as they were both incorporated in and have registered offices in Singapore. However, this presumption may be displaced by other factors on the presence of proof to the contrary: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">36]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[37]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Both S1 and S2 were not active, operational companies. Rather, they were part of the Eagle Hospitality Group, which has its main business operations and assets based in the US. The substantial assets consisting of the portfolio of 18 full-service Hotels were all located in the US where the income would be derived as well. Further, the significant creditors of S1 and S2 were based in the US, and the governing law of the various agreements with the creditors was US law. In the circumstances, the presumption under Art 16(3) of the Model Law has been displaced and the COMI for both S1 and S2 was the US: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">39]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The fact that the Singapore Entities’ Chapter 11 Proceedings were ongoing in the US was irrelevant in determining the COMI, as were the activities of the foreign representative. The work being done by the foreign representee would flow from the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign court: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">45]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[50]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Basis of recognition</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 While the court was previously amenable to taking an expanded view of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law, the court opined that the better course was to grant recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order under Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Model Law instead. Nevertheless, some views in passing regarding Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Model Law were set out and the issue was left open for future determination: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">56]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 While the Model Law does not explicitly provide for the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency orders and judgments, the list of reliefs in Art 21 of the Model law was non-exhaustive in nature and the court was not restricted unnecessarily in its ability to grant any type of relief that was required in the circumstances of the case: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[68]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Within the US cases, it was well-established in Chapter 15 jurisprudence that foreign insolvency orders and judgments may be recognised and enforced locally. The US equivalent of Art 21 of the Model Law has been interpreted to extend to the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency-related orders and judgments confirming foreign reorganisation plans. In contrast, the position in the United Kingdom (the “UK”) was much more circumscribed with regard to interpreting the UK equivalent of Art 21 of the Model Law, and the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency judgments was not permitted: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">70]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[71]</span> and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [75]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The US approach should be preferred over the UK approach. The Ministry of Law has expressed its preference for the US approach and has intentionally amended the language of Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) to align the Singapore position with that of the US. Thus, the US jurisprudence should be persuasive in determining the scope of relief to be granted: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">77] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">78]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 In granting recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency judgments and orders, the Singapore court was not merely acting as a rubber stamp. The Singapore court must carefully scrutinise the circumstances in which the foreign order was granted and ensure that interested parties were adequately protected. There was adequate protection for the relevant parties in the present circumstances as the Chapter 11 process was supervised by the US Bankruptcy Court, the requisite voting requirements for the confirmation of the Chapter 11 Plan were properly satisfied, and there was opportunity provided for creditors to be heard. The Singapore creditors were also duly notified about the developments in the Chapter 11 process. All creditors were notified of the present recognition proceedings: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[81]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relief in respect of the EH-REIT Trustee and common law recognition</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The Applicant did not have the standing to make an application on behalf of DBS Trustee Limited. Instead, DBS Trustee Limited should satisfy the Singapore court that the winding down and other steps contemplated were in accordance with Singapore law and the trust deed. The court could not see how any matters affecting the winding down of EH-REIT could be brought in this summons. A separate application should be made in respect of EH-REIT: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">87]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">88]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[95]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other reliefs sought</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The additional relief sought by the Applicant (except that concerning DBS Trustee Limited) was granted as these were uncontroversial, save that these are limited to S1 and S2 only: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">91]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
