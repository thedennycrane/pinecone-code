<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case raises novel and interesting issues of
                    statutory construction relating to the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court.
                    It concerns the arrest of a vessel owned by a company which had agreed to
                    guarantee the liabilities of a related company as charterer under a separate and
                    independent charterparty. The dispute requires an examination of the scope of
                    the “sister ship” arrest rule and in particular whether a ship
                    owned by a guarantor can constitute a “sister ship” for the
                    purpose of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev
                    Ed) (“HCAJA”). Specifically it would entail an examination of two
                    issues:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether a claim under a guarantee would be a
                            claim arising out of an agreement relating to the use or hire of a
                            vessel; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the party who would be liable in personam
                            under the guarantee was in possession or in control of the vessel at the
                            time when the cause of action arose.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Over the last 50 years or so since the
                    International Convention Relating to the Arrest of Seagoing Ships (“the
                    1952 Arrest Convention”) came into force in 1952, the provisions of the
                    HCAJA and its equivalent in other jurisdictions such as the UK, Hong Kong and
                    Australia have been the subject of intense judicial scrutiny. It has generated
                    numerous judicial decisions on the scope and width of the right of arrest.
                    During this period, the law on this area has never been static and is constantly
                    evolving. To illustrate the dynamic nature of admiralty law, at one time it was
                    decided by none other than the House of Lords that the “sister
                    ship” arrest rule was only restricted to ships in common ownership by the
                    same defendant: see <em>The Eschersheim</em> [1976]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 1 (“<em>The
                        Eschersheim”</em>). The Court of Appeal in <em>The Permina 108</em> [1977] 1 MLJ 49 (“<em>The Permina 108</em>”) declined to follow <em>The Eschersheim</em> when it allowed the arrest of a vessel
                    owned by a charterer even though it had no common ownership with the vessel
                    under which the cause of action arose. Eventually, other jurisdictions including
                    the UK adopted The <em>Permina 108</em> in preference to
                        <em>The Eschersheim</em>: see the UK decision in
                        <em>The Span Terza</em> [1982] 1 Lloyd’s Rep
                    225, the Hong Kong decision in <em>The Sextum</em> [1982]
                    HKLR 356, and the New Zealand decision in <em>The Fua
                        Kavenga</em> [1987] 1 NZLR 550 (“<em>The
                        Fua Kavenga</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The evolving nature of this branch of the law is
                    hardly surprising given that the right of arrest in the hands of creditors can
                    be an effective tool (in many instances the only way) to secure payment and the
                    use of the ship (free from arrest) is the principal source to generate operating
                    income for the owners. Shipowners and claimants are therefore constantly seeking
                    to re-define the boundaries. However, the two issues before me have not
                    specifically been the subject of judicial pronouncement by the courts in any of
                    the leading maritime nations. The only decision which has dealt with a similar
                    situation was the decision of the High Court of New Zealand in <em>The Fua Kavenga</em>. For the reasons set out below, I have
                    declined to follow it. On close scrutiny of <em>The Fua
                        Kavenga</em>, although the case concerned the right of arrest of a
                    vessel arising from a similar claim under a guarantee, the two issues before me
                    were not specifically considered. Having said that, even if they had been
                    considered, I would nonetheless have arrived at the same outcome. In the result,
                    I set aside the writ of summons and, consequently, the arrest of the vessel. I
                    now give my reasons for so doing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff is the registered owner of the
                    vessel <em>Mahakam</em>. The defendant is PT Humpuss
                    Intermoda Transportasi Tbk (“HIT”), a company incorporated and
                    registered under the laws of Indonesia and has been listed on the Jakarta Stock
                    Exchange since 24 November 1997. It is also listed on the Surabaya Stock
                    Exchange.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement dated
                    11 December 2007, the plaintiff purchased the <em>Mahakam</em> from Heritage Maritime Ltd, SA
                    (“Heritage”) for a total consideration of US$67m. On the same day,
                    pursuant to a Bareboat Charterparty (“Bareboat C/P”) under an
                    amended BARECON 2001 form, the <em>Mahakam</em> was leased
                    back by the plaintiff to Heritage for a period of 60 months. Essentially, this
                    was a sale and lease back arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It was a condition precedent under the Bareboat
                    C/P for HIT to execute a guarantee in favour of the plaintiff to secure the due
                    performance and payment of Heritage’s obligations under the charterparty.
                    Clause 36 of the Bareboat C/P provides, inter alia, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Charter, the obligation
                        of the Owners to charter the Vessel to the Charterers under this Charter is
                        subject to and conditional upon the following (other than Clause 36.14) and
                        the obligation of the Charterers to take the Vessel on charter from the
                        Owners under this Charter is subject to and conditional upon Clauses 36.11,
                        36.13 and 36.14 being true and accurate at the Delivery Date:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.11 each of the
                            parties thereto having executed and delivered in agreed
                        form:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">36.11.1 the Sellers’ Credit Agreement; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">36.11.2 the Charter Assignment together with the duly signed notice of
                            assignment from the Charterers to any sub-charterer</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">36.11.3 <em>the duly executed guarantee to be provided
                                by the Guarantor</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The guarantee was duly executed by HIT on
                    11 December 2007, the same day the Bareboat C/P was signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Heritage is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humpuss
                    Sea Transport Pte Ltd (“HST”), a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. HST is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of HIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Under the terms of the Bareboat C/P, Heritage
                    agreed and/or undertook, <em>inter alia</em>, to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">pay charterhire at US$38,500 per day monthly in
                            advance on the first day of every calendar month;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">maintain and repair the <em>Mahakam;</em></div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">keep the <em>Mahakam</em>
                            insured; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">pay interest on such charterhire from the date of
                            such failure to the date of actual payment at the rate of 2% above
                            LIBOR.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Pursuant to the Bareboat C/P, the <em>Mahakam</em> was delivered to Heritage on 13 December
                    2007. Thereafter, the charterparty proceeded without any significant incident
                    until April 2009. On 16 April 2009, Heritage defaulted on the payment of
                    the charterhire. Heritage failed to pay charterhire for the period from
                    16 April 2009 till 15 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 22 June 2009, the plaintiff issued a
                    notice to Heritage to terminate the Bareboat C/P pursuant to cl. 46.2. The
                    notice of termination required Heritage to redeliver the <em>Mahakam</em> to the plaintiff and it was so redelivered on
                    23 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other legal proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After Heritage defaulted on the Bareboat C/P,
                    the plaintiff commenced various proceedings against HIT, HST and Heritage. In
                    May 2009, the plaintiff commenced an action in New York against Heritage and HIT
                    seeking damages for breach of the Bareboat C/P. In the New York proceedings, the
                    plaintiff obtained an <em>ex-parte</em> order to restrain
                    Heritage and HIT from dealing with property in the hands of specific garnishee
                    intermediary banks up to a limit of US$2,247,117.72. This attachment is commonly
                    referred to as the Rule B Order. However, the total sum which was attached
                    pursuant to the New York Rule B Order was only US$352,500.44.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In June 2009 the plaintiff obtained a further
                    Rule B Order in Connecticut against HIT, HST, Heritage and Genuine Maritime
                    Limited, which is another wholly-owned subsidiary of HST. The sum actually
                    caught by the Connecticut Rule B Order amounted to only US$70,000. Arising from
                    the severe downturn in the freight market, many banks in New York were inundated
                    with multiple Rule B Orders on a daily basis. In October 2009, the Second
                    Circuit Court of Appeals of the Southern District of New York issued its
                    decision in <em>Shipping Corporation of India v Jaldhi Pte
                        Ltd</em>. 585 F.3d 58, 71 (2d Cir.2009). The court held that Rule B
                    Orders are not available to attach electronic fund transfers in the possession
                    of intermediary banks for processing. Arising from this decision, many New York
                    Rule B Orders have since been discharged. Indeed on 8 December 2009, the
                    New York Rule B Order which was obtained by the plaintiff against HIT and
                    Heritage was set aside. However, the Connecticut Rule B Order remains in
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 12 June 2009, the plaintiff arrested
                    the <em>Mahakam</em> in Malaysia in respect of their claim
                    against Heritage under the Bareboat C/P. The <em>Mahakam</em> was eventually redelivered to the plaintiff and she was
                    released from arrest on 24 June 2009. It was agreed between the plaintiff
                    and Heritage that the claim under the Bareboat C/P would be referred to
                    arbitration in London pursuant to cl 30 and 54 of the Bareboat C/P. Indeed
                    on or about 31 August 2009, the plaintiff served their Points of Claim
                    against Heritage for unpaid charterhire under the Bareboat C/P in the London
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Invocation of admiralty jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 5 September 2009, the plaintiff arrested
                    the <em>Catur Samudra</em> in the present proceedings. It
                    is not in dispute that the <em>Catur Samudra</em> is owned
                    by HIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is clear from the indorsement of claim that
                    the plaintiff’s claim against HIT in this action is solely under the
                    guarantee dated 11 December 2007 for payment of outstanding charterhire due
                    and owing by Heritage and for damages for breaches of the Bareboat C/P. The
                    total amount claimed is stated to be US$30,777,566.44.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court
                    has been invoked by the plaintiff against the <em>Catur
                        Samudra</em> on the following basis:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s claim against
                        HIT under the guarantee is brought under s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA being a claim arising out of an agreement
                        relating to the use or hire of the <em>Mahakam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     At the time when the cause of action arose against HIT under the
                        guarantee, HIT was in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 14 October 2009, HIT filed an
                    application for, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                    orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the writ of summons filed in this action be

                    admiralty jurisdiction was wrongly invoked against the <em>Catur
                        Samudra</em>. Specifically, HIT’s jurisdictional challenge was
                    premised on two grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff’s claim under the guarantee
                            does not fall within s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel for HIT confirmed that they were not
                    relying on non-disclosure or that the writ of summons did not disclose any
                    reasonable or arguable cause of action. However, it was apparent that the
                    plaintiff was not aware prior to the hearing that HIT was no longer relying on
                    these two alternative arguments. The plaintiff had prepared extensive
                    submissions to deal with both points. It is good practice and professional
                    courtesy to inform the opposing party in advance of the hearing if a party
                    should decide to abandon any point or issue which arises from the application.
                    This practice should be encouraged as it will save time and costs for all
                    parties including the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Burden of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is well settled and not in dispute that the
                    burden of proof is on the plaintiff to satisfy all the jurisdictional
                    requirements laid down in s 4(4) of the HCAJA in order to successfully
                    invoke the admiralty jurisdiction against the <em>Catur
                        Samudra</em>: see <em>The Maritime Trader</em>
                    [1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 153 (“<em>The Maritime
                        Trader</em>”) at 157 and <em>The Andres

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is also trite that the plaintiff must
                    satisfy the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities: see <em>The Aventicum</em> [1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 184 at 190

                    the question of admiralty jurisdiction must be decided based on the affidavit
                    evidence before the court and should not be tried as an issue (save for
                    exceptional circumstances which do not apply here):</p>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The claim is mentioned in section 3 (1) (d)

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The claim arises in connection with the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The person who would be liable on the claim in an
                            action in personam (referred to in this subsection as the relevant
                            person) was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or charterer of,
                            or in possession or in control of, the ship;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">At the time when the action is brought, the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As regards sub-para (a), HIT denies that the
                    claim under the guarantee falls within s 3(1)(<em>h</em>). There is no dispute that the requirements under sub-paras
                    (b) and (d) are satisfied. As regards sub-para (c), this condition may be
                    further broken into two sub-conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_i"></a>(i)     That the person proceeded against,
                            <em>ie</em>, HIT, must either be the owner or
                        charterer of, or in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em> at the time when the cause of action arose. The
                        plaintiff alleged that HIT was in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em>. This is disputed by HIT;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     That HIT is the person who would be
                        liable to the plaintiff under the guarantee in an action in personam. This
                        requirement is not disputed since HIT was indeed the party who executed the
                        guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First issue - Whether the plaintiff’s claim under the guarantee
                issued by HIT would be a claim arising out of an agreement relating to the
                charterparty in respect of the <em>Mahakam</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the plaintiff advanced the
                    following arguments that the claim under the guarantee falls within the scope of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The provisions of the HCAJA
                        including s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) are to be given a

                        <em>The Antonis P Lemos</em> [1985] AC 711
                            (“<em>The Antonis P

                            Mara</em> [2000] 4 SLR 156 (“<em>The Mara</em> “) were cited in support.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     The guarantee issued by HIT would
                        constitute an agreement relating to the charterparty of the <em>Mahakam</em> as the provision of the guarantee was stated
                        to be a condition precedent to the Bareboat C/P. Initially, <em>The Fua Kavenga</em> was cited in support. Subsequently,
                        the decision of the Federal Court of Canada, <em>National
                            Bank Leasing v Merlac Marine Inc</em> (1992) 52 Federal Trial
                        Reports 15 (“<em>National Bank
                        Leasing</em>”) was also cited in aid of this
                        construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Bareboat C/P in respect of the <em>Mahakam</em>
                        was specifically referred to in the guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the other hand, counsel for HIT put forward
                    the following rival contentions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     There are two connecting phrases in
                            s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA. While
                        “arising out of” has been given a wide and liberal
                        construction, the other connecting phrase “relating to” is
                        more relevant. The courts have consistently applied a narrow and restricted
                        interpretation of the phrase “relating to”. <em>The Fua Kavenga</em> should not be followed since the court did
                        not address this vital difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The guarantee was for the financial protection of the
                        plaintiff and was strictly unnecessary for the use or hire of the <em>Mahakam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     The identification of the <em>Mahakam</em> in the guarantee is not
                decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Section 3(1)(<em>h</em>)
                    of the HCAJA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.—(1) The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court shall be as
                        follows, that is to say, jurisdiction to hear and determine any of the

                            or to the use or hire of a ship; [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is apparent that there are two connecting
                    phrases which govern the proper construction of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>), <em>ie</em>, “arising out
                    of” and “relating to”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Effect of the expression “arising out of”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For many years, it was considered to be
                    settled law that a claim in tort falls within the UK equivalent of
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>): see <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> [1957] P 179 at 183:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he words…are…wide enough to cover claims whether in
                        contract or in tort arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of
                        goods in a ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     About 30 years later, counsel for the
                    shipowners, Mark Saville QC (now Lord Saville) in <em>The Antonis
                        P Lemos</em> sought to venture into unchartered waters in submitting
                    that s 20(2)(<em>h</em>) of the UK Supreme Court Act
                    1981 (in <em>pari materia</em> with s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA) only applied to claims of a purely
                    contractual nature. After reviewing the relevant authorities, the House of Lords
                    in <em>The Antonis P Lemos</em> held that the expression
                    “arising out of” should be given its wider meaning of
                    “connected with” and not the narrower meaning of “arising
                    under”. In <em>The Antonis P Lemos</em>, the claim
                    was brought by the sub-sub-charterer against the shipowner in the tort of
                    negligence for failing to ensure that the draft of the vessel did not exceed 32
                    feet upon arrival at the port of discharge which thereby caused additional
                    expenses to lighten the vessel. Accordingly, the effect of the holding is that
                        s 20(2)(<em>h</em>) of the UK Act is wide enough
                    to encompass a claim in tort even though there was no direct contractual
                    relationship between the sub-sub charterer and the shipowner. However, it is
                    relevant to highlight that in <em>The Antonio P Lemos</em>,
                    the claim in tort arose from a sub-sub charter. There can be no dispute that a
                    sub-sub-charter like any other charterparty is an agreement relating to the use
                    or hire of a vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     
          <em>The Mara</em> and
                        <em>The Indriani</em> cited by the plaintiff do not
                    assist either. In both cases, the courts were concerned with the interpretation
                    of the expression “arising out of”. In <em>The
                        Mara</em>, the Court of Appeal held that a claim for contractual
                    compensation in respect of personal injuries payable under a collective
                    agreement was a claim arising out of loss of life or personal injury under
                        s 3(1)(<em>f</em>) of the HCAJA. In <em>The Indriani</em>, consistent with the broad and liberal
                    application of “arising out of” under s 3(1)(<em>h</em>), the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the
                    lower court that a claim for malicious falsehood arising from the issuance of a
                    clean bill of lading was a claim arising out of an agreement relating to the use
                    or hire of a vessel. It could hardly be disputed that a claim under a bill of
                    lading was indeed a claim arising out of an agreement relating to the use or
                    hire of the vessel. While the courts have leaned towards a broad interpretation
                    of the expression “arising out of” to enlarge the types of claims
                    as falling within s 3(1)(<em>h</em>), they have,
                    however, adopted a narrow interpretation to restrict the claims only under
                    agreements which are in themselves related to the use or hire of a
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ambit of the expression “relating to” – Direct
                Connection Test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the present case, counsel for the defendant
                    rightly focussed on the more relevant expression “relating to”.
                    The House of Lord in <em>Gatoil International Inc v
                        Arkwright-Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co</em> [1985] AC 255
                        (“<em>The Sandrina</em>”) reviewed the
                    previous authorities and formulated the test that to constitute “an
                    agreement relating to the use or hire of a ship” the agreement must have
                    some “reasonably direct connection with such activities” (at 271).
                    In <em>The Sandrina</em>, the contract of insurance
                    arranged by the shipowner for cargo shipped onboard the vessel was found to lack
                    the “direct connection” and hence outside the ambit of
                        s 20(2)(<em>h</em>) of the UK act. For the same
                    reason, an agreement for salvage services in <em>The
                        Eschersheim</em> was found to fall within the UK equivalent of
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) because the rendering of
                    salvage services directly involved the use of a salvage vessel Similarly, the
                    agreement for mooring and unmooring services in <em>The Queen of
                        the South</em> [1968] 1 All ER 1163 (“<em>The
                        Queen of the South</em>”) directly involved the use of motor
                    boats in providing the services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In deciding on the scope of the expression
                    “relating to”, it is useful to refer to decisions where claims
                    which have some appearance of a connection with the use or hire of a vessel were
                    nevertheless held to fall outside the equivalent of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>The
                            Tesaba</em> [1982] 1 Lloyd's Rep 397 (“<em>The Tesaba”)</em>, the claim by the salvors
                        against the shipowner was for failure to use best endeavours to ensure that
                        cargo interests provide security prior to the release of the cargo in breach
                        of the salvage agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>The Sandrina</em>, the claim
                        was by the cargo insurers for unpaid premiums for insurance arranged by the
                        shipowner on the cargo carried onboard the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>The
                            Aifanourios</em> (1980) SC 346 <em>(“The Aifanourios”)</em>, the claim was by the
                        P&amp;I insurers for unpaid release calls in respect of the vessel payable
                        by the shipowner.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>The Bumbesti</em> [1999]
                        2 Lloyd’s Rep 481 (“<em>The
                            Bumbesti”)</em>, the claim was to enforce an arbitration
                        award arising from a breach of a charterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_e"></a>(e)     Finally, a claim for outstanding hire payable
                        under an agreement for the hire of containers previously held to be within
                        the equivalent of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) in <em>The Sonia S</em> [1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 63
                        was observed in <em>The Sandrina</em> to have been
                        wrongly decided and should be overruled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In each of the above cases, the claims were
                    made under agreements which by themselves were not agreements relating to the
                    use or hire of a vessel. This is to be contrasted with <em>The
                        Eschersheim</em> and <em>The Queen of the
                        South</em> where the claims were based on agreements which directly
                    related to the use or hire of a vessel. In the present case, the guarantee is
                    not an agreement which in itself relates to the use or hire of the <em>Mahakam</em>. The sole purpose of the guarantee was to
                    provide financial protection to the plaintiff against the risk of default by
                    Heritage under the Bareboat C/P. In similar vein, in <em>The
                        Aifanourios</em>, although it was clear that the insurance of a vessel
                    is a matter directed to the convenience and protection of the owner, it was held
                    to be outside the scope of the equivalent of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) because it was “... not essential for the operation of
                    the vessel as such” (per Lord Wylie at 350). Equally, in each of these
                    cases, the claims were based on separate agreements which were one step removed
                    from the agreement for the use or hire of a vessel. The claims were based on
                    agreements which were <em>indirectly</em> related to the
                    use or hire of the vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This is consistent with the approach adopted
                    by Aikens J in <em>The Bumbesti</em> at 487 –
                    488:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) However, that <b><em>agreement to refer disputes is not,
                            itself, an “agreement in relation to the use or hire of a
                            ship</em></b><b>”</b>. This is because
                        the arbitration agreement, whether it is the individual reference or the
                        general agreement to refer, is a contract that is distinct from the
                        principal contract, i.e. the bareboat charter-party in this
                        case…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) … The agreement to refer to arbitration individual disputes
                        that have arisen out of a charter-party, or the agreement to refer future
                        disputes in general that arise out of a charter-party, must be agreements
                        that are <em>indirectly</em> “in relation to the
                        use or hire of a ship”. But, in my view, they are not agreements that
                        are <em>sufficiently directly</em> “in relation
                        to the use or hire of a ship”

                        award made pursuant to the agreement to refer disputes. In my view the
                        breach of the contract relied on when suing on an award does not have the
                        “reasonably direct connection with” the use or hire of the
                        ship that Lord Keith held in the <em>Gatoil</em> case
                        was necessary to found jurisdiction...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff relied on the fact that under
                    the Bareboat C/P, it was a condition precedent for HIT to execute the guarantee.
                    On this basis, it was submitted that the guarantee must be an agreement relating
                    to the Bareboat C/P since without the guarantee, there would have been no
                    Bareboat C/P of the <em>Mahakam</em>. In my view, an
                    agreement which in itself is not an agreement intrinsically related to the use
                    or hire of a vessel cannot be transformed into such an agreement simply by
                    characterising it as a term or condition precedent of the charterparty. This
                    would have the effect of altering the “direct connection” test
                    into a “but for” test. If such a test is to be adopted, it would
                    mean that an agreement for example to lease a building or to sell shares in a
                    company which are framed as condition precedents to a charterparty would
                        <em>ipso facto</em> become an agreement relating to the
                    use or hire of a vessel. Such a submission would enlarge the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the High Court to cover claims which were never contemplated to
                    have the right of arrest. Similarly, it is not uncommon for shipowners to insist
                    on the incorporation of an arbitration agreement in the charterparty. In this
                    way, it could be said that “but for” the arbitration agreement,
                    the shipowner would not enter into the charterparty. However, as pointed out in
                        <em>The Bumbesti</em>, a claim to enforce an
                    arbitration award arising out of the charterparty is at best a claim which is
                        <em>indirectly</em> related to the use or hire of the
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the course of the hearing before me, I
                    enquired from counsel for the plaintiff whether there is any authority that a
                    claim brought under a collateral or separate agreement independent of the
                    charterparty or bill of lading has been held to fall within
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>). Initially, The <em>Fua Kavenga</em> was the only authority cited. Subsequently
                    after the hearing and before I rendered my oral judgment, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel also cited <em>National Bank Leasing</em> in their
                    further arguments. In setting aside the writ and the warrant of arrest, I
                    informed the parties that I will explain why I have declined to follow these two
                    decisions in my written grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>The Fua
                        Kavenga</em>, the court dealt with several issues of admiralty
                    jurisdiction in addition to sovereign immunity and <em>res
                        judicata</em>. The main discussion on admiralty jurisdiction was
                    whether New Zealand should adopt the UK approach of “sister ship”
                    arrest in <em>The Eschersheim</em> or the Singapore
                    position in <em>The Permina 108</em>. After analysing the
                    conflicting views, the court preferred and adopted <em>The
                        Permina 108</em>. Smellie J referred to <em>The
                        Antonis P Lemos</em> that the expression “arising out
                    of” (which is found in the New Zealand equivalent in s 4(1) of the
                    Admiralty Act, 1973) is to be construed widely as “connected
                    with”. Although <em>The Sandrina</em> was also
                    cited, there was no analysis in the judgment why despite the narrow
                    interpretation of the relevant expression “relating to”, the claim
                    under the guarantee was nevertheless found to be a claim relating to the use or
                    hire of a vessel. This was not disputed by counsel for the plaintiff during the
                    hearing. It seems to me that Smellie J after citing <em>The
                        Antonis P Lemos</em> as authority for the wide interpretation of the
                    expression “arising out of” assumed that the broad interpretation
                    should govern the entire sub-section without addressing how that was to be
                    reconciled with the narrower expression of “relating
                to”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>National Bank
                        Leasing</em>, the Federal Court of Canada had to consider whether a
                    claim under a Guarantee Bond which guaranteed the performance of a charterer
                    fell within its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Federal Court held that it had
                    jurisdiction because the claim arose out of an agreement relating to the use or
                    hire of a ship by charterparty within the meaning of s 22(2)(<em>i</em>) of the Federal Court Act, RSC 1985. It is apparent
                    that the Canadian provision is practically identical to s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA. In arriving at its decision, the
                    Federal Court did not refer to and consequently did not consider any of the
                    leading UK authorities on point. Instead, the Federal Court, after referring to
                    the statement of claim that “the possible liability of the
                    defendant… under the Lease Guarantee Bond [arises] out of the
                    default...under the charterparty”, held that the claim “arises out
                    of an agreement (the Lease Guarantee Bond) relating to the use or hire of a ship
                    (as governed by the charterparty)”(at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>). The Federal Court also observed that the claim under the
                    Lease Guarantee Bond was inseparably linked to the charterparty. This appears to
                    be akin to the “but for” test. The decision was therefore bereft
                    of any serious analysis of the relevant narrow expression “relating
                    to” and does not provide any useful assistance to the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Australian approach of the “direct
                    connection” test in <em>Port of Geelong Authority v The
                        Bass Reefer</em> (1992) Federal Court Reports 374 (“<em>The Bass Reefer</em>”) is instructive. In that case,
                    the plaintiff port authority, entered into a leasing agreement with the
                    defendant shipowner. Under the agreement, the plaintiff agreed to provide some
                    land for the defendant’s ships to handle container cargo and a priority
                    berthing licence to the defendant. The plaintiff brought an in rem claim against
                    the defendant’s ship for outstanding fees under the agreement. The court
                    held that both claims fell outside the ambit of the equivalent
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>). It held at 381 to 382:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I ask myself, therefore, whether the agreement for lease in this case
                        relevantly relates to the carriage of goods by the defendant ship or to its
                        use or hire. I apply the test as <em>to whether there is a
                            strong argument for the existence of a reasonably direct connection
                            between either of these agreements and those activities</em>. I am
                        satisfied that there is not. So far as connection with the carriage of goods
                        by the defendant ship, it is not unreasonable to bear in mind that the
                        decision in Gatoil rejected the contention that the contract of insurance of
                        goods so carried was sufficiently connected. In the present case, so far as
                        the lease is concerned, its purpose and effect, as previously indicated, was
                        to provide a conveniently close area for the receipt of cargo from the ship
                        and the assembly of cargo to be taken on board the ship. It might
                        conceivably be said that these procedures had a connection with the
                        operations of loading and unloading cargo to and from the ship. I express no
                        concluded view as to that. However, I am satisfied that there is no
                        reasonably direct connection between them and the actual carriage of goods
                        by the ship. There is even less connection, in my view, between those
                        activities and the use or hire of the ship. <em>The licence
                            agreement, the main feature of which was to provide priority berthing
                            for the ship at the nominated berth has, in my opinion, no reasonably
                            direct connection with the carriage of goods by the ship</em>.
                        Although the licence agreement has the effect of providing a regular berth
                        for the ship, the effect of this is to provide a facility, at best, for use
                        by the ship. It does not have any significant connection with the use of the
                        ship itself. Finally, I can see no significant connection between the
                        licence agreement and the hire of the ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The claims were held to be outside the
                    provision because the lease agreement had little to do with the carriage of
                    goods by the defendant’s ship or its use and hire. In the present case,
                    the guarantee provided by HIT was strictly not for or related to the use or hire
                    of the <em>Mahakam</em>. It seems to me that if a claim is
                    brought under an agreement which is collateral or ancillary to the contract of
                    carriage, that collateral or ancillary agreement must also be intrinsically
                    related to the use or hire of a vessel. If the collateral agreement is not
                    intrinsically an agreement relating to the use or hire of a vessel such as a
                    contract of insurance, container leasing agreement, an arbitration agreement in
                    the charterparty or the guarantee in the present case, it would fall outside the
                    purview of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In determining whether a claim can be
                    considered to fall under s 3(1)(<em>h</em>), it would
                    be useful to pose the question, “How did the claim arise?” The
                    answer in this case would be “under the guarantee”. The next
                    relevant question would be, “Did the guarantee relate to the use or hire
                    of the <em>Mahakam</em>?” The answer to that would
                    be in the negative. This approach was adopted by Sheen J in <em>The Stella Nova</em> [1981] Com L R 200, which I found
                    it to be a useful <em>indicium</em> for the direct
                    connection test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the course of the hearing, I also invited
                    the parties to address me on the UK decision of <em>The
                        Zeus</em> [1888] 13 PD 188. In that case, the charterparty
                    provided that the vessel was to proceed to a port to load a full and complete
                    cargo of coal from a colliery against a guarantee from the colliery to pay
                    demurrage to the ship owner if the loading was not completed within 48 hours
                    upon arrival. The court held that although the term demurrage was used in the
                    colliery guarantee, the claim was not based on an agreement relating to the use
                    or hire of the vessel. Significantly, the court held (at 190) that
                    “unless it can be established that the agreement is one in relation to
                    the use or hire of a ship the fact that the word “demurrage” is
                    used is immaterial.” Counsel for the plaintiff sought to distinguish
                        <em>The Zeus</em> on the basis that unlike the present
                    case, the provision of the guarantee was not a condition precedent to the
                    charterparty. Although it may not have been expressed as a condition precedent,
                    it was nonetheless specifically provided in the charterparty itself that the
                    loading of the vessel was on condition of the colliery guarantee annexed to the
                    charterparty. The decisive reason why the colliery guarantee in <em>The Zeus</em> was held not to be an agreement relating to the
                    use or hire of a ship was not because of the manner in which the condition was
                    expressed, but rather because the guarantee in itself did not relate to the use
                    or hire of a ship. Interestingly, <em>The Zeus</em> was
                    decided almost a century before the “direct connection” test was
                    expounded in <em>The Sandrina</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Finally, I will deal with the
                    plaintiff’s remaining submission that in cases where the agreements were
                    held to be outside s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA,
                    typically the vessels were not referred to in the agreements unlike the present
                    case where the Bareboat C/P of the <em>Mahakam</em> was
                    expressly referred to in the recital of the guarantee. From my analysis of the
                    relevant authorities, I do not regard this distinction to be material, much less
                    critical. In <em>The Eschersheim</em>, and <em>The Queen of the South</em>, the vessels were both not
                    specifically mentioned in the agreements and yet they were held to be within the
                    UK equivalent of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>). However, in
                        <em>The Zeus</em>, <em>The
                        Aifanourios</em> and <em>The Bumbesti</em>, by
                    way of illustrations, the vessels were referred to in the agreements but they
                    were still held to be outside the ambit of the provision. The express reference
                    of the vessels in the agreements is therefore clearly not decisive. In <em>The Eschersheim</em> and <em>The Queen of the
                        South</em>, the agreements in themselves related to the use or hire of
                    the vessels even though the vessels were not named in the agreements. On the
                    other hand, in <em>The Zeus</em>, <em>The
                        Aifanourios</em> and <em>The Bumbesti</em>,
                    despite the express reference of the vessels in the agreements, they were held
                    to be outside the provision simply because those agreements were one step
                    removed from the agreements which related to the use or hire of the vessel and
                    hence lacked the requisite “direct connection”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second issue – whether HIT was in possession or control of the
                    <em>Mahakam</em> at the time when the cause of action under
                the guarantee arose</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This issue arises for determination under
                        s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA. At the time when
                    the cause of action accrued against HIT under the guarantee, it is not essential
                    that HIT must be the owner of the <em>Mahakam</em>. This
                    requirement is equally satisfied so long as HIT was either the charterer or in
                    possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em> at the
                    time when the cause of action arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is therefore apposite to embark on the
                    analysis by first determining when the cause of action against HIT
                    accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The principal claim by the plaintiff against
                    Heritage under the Bareboat C/P was for outstanding arrears of charterhire due
                    and owing since 16 April 2009. The Bareboat C/P was eventually terminated
                    on 22 June 2009 due to non-payment of the charterhire and for other
                    breaches of the Bareboat C/P. As the guarantee issued by HIT was to secure the
                    performance and payment of Heritage’s obligations under the Bareboat C/P,
                    it is safe to conclude that the cause of action accrued no earlier than
                    16 April 2009. This was not disputed by the plaintiff. Therefore, the
                    inquiry as to whether HIT was in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em> should be directed during this time
                    frame.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">To lift or not to lift the corporate veil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff relies on the following
                    materials to show that HIT was in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em> at the time when the cause of action
                    arose:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Heritage is a shell corporation
                        through which HIT conducts its business and it has no separate independent
                        identity from HIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     HIT uses Heritage as their “paying/receiving agent” in
                        order to insulate itself from creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Heritage is essentially the “chartering
                        arm” of HIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     HIT makes, receives, approves and/or directs payments on behalf of
                        its wholly owned subsidiaries including Heritage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     HIT and Heritage share common
                        ownership, operations and/or premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     Heritage is the wholly owned subsidiary of HST which is
                        in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of HIT</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_g"></a>(g)     Both HIT and Heritage have at least one common
                        director and authorised signatory in Bobby Andika.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_h"></a>(h)     Agus Darjanto as a common director to
                        both HIT and Heritage signed the guarantee and the Bareboat C/P on behalf of
                        both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_i"></a>(i)     HIT took over possession and control of the <em>Mahakam</em> in or about June 2009 when they provided their crew
                        to take over the <em>Mahakam</em> at Belawan, Indonesia
                        from the crew supplied by the previous managers of
                Heritage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On the basis of the above matters, counsel for
                    the plaintiff submitted that “Heritage and PT Humpus should properly be
                    considered as a single economic unit with no corporate distinction between them,
                    thus rendering each liable for the debts of the other.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It seems to me that the plaintiff was
                    effectively inviting the court to lift the corporate veil in order to show that
                    HIT was in reality the charterers of the <em>Mahakam</em>
                    under the Bareboat C/P. These same matters were also referred to in the
                    affidavit filed by Fredrik Platou in support of the warrant of arrest. In the
                    same affidavit, the plaintiff alleged that HIT is the alter ego of Heritage. In
                    the light of these assertions, it would appear that the plaintiff was seeking to
                    lift the corporate veil in order to show that HIT was in truth the charterers of
                    the <em>Mahakam</em>. On this basis, HIT prepared
                    substantial submissions to respond to the plaintiff’s perceived attempt to
                    lift the corporate veil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     However, on a plain reading of the indorsement
                    in the writ of summons, it was clear that the plaintiff’s claim against
                    HIT was solely based on the guarantee. There is no separate or alternative claim
                    against HIT under the Bareboat C/P. Accordingly, at the commencement of the
                    hearing, I sought clarification from the plaintiff’s counsel whether she
                    was seeking to lift the corporate veil. She confirmed that the claim as indorsed
                    in the writ of summons is based solely on the guarantee and that she was not
                    attempting to lift the corporate veil in spite of the assertions in the
                    affidavit in support of the warrant of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Implicit in the plaintiff’s confirmation
                    is their acknowledgment that the materials which they were relying on do not
                    justify the lifting of the corporate veil. It is plainly inconsistent and
                    incongruous for the plaintiff to rely on the same materials to show that HIT was
                    in possession or in control of the <em>Mahakam</em> having
                    accepted that Heritage was the bareboat charterers of the <em>Mahakam</em> at all material times. As earlier observed, the
                    plaintiff has commenced London arbitration proceedings against Heritage for the
                    outstanding charterhire under the Bareboat C/P.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The establishment of one-ship companies within
                    a group of companies is a well-known and legitimate practice in the shipping
                    industry: see <em>The Evpo Agnic</em> [1988] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 411 at 415 (“<em>The Evpo
                        Agnic”</em>). There have been numerous unsuccessful attempts to
                    lift the corporate veil in the context of one-ship companies with common
                    shareholdings and/or directors: see <em>The Evpo
                    Agnic</em>, <em>The Maritime Trader</em>, <em>The Neptune</em> [1986] HKLR 345, <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>, <em>The
                        Interippu</em> [1990] SGHC 131 (“<em>The
                        Interippu</em>”) and <em>The Skaw
                        Prince</em> [1994] 3 SLR 379. The court may be minded to
                    lift the corporate veil if there are exceptional circumstances which indicate
                    the presence of a façade or sham set up to deceive or to perpetrate a fraud: see
                        <em>The Aventicum</em>, <em>The Saudi
                        Prince</em> [1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 255 and <em>Win Line (UK) Ltd v Masterpart (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR 98 at 116-117.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     None of the exceptional circumstances exist in
                    the present case to warrant the piercing of the corporate veil. No allegation of
                    fraud was raised by the plaintiff. That explains why the plaintiff did not
                    attempt to lift the corporate veil. After all, the plaintiff chose and agreed to
                    enter into the Bareboat C/P with Heritage with full knowledge that Heritage is
                    related to HIT. In fact, the plaintiff accepted the guarantee from HIT on that
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Person “in possession or in control” of the
                vessel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Section 4(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the HCAJA refers to 3 different entities:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">owner;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">charterer; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">person in possession or in control</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     These different entities concern parties with
                    substantive as opposed to nominal or formal interest in relation to the ship:
                    see <em>The Ohm Mariana</em> [1993] 2 SLR 698 at
                    710 (“<em>The Ohm
                Mariana</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Under Singapore law, an owner refers to the
                    beneficial owner who is vested with the right of sale: see <em>The Ohm Mariana</em>. It is not restricted only to the registered
                    owners as was found to be the case in <em>The Evpo
                        Agnic</em>. Charterer would include voyage, time, demise or even slot
                    charterers. Each of these charterers would have legally enforceable rights in
                    relation to the employment of the ship. By the same token, a named charterer
                    under a sham charterparty is not a charterer within the meaning of
                        s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA as the sham
                    charterparty does not give rise to any legally enforceable rights <em>qua</em> charterer: see <em>The Inai
                        Selasih</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Similarly as rightly observed by Chao JC
                    (as he then was) in <em>The Interippu</em>, the term
                    “in possession or in control” must mean possession or control
                    “as an independent legal right”. Chao JC stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am afraid there is hardly any evidence to show that Corporate Shipping
                        were in possession or control of “Engineer 103”. The fact that
                        H H Wong was managing “Engineer 103” does not necessarily mean
                        that Corporate Shipping were therefore in control or possession of
                        “Engineer 103”. After all, H H Wong was at the relevant time a
                        director of both companies, one being the holding company and the other a
                        subsidiary company. Something more than just a common shareholding or
                        manager/director is required to sustain a claim of “possession or
                        control”, otherwise, it would sweep aside the entire concept of
                        corporate structures and entities. I am inclined to accept the submission of
                        the Defendants that the term “in possession or in control” in
                        section 4(4) must mean possession or control as an independent legal right;
                        or at least the possession or control must be pursuant to a specific
                        arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It does not refer to physical possession or
                    control <em>per se</em>. Such a person would include a
                    demise charterer (see <em>The Span Terza</em> [1982]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 225 at 227), a salvor in possession (see
                        <em>The Evpo Agnic</em> at 414), a purchaser under a
                    conditional sale agreement (see <em>The Permina 3001</em>
                    [1977] 1 MLJ 141 at 144), and a person who is in a position of a
                    demise charterer albeit not under a demise charter (see <em>The
                        Evpo Agnic</em> at 414). It would also cover a mortgagee in possession
                    who has taken over the vessel following the default of the mortgagor. The common
                    denominator is that each of them has legally enforceable rights as regards
                    possession or control of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The matters relied on are largely material in
                    relation to an attempt to lift the corporate veil which the plaintiff conceded
                    they were not seeking to do. In any event, none of them either singly or
                    collectively would justify the veil to be pierced. Based on the evidence before
                    me, Heritage has substantial assets in excess of US$30m. It maintains its own
                    bank accounts with Bank Negara Indonesia, CMIB Bank and BNP Paribas. The fact
                    that it does not maintain its own employees is not remarkable in itself. It is
                    not uncommon for wholly owned subsidiaries to share and use office premises and
                    employees with their parents or the ultimate holding company. The plaintiff also
                    referred to various emails to suggest that HIT had paid the ship management fees
                    for the <em>Mahakam</em> and had arranged to pay various
                    expenses on behalf of Heritage. However, the evidence suggest otherwise. While
                    HIT may have been involved in the payment process, the evidence indicate that
                    the payments were made from Heritage’s bank accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Even if HIT has control over Heritage directly
                    or through HST, it is strictly irrelevant for the present purposes since it is a
                    fundamental principle of company law that a shareholder has no property, legal
                    or equitable, in the assets of the company: see <em>The Maritime
                        Trader</em> at 157 and <em>The Interippu</em> at
                    6. Furthermore, having control over Heritage does not translate into
                    “possession or control” over the <em>Mahakam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff also relied on the Ship
                    Management Agreement dated 14 December 2007 under which HIT was appointed
                    by Heritage to manage the <em>Mahakam</em>. In July 2008,
                    Heritage appointed an independent company, Seaquestsandigan Pte Ltd
                    (“Seaquestsandigan”) to take over the management of the vessel
                    from HIT. Accordingly, HIT were not even the ship managers of the vessel in
                    April 2009 when the cause of action accrued. The plaintiff alleged that
                    Seaquestsandigan’s appointment was limited only to the technical and
                    crewing responsibilities and that all other management duties remained with HIT.
                    Even accepting the plaintiff’s submission, the management of the <em>Mahakam</em> pursuant to an appointment by Heritage does not
                    vest any legally enforceable rights on HIT as regards possession or control over
                    the <em>Mahakam</em>. It would be wrong to treat ship
                    managers as being “in possession or in control” of a vessel. Their
                    responsibilities over the vessel arise by reason of their appointment by the
                    principal. If the managers should exercise any rights of control or possession
                    over the vessel, it would be on behalf of their principal and not as an
                    independent legal right. The appointment can be terminated by the principal just
                    as in this case when Heritage appointed Seaquestsandigan to take over from HIT
                    in July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Further, the plaintiff submitted that the
                    supply of crew by HIT for the <em>Mahakam</em> at Belawan,
                    Indonesia in June 2009 amounted to taking possession or control over the vessel.
                    According to the affidavit of Capt Thanabalasingam s/o Balakrishnan, the crew
                    was supplied by HIT following his request on behalf of Heritage after
                    Seaquestsandigan removed their crew from the <em>Mahakam</em> upon the termination of their ship management agreement.
                    The supply of crew was therefore not to enable HIT to take over physical
                    possession or control of the <em>Mahakam</em> from
                    Seaquestsandigan or even Heritage, but rather to enable the vessel to be manned
                    at the request of Heritage after Seaquestsandigan removed their
                crew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff also relied on the decision of
                    the Federal Court of Australia in <em>Malaysia Shipyard and
                        Engineering Sdn Bhd v Iron Shortland</em> [1995] FCA 1565
                        (“<em>Iron Shortland</em>”). In that case
                    the claimant sought and succeeded in lifting the corporate veil to show that the
                    parent company, Capeco Maritime NV (“Capeco Maritime”) was the
                    beneficial owner of the two vessels, <em>Iron
                        Shortland</em> and <em>Newcastle Pride</em> even
                    though they were registered in the names of their wholly owned subsidiaries. The
                    finding was based on the evidence presented by the claimant. Having found that
                    Capeco Maritime was the beneficial owner of the vessel, the court observed that
                    the “evidence at least establishes that Capeco Maritime was in possession
                    or control of the <em>Newcastle Pride</em>”. The
                    facts are therefore entirely different from the present case. First, the
                    plaintiff concedes that they are not seeking to lift the corporate veil. In any
                    event, the lifting of the corporate veil in the <em>Iron
                        Shortland</em> was based on the specific evidence presented in that
                    case. Secondly, as Capeco Maritime was found to be the beneficial owner of the
                    vessel, <em>a fortiori</em> they would be in possession or
                    in control of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Finally, the plaintiff also relied on
                        <em>The Fua Kavenga</em>. Any inquiry as to whether a
                    person was “in possession or in control” of a vessel is primarily
                    a question of fact taking into account the applicable legal principles. As such,
                    the mere fact that a person who had provided a guarantee was found to be
                    “in possession or in control” of a vessel in one case does not
                    mean that all guarantors would likewise be treated in the same way. Each case
                    must necessarily be decided on its own facts. <em>The Fua
                        Kavenga</em> does not provide any useful guidance on this issue. In
                    fact, counsel for the plaintiff accepted that this issue was not properly
                    considered. The court appeared to have accepted that the guarantor in <em>The Fua Kavenga</em> was “in possession or in
                    control” of the vessel because the chartererers were “in a variety
                    of ways the agent or alter ego of the (guarantor)”: at 567. Furthermore,
                    Smellie J also referred to the submission by counsel on the lifting of the
                    corporate veil without any indication whether the veil would be lifted on the
                    evidence before him. Given that there was no analysis as to why the guarantor
                    was determined to be a person “in possession or in control” of the
                    vessel and since there is no issue for the lifting of the corporate veil in the
                    instant case unlike <em>The Fua Kavenga</em>, with respect,
                    I do not find the decision to be instructive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I therefore hold that the plaintiff has failed
                    to satisfy me on the two jurisdictional issues raised by HIT. Failure to satisfy
                    either would be fatal. In the result, the admiralty jurisdiction of the High
                    Court was improperly invoked against HIT’s vessel, <em>Catur Samudra</em>. Accordingly, it is axiomatic that the writ of
                    summons and the warrant of arrest must be set aside which I so ordered on
                    21 December 2009. HIT is awarded costs of the action as well as the
                    application to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     HIT has a remaining prayer for damages for
                    wrongful arrest. When I delivered my oral judgment, I provisionally indicated
                    subject to full arguments from both parties that this was perhaps not an
                    appropriate case for damages to be awarded. I, however, adjourned the prayer
                    with liberty to HIT to restore it for hearing before me within 14 days from the
                    date of the oral decision. 14 days have since elapsed and HIT has elected not to
                    proceed with the claim for wrongful arrest.</p>
