<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Manuchar Steel Hong
                    Kong Limited (“Manuchar”) seeking pre-action discovery from Star
                    Pacific Line Pte Ltd (“Star Pacific”) of all documents relating to
                    the hire, use or operation of a vessel, Fusion 1, by Star Pacific or its
                    servants or agents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Manuchar wanted the documents to determine if
                    Star Pacific was part of a single economic entity which another company known as
                    SPL Shipping Limited (“SPL Shipping”) was also a part of. Manuchar
                    had hoped to use the information in the documents to commence proceedings
                    against Star Pacific to enforce two arbitral awards which it had obtained
                    against SPL Shipping (“the Awards”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I dismissed the application for two
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Manuchar could not persuade me
                        that the documents that it sought were <em>necessary</em> for the purpose of determining if it had
                        sufficient facts to allege that SPL Shipping and Star Pacific were a single
                        economic entity to the extent that the Awards could be enforced against Star
                        Pacific.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        in any event, Manuchar could not persuade me that its intended cause of
                        action against Star Pacific was recognised at law under either the
                        International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”)
                        or general company law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Manuchar applied for leave to appeal my decision
                    which I granted. As far as I am aware, no Notice of Appeal has been
                    filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Manuchar is a global logistics services provider
                    based in Hong Kong. Star Pacific is a Singapore-incorporated company. SPL
                    Shipping is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
                    (“BVI”) as a company limited by shares. SPL Shipping’s
                    incorporation was procured by its registered agent, Nerine Trust Company (BVI)
                    Limited (“Nerine Trust”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Manuchar chartered the vessel, Fusion 1, from
                    SPL Shipping under a charterparty dated 9 July 2008 brokered by agents. Manuchar
                    candidly acknowledged that it was not aware, at the time it entered into the
                    charterparty, that SPL Shipping was a BVI company. The charterparty provided for
                    arbitration in London in the event of disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dispute, Arbitration and the Awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Manuchar claimed monies against SPL Shipping
                    arising from disputes under the charterparty in 2008. In pursuit of its claim,
                    Manuchar commenced arbitration proceedings in London but SPL Shipping did not
                    participate at all in the arbitration. Under the Awards made in the arbitration,
                    SPL Shipping was to pay Manuchar its principal claim in the amount of
                    US$427,326.73, interest, and costs of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The substantive orders were made in October
                    2009, in the Final Award. The second award, a supplementary award, was issued
                    months later in January 2011. It was issued to correct a heading in the Final
                    Award which had misdescribed SPL Shipping as “SPL Shipping Limited of
                    Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Enforcement of Awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Awards were nothing more than paper
                    judgments as far as Manuchar was concerned. It had taken various steps to
                    enforce the Awards in three different jurisdictions but those efforts were in
                    vain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As early as 28 October 2009, Manuchar made a
                    demand against SPL Shipping by fax for the sums under the Awards. It gave SPL
                    Shipping until 6 November 2009 to comply. There was no response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Manuchar then contacted SPL Shipping on three
                    separate occasions, during the period between September 2010 and January 2011,
                    essentially notifying SPL Shipping that the arbitrator would correct the heading
                    of the Final Award which, as mentioned above, resulted in the supplementary
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     These notices were served on SPL Shipping at 5
                    Shenton Way, #27-08, an office building in Singapore. Interestingly, the person
                    who received these notices stamped the acknowledgment copies with SPL
                    Shipping’s corporate stamp.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Manuchar then sought registration of the
                    Awards in Singapore, England and the BVI under the enforcement regimes of each
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Manuchar obtained an order from the Singapore
                    High Court in early January 2012 granting it liberty to enforce the Awards
                    against SPL Shipping. This was then served on SPL Shipping at its registered
                    address in the BVI, although it was addressed to Nerine Trust. A manager from
                    Nerine Trust acknowledged receipt of service on SPL Shipping’s behalf. It
                    was not entirely clear what role Nerine Trust played but it appears that they
                    provided corporate secretarial services to SPL Shipping.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     A similar enforcement order was obtained from
                    the English High Court in early 2012. There was no evidence, however, of service
                    of this order on SPL Shipping either in the BVI or in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Finally, a similar enforcement order was
                    obtained from the High Court of Justice in the BVI in July 2012. Manuchar, as
                    creditor, then served a statutory demand on SPL Shipping at its registered
                    address in the BVI in September 2012. Again, service was acknowledged by a
                    manager from Nerine Trust. This statutory demand was issued pursuant to the
                    Insolvency Act, 2003 (No 5 of 2003) which governed the law and procedure
                    relating to insolvency in the BVI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to Manuchar, SPL Shipping completely
                    ignored the relevant court processes and orders despite receiving service and
                    notice of the various enforcement processes. No payment was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Manuchar’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Consequently, Manuchar sought enforcement of
                    the Awards against Star Pacific on the premise that SPL Shipping and Star
                    Pacific are (or were) a single economic entity. Ms Leong Lu Yuan, counsel for
                    Manuchar, explained that the concept of a single economic entity provided that
                    two or more distinct and separate companies can be regarded at law as having the
                    same corporate personality on the ground that they were part of a single
                    economic entity. Ms Leong submitted that this concept has been recognised by the
                    Singapore courts in appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Ms Leong provided five facts in support of the
                    single economic entity argument:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     SPL Shipping and Star Pacific shared
                        the same Singapore office, apparently being 80 Robinson Road, #09-02
                        (“the Robinson Road office”). I would just observe here that
                        this was not the address which Manuchar sent the notices informing SPL
                        Shipping of the misdescription in the Final Award (see [12]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Other
                        parties in the chain of charterparties concerning Fusion 1 appeared to have
                        addressed their correspondence to Star Pacific.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Instructions and correspondence concerning
                        Fusion 1 appeared to have come from Star Pacific’s employees and/or
                        SPL Shipping’s personnel signing off in the name of Star
                        Pacific.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     Documents sent to, or served on, SPL Shipping in Singapore at the Robinson
                        Road office, were accepted and acknowledged as having been received by SPL
                        Shipping. SPL Shipping and Star Pacific also shared the same fax
                        number.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        plaintiffs in two separate civil suits in the US had similarly alleged that
                        SPL Shipping and Star Pacific were one economic entity or in any case had no
                        separate corporate identity. These plaintiffs are not connected or
                        associated with Manuchar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In this application, Manuchar provided an
                    extensive set of documents including emails, letters and court documents which
                    supported its factual assertions. However, Manuchar claimed that these documents
                    were insufficient for the purposes of formulating its claim that SPL Shipping
                    and Star Pacific are (or were) part of a single economic entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Manuchar therefore wanted pre-action discovery
                    of “all documents which are or have been in [Star Pacific’s]
                    possession, custody or power, relating to the hire, use and/or operation of the
                    vessel ‘Fusion 1’ by [Star Pacific] and/or their servants or
                    agents”, including but not limited to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     correspondence, notes and memoranda
                        passing between SPL Shipping and Star Pacific in the period of June 2008 to
                        September 2008;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     the charterparty and/or fixture note and/or other similar document between
                        Star Pacific and the owners and/or disponent owners of Fusion 1 for the hire
                        and/or use of the said vessel in the period of June 2008 to September 2008;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     bank
                        statements, cash book entries and ledgers, and other documents relating to
                        all financial transactions involving the hire, use and/or operation of
                        Fusion 1 in the period of June 2008 to September 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Star Pacific’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Star Pacific’s case was put forward by
                    its sole director and sole shareholder, one Mr Ham, who was neither a director
                    nor employee of Star Pacific at the material time of the dispute in 2008. He
                    only assumed directorship and ownership of Star Pacific in July 2010 from the
                    previous South Korean director cum sole shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Ham disputed the allegation that SPL
                    Shipping and Star Pacific are (or were) a single economic entity. He said that
                    at the material time, Star Pacific was only an agent of SPL Shipping, as
                    evidenced by an agency agreement. Although Star Pacific shared the same premises
                    with SPL Shipping, namely, the Robinson Road office, so too did at least three
                    other Korean companies. All of them were however separate entities albeit they
                    did, from time to time, take receipt of mail and other deliveries on behalf of
                    each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For good measure, Mr Ham insisted in his
                    affidavit that he did not have the documents sought by Manuchar (as described at
                    [21] above). Ms Leong, however, argued that Mr Ham’s affirmation on oath
                    was insufficient as he had not made it clear that Star Pacific (as opposed to
                    its sole director) did not have the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What was meant by single economic entity </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I begin by explaining what I understood the
                    single economic entity concept to mean for the purposes of this application. The
                    single economic entity concept means different things in different contexts. It
                    would be dangerous to assume or, worse still, equate the understanding of the
                    single economic entity concept for statutory purposes (such as taxation or
                    competition laws) with the use of the single economic entity concept in the
                    present context, which is simply a dispute between companies over <em>liability under a contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The single economic entity concept that I
                    understood Manchuar to have relied on in this application may be described by
                    the following example. P enters into a contract with D which is related to a
                    third company, TC. The exact relationship between D and TC – whether
                    parent-subsidiary or two subsidiaries owned by the same parent – is
                    unknown but it is accepted that D and TC are part of the same corporate group. D
                    breaches the contract. However, as D is essentially a shell company with no
                    assets, P is considering two options:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     P commences proceedings against TC
                        for D’s breach of contract; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     P commences proceedings against D first, and if P
                        succeeds, P then enforces as against TC the judgment (or arbitral award)
                        which it obtains against D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In both options above, P intends to argue that
                    it has a valid claim against TC because TC and D operate as a single economic
                    entity. The crux of P’s argument that TC is equally liable for D’s
                    breach is because TC and D are part of a single economic entity, D’s
                    liability belongs as much to D as it does to other members of the same economic
                    entity, one of them being TC. In the present application, Manuchar sought to
                    make Star Pacific liable for SPL Shipping’s breach via the second
                    option.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pre-action discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I will now discuss the law relating to
                    pre-action discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Discovery applications may be made before the
                    commencement of an action or proceedings against another party. This is
                    expressly provided in O 24 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev
                    Ed) which has as its source para 12 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court
                    of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”): <em>Ching Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2012] 4 SLR
                    185 (“<em>Ching Mun Fong</em>”) at
                    [16].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Court of Appeal said in <em>Ching Mun Fong</em> at [18] that the plaintiff must satisfy the twin
                    requirements of (a) relevance; and (b) necessity, to succeed in an application
                    for pre-action discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The requirement of relevance is prescribed in
                    O 24 r 6(3)(<em>b</em>) but it is, in any case,
                    self-evident. The documents sought must be relevant to an issue arising or
                    likely to arise out of the potential claim against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the present case, it was difficult to argue
                    that the documents sought were not relevant to the issue of whether SPL Shipping
                    and Star Pacific are (or were) a single economic entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This may be why Mr Jeyabalen, counsel for Star
                    Pacific, trained his attention chiefly on the necessity
                requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Necessity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Unlike the requirement of relevance, necessity
                    is carved out as a standalone requirement under a separate rule, O 24 r 7, which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Discovery to be ordered only
                            if necessary (O. 24, r. 7)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7</b>.    On the hearing of an
                            application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if
                            satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that
                            stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn
                            the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if
                            and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either
                            for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving
                        costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Saying that discovery of a document is a
                    “necessity” or is “necessary” does not mean much.
                    Necessity must be considered in relation to another concept; something is
                    necessary only by reference to an identifiable end. Under O 24 r 7, necessity
                    principally references two discrete considerations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     fair disposal of the cause or
                        matter; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     saving costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     These two considerations apply generally to
                    discovery applications, not just pre-action discovery applications. But
                    pre-action discovery is somewhat unique because it concerns disclosure even
                    before proceedings have begun. In that specific context, the courts, in
                    determining whether the necessity requirement is satisfied, generally ask
                    whether the potential plaintiff has sufficient facts that would enable it to
                    formulate a claim, and therefore be in a position to commence
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     If a potential plaintiff is in possession of
                    sufficient facts to commence proceedings, pre-action discovery is unnecessary
                    and accordingly would not be granted (see <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong</em> at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Therefore, the crux relates to the sufficiency
                    of knowledge that would place the plaintiff in a position to put forward a cause
                    of action. As Prof Jeffrey Pinsler succinctly summarised, “if the
                    claimant has sufficient evidence to mount a claim, he is not entitled
                    to discovery before proceedings in order to complete his ‘entire
                    picture’ of the case”: <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 24/6/2. This comment was cited
                    with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong</em> (at [26]).  </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Court of Appeal in <em>Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 2 SLR
                    208 (“<em>Dorsey James Michael</em>”)
                    recently reaffirmed this. It held (at [48]) that if the plaintiff at the time of
                    the making of the application can immediately commence proceedings against the
                    defendant in relation to the controversy at hand without disclosure, that fact
                    operates as a “significant consideration against the making of [the]
                    order … as pre-action disclosure is then not
                necessary”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fishing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Before I address the facts of this case in
                    relation to the requirement of necessity, I digress briefly to address the
                    notion of “fishing expeditions” which is how discovery
                    applications are frequently characterised. This was argued in the course of the
                    hearings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Fishing expeditions in discovery applications
                    typically do not fare well – pre-action discovery will not be ordered to
                    enable a plaintiff to go on a fishing expedition: <em>Kuah Kok
                        Kim and others v Ernst &amp; Young</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 485
                        (“<em>Kuah Kok Kim</em>”) at
                [31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, whether a party is
                    “fishing” is not strictly speaking a test, and the answer to that
                    question has no consequence when considered in a vacuum. If
                    “fishing” means asking for a generally broad category of
                    documents, every pre-action discovery application will inevitably involve some
                    amount of fishing. It would therefore not assist a defendant to say that the
                    plaintiff is fishing for documents, without saying why the request for those
                    documents should be denied by reference to the twin requirements of relevance
                    and necessity. The court would find greater assistance by submissions that
                    explain whether the twin considerations of relevance and necessity are
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Manuchar relied on the High Court decision in
                        <em>Asta Rickmers Schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Cie KG v
                        Hub Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 283 (“<em>Asta Rickmers</em>”) in which pre-action discovery was
                    granted. Ms Leong submitted that I should follow <em>Asta
                        Rickmers</em> because the fact pattern in that case and the present
                    case were similar and the documents sought were “essentially [of] the
                    same types”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     
          <em>Asta Rickmers</em>
                    does bear some resemblance to the present case. In that case, the operation of a
                    vessel had been chartered by the plaintiff owner to a company known as Hub Lines
                    Pte Ltd. The charterparty was then terminated by Hub Lines, an act which the
                    plaintiff alleged was in breach of the charterparty. The matter proceeded to
                    arbitration in London and it appeared that Hub Lines did not participate in
                    those proceedings. The plaintiff was awarded approximately US$2.3m, interest and
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Shortly before the award was rendered, another
                    creditor of Hub Lines commenced winding-up proceedings against Hub Lines. The
                    plaintiff then sought to make the defendant in <em>Asta
                        Rickmers</em>, Hub Marine, liable for the sum under the award by
                    alleging that Hub Marine was the real charterer of the vessel; that Hub Lines
                    was a front for Hub Marine; and that Hub Marine was a sub-charterer of the
                    vessel under a back-to-back charterparty or similar arrangement with Hub
                    Lines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Tay Yong Kwang J affirmed the Deputy
                    Registrar’s decision to grant pre-action discovery on the basis that the
                    documents would enable the plaintiff to ascertain if Hub Marine was in fact the
                    real charterer of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I chose not to follow the decision in
                        <em>Asta Rickmers</em> for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The first is factual. The plaintiff in
                        <em>Asta Rickmers</em> wanted, through the pre-action
                    discovery application, to ascertain the “true involvement of [Hub Marine]
                    in the charterparty” (<em>Asta Rickmers</em> at
                    [19]). However, all the evidence it had was circumstantial:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     a survey report which named Hub
                        Marine as the charterer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     letters to the master of the vessel, sailing instructions
                        and a circular were all sent on the notepaper of Hub
                    Marine;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     evidence
                        that Hub Marine paid most of the charter hire; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a>(d)     notes to the accounts and report of
                        Hub Lines’ auditors which made no mention of the claim on the
                        charterparty made by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In these circumstances, Tay J felt that it
                    would assist the plaintiff if it had, in addition to the above evidence,
                    documents from Hub Marine in the nature of correspondence, notes and memoranda
                    relating to the hire, use and/or operation of the vessel. These documents would
                    provide <em>direct</em> evidence of Hub Marine’s
                    principal involvement in the charterparty which was the plaintiff’s
                    purported objective in making the pre-action discovery
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I could not say the same for Manuchar. Its
                    intended cause of action was different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Manuchar argued that the Awards could be
                    enforced against Star Pacific on the basis that SPL Shipping and Star Pacific
                    are (or were) a single economic entity. Manuchar was not seeking to ascertain
                    Star Pacific’s involvement in the charterparty as such, but that SPL
                    Shipping and Star Pacific are (or were) operating as a single economic
                    entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Jeyabalen argued, in the main, that
                    Manuchar had more than sufficient evidence in its possession and knowledge to
                    commence and prosecute its claim, hence pre-action discovery was unnecessary. I
                    agreed with this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Manuchar was able to provide five facts to
                    support its allegation of a single economic entity (see [19] above). More
                    impressive, though, was the amount of documentary evidence adduced in the
                    Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit given by one Mr Maas. Mr Maas exhibited
                    in his affidavit 49 items of mostly correspondence, emails, faxes, and letters
                    spread over approximately 150 pages. These exhibits show, to varying extents,
                    the closeness in proximity between SPL Shipping and Star Pacific.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The evidence was so comprehensive that it even
                    showed that personnel who dealt with Manuchar on the Fusion 1 charterparty had
                    signed off on behalf of Star Pacific; and that other parties in the charterparty
                    chain had at times addressed their correspondence to Star Pacific. Manuchar
                    believed (and asserted in this application) that SPL Shipping and Star Pacific
                    were operating as a single economic entity because of these
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Given that such documents were already in the
                    possession and knowledge of Manuchar, I found it difficult to accept Ms
                    Leong’s argument that further documents held by Star Pacific in relation
                    to its involvement with Fusion 1 during the relevant period, if any, were
                        <em>necessary</em> for commencing a claim that SPL
                    Shipping and Star Pacific are (or were) operating as a single economic
                    entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Manuchar appeared to be labouring under the
                    impression that it required <em>evidence</em> to <em>prove</em> its single economic entity theory before it could
                    commence proceedings. In Mr Maas’ affidavit, he affirmed that Manuchar
                    would sue Star Pacific upon “obtaining evidence of their right to do
                    so”. This was erroneous, as only facts, not evidence, need be pleaded
                    (see O 18 r 7 and <em>Ching Mun Fong</em> at
                [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The focus of the law on pre-action discovery
                    is the sufficiency of knowledge and possession of facts to plead and formulate a
                    claim. It was therefore clear to me that Manuchar was adequately informed to
                    formulate a pleading that Star Pacific and SPL Shipping operated as a single
                    economic entity and commence proceedings on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Applying the formulation in <em>Whang Tar Liang v Standard Chartered Bank</em> [2011] SGHC 154
                        (“<em>Whang Tar Liang</em>”) at [10],
                    Manuchar was already in a position to “come to a determination of
                    its cause(s) of action”; indeed, it already <em>knew</em> what its cause of action was and the facts that supported
                    that cause of action. I did not think that the requirement of necessity was
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Before I leave the facts, I am compelled to
                    mention that Ms Leong was unable to provide any meaningful response, when
                    pressed, why discovery after the commencement of proceedings would not suffice.
                    The Court of Appeal in <em>Dorsey James Michael</em> (at
                    [49]) noted, as a relevant consideration, that the plaintiff ought to give
                    reasons why it was neither convenient nor just for the information to be sought
                        <em>after</em> proceedings had been commenced. Against
                    that backdrop, the absence of any explanation by Ms Leong made Manuchar’s
                    application rather weak.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     This leads me to the second reason, a legal
                    one, for not following <em>Asta Rickmers.</em> The law on
                    pre-action discovery has received the benefit of clarification in subsequent
                    cases which may have resulted in a different outcome in <em>Asta
                        Rickmers</em> (had these cases been available when <em>Asta Rickmers</em> was decided).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The leading case when <em>Asta
                        Rickmers</em> was decided was <em>Kuah Kok
                        Kim</em>, which as a Court of Appeal decision, was binding on Tay J
                    and was therefore duly applied (<em>Asta Rickmers</em> at
                    [36]). However, the Court of Appeal clarified one aspect of <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> in its more recent decision in <em>Ching Mun Fong</em> (at [19]–[23] and
                [27]–[28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The clarification related to the citation in
                        <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> (at [38]) of a statement made in
                        <em>Dunning v Board of Governors of the United Liverpool
                        Hospitals</em> [1973] 1 WLR 586 by Lord Denning MR. Lord Denning
                    stated (at 590) that “[o]ne of the objects of [pre-action discovery] is
                    to enable the plaintiff to find out – before he starts proceedings –
                    whether he has a <em>good</em> cause of action or
                    not” [emphasis added]. The court in <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong</em> was concerned that this statement may have created the
                    impression that the purpose of pre-action discovery is to enable the plaintiff
                    to determine whether he had a cause of action which he could make out on the
                    evidence and so, in that sense, is “good”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The court in <em>Ching Mun
                        Fong</em> noted that such an interpretation was incorrect, as
                    pre-action discovery was permitted not to assist a plaintiff in
                    “developing and finessing his causes of action” or in
                    “obtaining evidence to boost [its] case”, but so that the
                    plaintiff may discover a set of facts to fashion a claim against a potential
                    defendant (see <em>Ching Mun Fong</em> at [21] and [28]).
                    In other words, the effect of pre-action discovery on the merits of the
                    plaintiff’s claim was not a relevant consideration (see <em>Whang Tar Liang</em> at [10]). Rather, the focus was, as emphasised
                    in <em>Ching Mun Fong</em> at [28], on the possession of
                    facts sufficient to <em>formulate</em> a claim (see
                    [37]–[39] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Therefore, whilst a court solely applying
                        <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> may have construed the law as
                    allowing a more generous approach towards granting pre-action discovery, that is
                    no longer a tenable approach after <em>Ching Mun
                    Fong</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Without <em>Asta
                        Rickmers</em>, Manuchar had nothing left by way of authority to
                    sustain its application. I would have dismissed it on the sole basis that the
                    necessity requirement was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     However, I would have dismissed the
                    application for another reason – I was of the view that the intended cause
                    of action was not viable at law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Viability of cause of action</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Enforcement of arbitral awards against a non-party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     To recapitulate, Manuchar’s intended
                    cause of action was to enforce the Awards against Star Pacific on the ground
                    that SPL Shipping and Star Pacific operated as a single economic entity. I was
                    skeptical, initially, whether such an action would be considered as disclosing
                    no reasonable cause of action and therefore liable to be struck out under O 18 r
                        19(<em>a</em>) in any event. Order 18 r 19(<em>b</em>) was also another possibility. If that proved to be
                    correct, Manuchar would not have a “good” cause of action, not in
                    the sense that it would be unable to establish its cause of action on the facts,
                    but in the sense that it did not even have a recognisable cause of action on
                    which to proceed. I therefore requested the parties to provide further
                    submissions on the nature of Maunchar’s intended cause of action in
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     My initial skepticism was not unfounded. In
                    particular, I appreciated Ms Leong’s honest acknowledgment in her further
                    submissions that pursuant to s 31(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    IAA, “it [was] not possible to seek enforcement of an arbitration award
                    against a non-party to the arbitration agreement”. She also helpfully
                    provided authority, in the form of Chan Leng Sun, <em>Singapore
                        Law on Arbitral Awards</em> (Academy Publishing, 2001) at paras
                    7.55–7.56. Finally, she was candid enough to acknowledge that she was not
                    aware of any case where an arbitral award had been enforced against a party in
                    Star Pacific’s position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     To that I would add that Star Pacific was not
                    just a stranger to the arbitration agreement in the charterparty. Star Pacific
                    was not even named as a respondent in the arbitration that took place in London;
                    and accordingly it never had an opportunity to decide if it wished to contest
                    the claims made in the arbitration. Last but not least, Star Pacific was not the
                    award debtor under the Awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Enforcing an award against a party in the
                    shoes of Star Pacific in these circumstances would be anathema to the
                    “internal logic of the consensual basis of an agreement to
                    arbitrate”, to borrow the words of the Court of Appeal in <em>PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK)
                        v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</em>
                    [2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<em>Astro</em>”) at
                    [198].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     A decision of the English High Court supports
                    my view that Manuchar did not have a cause of action recognised at law. In
                        <em>Peterson Farms Inc v C&amp;M Farming Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 603 (“<em>Peterson
                        Farms</em>”), the respondent in an arbitration sought a
                    declaration from the court that certain findings in an award were made without
                    jurisdiction because those findings related to members of the claimant group
                    that did not enter into a binding arbitration agreement with the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The respondent’s argument had been
                    rejected by the arbitral tribunal because the tribunal accepted the
                    “group of companies” doctrine. The arbitral tribunal’s
                    reasoning explains what it understood this doctrine to mean, and it is helpful
                    to set out the relevant portion (<em>Peterson Farms</em> at
                    [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The Tribunal does not consider that it is legally precluded from
                        considering C&amp;M's damages claims to cover and embrace the damages of all
                        C&amp;M Group companies. <em>The group of companies doctrine
                            provides that an arbitration agreement signed by one company in a group
                            of companies entitles (or obligates) affiliate non-signatory companies,
                            if the circumstances surrounding negotiation, execution, and termination
                            of the agreement show that the mutual intention of all the parties was
                            to bind the non-signatories.</em> Following the Dow Chemical
                        decision and ICC case numbers 2375 and 5103, <em>the Tribunal
                            recognised that </em><b><em>because a group of
                            companies constitute the same “economic reality” one
                            company in the group can bind the other members </em></b><em>to an agreement if such a result conforms to the mutual
                            intentions of all the parties and reflects the good usage of
                            international commerce.</em> This Tribunal considers that such
                        circumstances are present in this case. … [emphasis added in italics
                        and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Ostensibly, there is a striking similarity
                    between the “group of companies” doctrine described above and the
                    single economic entity concept that Manuchar was relying on (see [26]–[27]
                    above). For present purposes, it is not necessary to comment on the Dow Chemical
                    case, a decision of an ICC arbitral tribunal in 1982, which remains highly
                    controversial in many jurisdictions (see Gary Born, <em>International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014)
                        (“<em>Born</em>”) at pp 1450–1454).
                    More germane to this present case was Langley J’s decision in <em>Peterson Farms</em> on whether the arbitral tribunal had, by
                    relying on the group of companies doctrine, wrongly assumed
                jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In his judgment (at [42]), Langley J
                    considered the arbitral tribunal’s decision “open to a number of
                    substantial criticisms” and “seriously flawed in law”. He
                    held that the issue of whether the respondent had contracted with the other
                    members of the claimant group was governed by the proper law of the contract
                    which was Arkansas law and which the parties had agreed was the same as English
                    law. On that basis, the arbitral tribunal should not have applied the
                    “group of companies” doctrine as that doctrine “forms no
                    part of English law” (at [59]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I will discuss later (see [88]–[136]
                    below) the broader issue of whether the single economic entity concept –
                    which was argued to be a principle of general company law and not just
                    arbitration law – has any standing in Singapore company law. For now, the
                    import of <em>Peterson Farms</em> was that as a matter of
                    arbitration principle, a tribunal has no jurisdiction to bind strangers to the
                    arbitration agreement on the basis that these strangers are part of a larger
                    group under the “group of companies” doctrine. This was yet
                    another example of how stringently the courts regard consent to
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In my view, the decisions in <em>Peterson Farms</em> and <em>Astro</em>
                    clarified beyond doubt that an arbitral award cannot impose enforceable
                    obligations on strangers to an arbitration agreement. Star Pacific, being a
                    stranger to the charterparty and by extension the arbitration agreement –
                    and this was undisputed – could not be made liable for SPL
                    Shipping’s obligations under the Awards. Hence, Manuchar’s attempt
                    to enforce the Awards against Star Pacific was not viable at law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Mr Jeyabalen characterised Manuchar’s
                    conduct in going after Star Pacific as a “witch hunt”, which
                    conduct was caused by Manuchar’s own lack of due diligence in entering
                    into a charterparty with a BVI entity. I did not think that the characterisation
                    was fair or necessary or that he needed to go that far. Instead, I considered it
                    material that Manuchar had commenced arbitration against SPL Shipping only and
                    not Star Pacific as well. Perhaps Maunchar did not have sufficient confidence,
                    at the time of commencement of the arbitration, that it would succeed before the
                    tribunal in joining Star Pacific to the arbitration using the single economic
                    entity (or any related) argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Manuchar’s decision to prosecute the
                    arbitration against SPL Shipping alone, in light of Ms Leong’s concession,
                    meant that I could not envisage how the court could justify ordering pre-action
                    discovery in support of a cause of action which was unsustainable at law. Doing
                    so would have achieved the exact opposite outcome from the objective of
                    pre-action discovery, that is, to minimise the unnecessary escalation of
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In these circumstances, I could see no
                    principle or policy reason in favour of granting Manuchar’s application.
                    The high threshold required for the granting of pre-action discovery reflects
                    the policy in the law that pre-action discovery “while not exceptional,
                    is not usual” (<em>Dorsey James Michael</em> at
                    [49]). I did not think that the law should encourage parties who acknowledge
                    that their intended cause of action against the defendant was not recognised at
                    law to nevertheless commence pre-action discovery to obtain documents to support
                    that cause of action.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Ms Leong then shifted the goalposts of
                    Manuchar’s case, in her further submissions, by arguing that even if
                    Manuchar could not directly enforce the Awards against Star Pacific, it could
                    obtain the sums payable under the Awards through other means such as commencing
                    execution proceedings to obtain a garnishee order against Star Pacific. Ms Leong
                    referred to the High Court case of <em>Leads Engineering (S) Pte
                        Ltd v Chin Choon Co (Pte) Ltd (personal representatives of the estate of
                        Choo Kok Hoe, deceased, garnishee)</em> [2009] SGHC 53
                        (“<em>Leads Engineering</em>”) in support
                    of her new submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I did not find <em>Leads
                        Engineering</em> helpful to Manuchar’s case as the facts and
                    issue in that case were not directly on point. The plaintiff there was the award
                    creditor. It had been engaged by the defendant, the award debtor, to construct
                    dwelling houses. The defendant was the main contractor for the project. There
                    was a dispute that was referred to arbitration which resulted in an award in the
                    plaintiff’s favour. The plaintiff then applied to enforce the award and
                    was given judgment against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     This was followed by execution proceedings in
                    which the plaintiff obtained, <em>ex parte</em>, a
                    garnishee order against one Mr Choo who had engaged the defendant as the main
                    contractor. Mr Choo was, at that time, a director and shareholder of the
                    defendant together with his sons. However, Mr Choo refused to attend the
                    garnishee proceedings and passed away shortly thereafter. The plaintiff then
                    took out an application for examination of judgment debtor against the late Mr
                    Choo’s son (who was the managing director of the defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The only issue before Lai Siu Chiu J who heard
                    the matter was whether the late Mr Choo’s estate was indebted to the
                    defendant for the purposes of deciding whether the garnishee order should be
                    made absolute. She disbelieved the evidence from the late Mr Choo’s son
                    and found against the estate. The initial garnishee order was made absolute
                    because the burden fell on the estate (as the garnishee) to prove that the late
                    Mr Choo did not owe any monies to the defendant when the <em>ex
                        parte</em> garnishee order was obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I was not quite sure how <em>Leads Engineering</em> advanced Manuchar’s case. The facts of
                        <em>Leads Engineering</em> actually go against
                    Manuchar’s new intended cause of action. The late Mr Choo and his son were
                    sought to be examined in their capacity as officers of the judgment debtor, the
                    defendant, to determine if the defendant was owed monies by the late Mr Choo
                    which could then be garnished from his estate. The analogous situation in the
                    present case would be examination of the corporate officers of SPL Shipping (and
                    not Star Pacific) to determine if SPL Shipping was owed monies by Star Pacific
                    which Manuchar could then garnish. As far as I am aware, there was nothing
                    stopping Manuchar from taking out examination of judgment debtor proceedings
                    against SPL Shipping for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     There was a final point that I should address.
                    Ms Leong submitted that the court in <em>Leads
                        Engineering</em> had enforced the award “so to speak” by
                    taking out garnishee proceedings against the late Mr Choo who was the
                    defendant’s alter ego. That submission is correct only to the extent that
                    Ms Leong said that it was <em>not</em> enforcement of the
                    award <em>against</em> the late Mr Choo (or his estate) as
                    a third party in the same way that Star Pacific was a third party to the
                    arbitration (and to the Awards obtained by Manuchar against SPL Shipping). The
                    discussion of alter ego went only to the question of whether the late Mr Choo
                    did owe the defendant monies which could be the subject of a garnishee
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Simply put, there was no decision that the
                    award obtained against the defendant was enforceable <em>against</em> the late Mr Choo’s estate on the basis that the
                    estate was the alter ego of the defendant, in that the estate was in law the
                    award debtor – just as how Star Pacific was sought to be made the award
                    debtor for the Awards. Thus, it would be more accurate to understand the
                    examination process as part of an execution process following a court judgment
                    already obtained against the <em>defendant</em> (as opposed
                    to the late Mr Choo or his estate) instead of framing the examination of
                    judgment debtor proceedings as an enforcement of the award against a third party
                    “so to speak”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A broader consideration of the single economic entity
                concept</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Thus far, I have only considered the single
                    economic entity concept in the context of the narrow question of whether the
                    Awards can be enforced against Star Pacific under the IAA. This is a question of
                    arbitration law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     However, there is a broader question, which is
                    whether the concept of a single economic entity has wider acceptance under
                    Singapore law as was submitted by Ms Leong (see [18] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I begin with the obvious premise that
                    businesses may be structured to take advantage of any benefit or advantage
                    conferred by law. A basic tenet of company law in Singapore since <em>Aron Salomon (Pauper) v A Salomon and Company, Limited</em>
                    [1897] 1 AC 22 (“<em>Salomon</em>”) is that a
                    company and its shareholders are separate legal persons. Save for very limited
                    exceptions, most of which are statutory, the company has rights and liabilities
                    of its own which are distinct from those of its shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     This basic tenet is the cornerstone of
                    commercial and corporate transactions, so much so that it has even been said
                    that it cannot be disregarded on the mere justification that “justice so
                    requires” (see <em>Adams and others v Cape Industries plc
                        and another</em> [1990] 1 Ch 433 (“<em>Adams</em>”) at 536).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The law recognises that a company has a
                        <em>corporate</em> legal personality independent and
                    indeed separate from the legal personalities of its shareholders. It is not just
                    Singapore law or even the wider common law that recognises the existence of this
                    distinct corporate legal personality; this is the position in most advanced
                    legal systems, as observed by Lord Sumption in <em>Prest v
                        Petrodel Resources Ltd and others</em> [2013] 2 AC 415
                        (“<em>Prest</em>”) at [17].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Because the law allows and treats a company as
                    a separate entity from its shareholders in the ordinary circumstance, it is
                    perfectly acceptable in many jurisdictions, including Singapore, for an
                    enterprise to be established (and carry on business) as a BVI company, with the
                    attendant advantages of non-transparency of ownership, management and financial
                    position – generally, a BVI company need not make public details of its
                    shareholders, directors or financial statements. That the shareholders of a BVI
                    company are unknown or may not be identified through public means is not
                    relevant to whether a BVI company has capacity to enter into legal relations;
                    its capacity is derived not from its shareholders’ legal personalities but
                    from its separate and distinct corporate legal personality. Why any business
                    person would choose to contract with, or accept the credit risk of, a BVI
                    company (without extracting a personal guarantee or other security) is, of
                    course, a separate matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     That said, most legal systems, including
                    Singapore, recognise that there are limits to the implications of a separate
                    corporate legal personality. There are, thus, exceptional situations in which
                    the law, by piercing through the corporate veil that separates the company from
                    its shareholders, <em>ignores</em> the separate legal
                    personalities of the company and its shareholders (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Lew Syn Pau and another</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 210
                        (“<em>Lew Syn Pau</em>”) at
                    [193]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     However, leaving aside statutory imperatives,
                    most of which have to do with tax and competition law purposes, the precise
                    circumstances in which the courts will pierce the corporate veil under common
                    law are not exactly uniform or settled in many common law jurisdictions –
                    there is “no common, unifying principle” as such: see <em>Briggs v James Hardie &amp; Co Pty Ltd</em> (1989) 16 NSWLR
                    549 at 567; <em>Prest</em> at [75]; <em>Kosmopoulos v Constitution Insurance Co of Canada </em> [1987] 1 SCR
                    2 at [12]; <em>Attorney-General v Equiticorp Industries Group Ltd
                        (In Statutory Management)</em> [1996] 1 NZLR 528 at 541; <em>Cape Pacific Ltd v Lubner Controlling Investments (Pty)
                        Ltd</em> (1995) 4 SA 790 (A) at 802–803.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     There is, nevertheless, a general thread that
                    runs through all the authorities in support of the piercing of the corporate
                    veil: the presence of abuse. Again, I can do no better than to repeat Lord
                    Sumption’s opinion in his judgment in <em>Prest</em>
                    (at [27]) that “the recognition of a limited power to pierce the
                    corporate veil in carefully defined circumstances is necessary if the law is not
                    to be disarmed in the face of abuse”. As for what amounts to abuse, Lord
                    Sumption helpfully summarised it as follows (at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company
                        to use it to evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an
                        abuse to cause a legal liability to be incurred by the company in the first
                        place. It is not an abuse to rely upon the fact (if it is a fact) that a
                        liability is not the controller's because it is the company's. On the
                        contrary, that is what incorporation is all about. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Plainly, the law eschews disregard of the
                    separate corporate legal personality of a company except in exceptional
                    circumstances, and only where there has been some form of abuse. Respect for the
                    separate corporate legal personality of a company, with the rights and
                    liabilities attached to that personality, is sacrosanct in nearly every other
                    circumstance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Indeed, the single economic entity concept as
                    argued by Manuchar goes even further than piercing the corporate veil. Manuchar
                    was not merely seeking to claim against Star Pacific on the ground that Star
                    Pacific was the mastermind behind SPL Shipping and because there had been some
                    abuse or impropriety. No allegation of abuse or impropriety was made in Mr
                    Maas’ affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Rather, Manuchar was relying on the single
                    economic entity concept to canvass the argument that the law recognises an
                    overarching indivisible group corporate legal personality that transcends and
                    supersedes all individual members’ separate corporate legal personalities,
                    and upon which rights and liabilities of each member of the group can be
                    attached, with the consequence that the liabilities (and also rights) of a
                    member of the group is shared by other members of the group <em>because</em> of the shared group corporate legal
                personality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In other words, while the movement of
                    liability under the piercing of the corporate veil doctrine is unidirectional
                    (in the direction of the ultimate controller, usually the parent), the movement
                    of liability under the concept of single economic entity argued in this
                    application is multidirectional in that all members of the group share in the
                    same group corporate personality. A subsidiary may be made liable for the
                    liabilities of its sister and parent companies, not because of control, but
                    simply because all these companies belong to the same corporate group. One for
                    all and all for one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Interestingly, Mr Gary Born, a prominent
                    international disputes practitioner and commentator, too, takes the view that
                    the “group of companies” doctrine (at [73] above), which I
                    mentioned earlier is conceptually similar to the single economic entity (though
                    confined primarily to the arbitration context), is fundamentally distinct from
                    the other techniques of disregarding separate legal personality (see <em>Born</em> at p 1449).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Apart from the conceptual difficulties I had
                    with the doctrine as stated above, I was also not persuaded by the case law that
                    the single economic entity concept was recognised under the common law, or at
                    any rate under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   
        <em>Adams</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The leading case on the single economic
                    entity concept is <em>Adams</em>, a decision of the English
                    Court of Appeal. <em>Adams</em> has been cited with
                    approval on numerous occasions in Singapore (see <em>eg</em>, <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> and <em>Win Line (UK) Ltd v Masterpart (Singapore) Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 24 (“<em>Win
                        Line</em>”)). The facts there are rather convoluted but it is
                    worth taking some time to explain the intricacies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The first defendant in that case, Cape,
                    presided over a group of subsidiary companies engaged in the mining and
                    marketing of asbestos. Cape was an English company. The group had a subsidiary
                    responsible for marketing in the US, a US company called NAAC. The group also
                    had a worldwide marketing subsidiary called Capasco, which was an English
                    company. Some workers in a factory belonging to the group suffered injuries as a
                    result of exposure to asbestos dust and consequently sued members of the group
                    in the US. There were two separate actions of which the first was settled. In
                    relation to the second, Cape and Capasco took no part in the US proceedings.
                    They were prepared to let default judgments be entered against them and later
                    resist enforcement of those judgments in England if enforcement was sought
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Default judgment was then entered and the
                    plaintiffs (bar one) sought to enforce the default judgment against Cape and
                    Capasco in England. One of the main issues was whether the US court was entitled
                    to take jurisdiction over Cape and Capasco. The plaintiffs argued that the US
                    court was so entitled because Cape and Capasco were present in the US through
                    NAAC and later, by the creation of two new subsidiaries, AMC, a Liechtenstein
                    company, and CPC, a US company. Both AMC and CPC were involved in marketing
                    asbestos in the US although it was not disputed that AMC had no presence in the
                    US at the material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    At first instance, the High Court held that
                    Cape and Capasco were not present as the presence of NAAC and CPC in the US and
                    the business carried on from their respective offices did not constitute the
                    presence of Cape or Capasco. The plaintiffs then appealed but their appeal was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The plaintiffs submitted (at 532) that Cape,
                    Capasco and CPC, which performed the same functions as those previously carried
                    out by NAAC, constituted a single economic entity and for that reason,
                    CPC’s presence in the US sufficed to constitute the presence of Cape and
                    Capasco. On that submission, Slade LJ who delivered the leading judgment for the
                    Court of Appeal opened (at 532) by referring to Roskill LJ’s exposition in
                        <em>Albacruz (Cargo Owners) v Albazero (Owners)</em>
                    [1977] 1 AC 774 at 807:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [E]ach company in a group of companies (a relatively modern
                        concept) is a separate legal entity possessed of separate legal rights and
                        liabilities so that the rights of one company in a group cannot be exercised
                        by another company in that group even though the ultimate benefit of the
                        exercise of those rights would enure beneficially to the same person or
                        corporate body irrespective of the person or body in whom those rights were
                        vested in law. It is perhaps permissible under modern commercial conditions
                        to regret the existence of these principles. But it is impossible to deny,
                        ignore or disobey them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    A company within a group may enjoy the
                    benefits arising from the exercise of a right vested in another company, but
                    that did not make the two companies one legal entity; they remain separate
                    entities. Applying that logic, Slade LJ therefore held that it was indisputable
                    that each of Cape, Capasco, NAAC and CPC were in law separate legal entities.
                    The law, he said (at 536), for better or worse, recognises the creation of
                    subsidiary companies which (though in one sense are the creatures of their
                    parent companies) would nevertheless fall to be treated as separate legal
                    entities with all the rights and liabilities which would normally attach to
                    separate legal entities. The court was not free to disregard the principle in
                        <em>Salomon</em> merely because it considered that
                    justice so required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The court could see the force of the
                    submission that the set up and operations of the Cape group was such that the
                    group was virtually the same as a partnership in which all the member companies
                    were partners. The court could even accept that the evidence broadly supported
                    the submission that Cape ran a single integrated division with little regard to
                    corporate formalities as between members of the group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    However, Slade LJ held (at 538) that the
                    court had “no discretion to reject the distinction between the members of
                    the group”, a distinction which in law has been said to be fundamental
                    and cannot be bridged (see <em>Bank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon and
                        Another</em> [1987] 1 AC 45 at 64). The distinction Slade LJ was
                    referring to was, of course, the distinction between separate legal
                    personalities of each member of the group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Therefore, the flexibility enjoyed by
                    shareholders to manage the business and liabilities of a company that flows from
                    the principle in <em>Salomon</em> extends to a group of
                    companies. It is entirely within the permissible boundaries of law for a
                    corporate group to use whatever corporate structures are available to organise
                    their legal liability in the most advantageous way, even to the extent of
                    ensuring that legal liability in respect of particular future activities of the
                    group will fall on a specific member of the group rather than another or to the
                    group as a whole (see also <em>China Ocean Shipping Co v Mitrans
                        Shipping Co Ltd</em> [1995] 3 HKC 123 and <em>Ord and
                        another v Belhaven Pubs Ltd</em> [1998] BCC 607). Whether or not it is
                    desirable, the right to use a corporate structure in any manner legally
                    permissible is inherent in our corporate law: see <em>Adams</em> at 544.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    There is an English case, <em>DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough
                        Council</em> [1976] 1 WLR 852 (“<em>DHN
                        Food</em>”), which used to be and is still sometimes cited for
                    the proposition that the law does recognise in limited circumstances the single
                    economic entity concept (for <em>eg</em>, see Thomas K
                    Cheng, “The Corporate Veil Doctrine Revisited: A Comparative Study of the
                    English and the US Corporate Veil Doctrines” (2011) 34 Boston College Int
                    &amp; Comp L Rev 328 at p 388; and Albert Badia, “Piercing the Veil in
                    Municipal Law” in <em>Piercing the Veil of State
                        Enterprises in International Arbitration</em> (Albert Badia ed)
                    (Kluwer, 2014) at pp 63–65).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In that case, a group of three companies,
                    DHN, Bronze and Transport, all in voluntary liquidation at the relevant time,
                    were seeking compensation under the Land Compensation Act 1961 following a
                    compulsory purchase made by the respondent council. DHN held all the shares in
                    Bronze and Transport. The three companies were associated in a wholesale grocery
                    business. DHN was the parent company and owned the business; the land was owned
                    by Bronze; and the vehicles were owned by Transport. The issue was whether DHN
                    and Transport were entitled to compensation for disturbance as a result of the
                    compulsory acquisition of land owned by Bronze by the respondent council. The
                    Lands Tribunal held that DHN were licensees of Bronze and had no claim to
                    compensation beyond a negligible sum permitted by statute. DHN appealed and
                    succeeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Delivering the leading judgment of the
                    English Court of Appeal, Lord Denning MR had this to say (at 860):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Third</em>, <b><em>lifting the corporate veil</em></b>. ... We all know that in many
                        respects a group of companies are treated together for the purpose of
                        general accounts, balance sheet, and profit and loss account. They are
                        treated as one concern. Professor Gower in <em>Modern
                            Company Law</em>, 3rd ed (1969), p 216 says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“there is evidence of a general tendency to ignore the separate
                            legal entities of various companies within a group, and to look instead
                            at the economic entity of the whole group.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is especially the case when a parent company owns all the shares of
                        the subsidiaries – so much so that it can control every movement of
                        the subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are bound hand and foot to the parent
                        company and must do just what the parent company says. A striking instance
                        is the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Harold
                            Holdsworth &amp; Co (Wakefield) Ltd v Caddies</em> [1955] 1
                        WLR 352 . So here. This group is virtually the same as a partnership in
                        which all the three companies are partners. They should not be treated
                        separately so as to be defeated on a technical point. They should not be
                        deprived of the compensation which should justly be payable for disturbance.
                            <em>The three companies should, for present purposes, be
                            treated as one, and the parent company DHN should be treated as that
                            one. So DHN are entitled to claim compensation accordingly</em>.
                        It was not necessary for them to go through a conveyancing device to get
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The main concern of the court in <em>DHN Food</em> was identifying the principal responsible for
                    the business. Judging from the way the business was structured and ran, the
                    court found that DHN was that principal and DHN should therefore be entitled to
                    compensation. On a closer reading of the case, I did not think that any of the
                    judges had advocated a wider, if not wholly new, concept of an overarching group
                    corporate legal personality – under which rights and liabilities accrued
                    to and incurred by each member of the group could be attributed to other members
                    of the group because each member was part of the single economic
                entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Instead of supporting a wider doctrine of
                    single economic entity, <em>DHN Food</em> can be described
                    as a case of “self-piercing” – piercing the corporate veil
                    to gain an advantage (for an elaboration of the idea of self-piercing, see
                    Robert B Thompson, “Piercing the Corporate Veil: An Empirical
                    Study” (1991) 76 Cornell L Rev 1036). Indeed, as the prefatory words to
                    his reasoning (at [113] above) strongly suggest, it seemed to me that Lord
                    Denning similarly considered <em>DHN Food</em> as a case of
                    lifting the corporate veil. He was not relying on a different concept to find in
                    favour of DHN. Goff LJ, too (at 861–862), saw the court’s reversal
                    of the Land Tribunal’s decision as a consequence of the corporate veil
                    being pierced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    But <em>DHN Food</em>
                    is controversial precisely because the lifting of the corporate veil element was
                    not all that apparent, even on a closer examination. Hence, the House of Lords
                    thought it necessary in <em>Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional
                        Council</em> (1978) 38 P&amp;CR 521 (in rejecting the
                    appellants’ submission (at 525–526) that the three companies in
                    question should be treated as a single entity “embodied” in one of
                    the three companies) to express reservations over the Court of Appeal’s
                    application of the piercing of the corporate veil principle in <em>DHN Food</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Any glimmer of hope that the single economic
                    entity concept could subsist under English law was swiftly
                extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   
        <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> and <em>Win Line</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    There is also local jurisprudence on this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Ms Leong in her submissions cited two
                    decisions of the Singapore High Court, namely, <em>Lew Syn
                        Pau</em> and <em>Win Line</em>. Ms Leong cited
                    other cases but I did not find these to be of direct assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I shall begin with <em>Win
                        Line</em>, a decision of Judith Prakash J. The defendant, Masterpart,
                    chartered a vessel owned by the plaintiff, Win Line. Under the charterparty,
                    Masterpart was listed as one of the group of companies of the second defendant,
                    D&amp;M. A dispute over Masterpart’s alleged repudiation of the
                    charterparty arose and Win Line sued both Masterpart and D&amp;M. One of the
                    grounds relied on by Win Line against D&amp;M was that Masterpart and D&amp;M
                    were run as a single corporate entity and were therefore jointly liable for the
                    breach of the charterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Based on my reading of her judgment, Prakash
                    J was obviously alive to the distinction between the piercing of the corporate
                    veil doctrine and the single economic entity concept. Her characterisation of
                    Win Line’s submission is essentially identical to how I understood the
                    Plaintiff’s submission here. Prakash J said (at [43]–[44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiffs also submitted that the evidence disclosed that Masterpart
                        and D&amp;M were organised as one economic entity <em>and for
                            that reason it would be correct to make D&amp;M responsible for the
                            liabilities nominally incurred by Masterpart</em>. That argument
                        is one that has been made in previous cases <em>to justify
                            lifting the corporate veil</em> that exists between a parent
                        company and its subsidiaries within the same group. Even in such a situation
                        the argument has not been well received. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[W]hat the plaintiffs wish me to do here is to
                            </em><b><em>extend the principle [of piercing the
                            corporate veil in a group of companies] into a completely different area
                            and treat two companies which have no common shareholders or directors
                            as being a single economic unit and thus a single legal unit. I cannot
                            do this.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Prakash J then went on to state that,
                        <em>in any event</em>, Masterpart and D&amp;M were not
                    a single economic unit on the facts. It may be that Prakash J’s
                    examination of the facts gave Ms Leong the confidence to submit that <em>Win Line</em> stands for the proposition that under Singapore
                    law, “two companies can be found to be a single economic entity in the
                    appropriate circumstances”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I did not read <em>Win
                        Line</em> in this way. It was clear to me that Prakash J had rejected,
                    as a matter of principle, the submission by Win Line that liability ought to be
                    found against D&amp;M on the basis that Masterpart and D&amp;M were part of a
                    single economic entity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Compared to <em>Win
                        Line</em>, the facts of <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> are
                    much further from the present case. The broad issue in question was whether a
                    company, BIGL, had committed an offence by giving prohibited financial
                    assistance to a purchaser for the acquisition of BIGL’s shares. Under the
                    law, a company which is the target of an intended acquisition is prohibited,
                    subject to certain statutory exceptions, from directly or indirectly giving any
                    financial assistance for the purposes of or in connection with the acquisition.
                    The financial assistance in <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> took the
                    form of a loan by one of BIGL’s subsidiaries, Compart
                Mauritius.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was)
                    considered (at [193]) that one way in which BIGL might be found to have given
                    financial assistance indirectly was if the corporate veil between BIGL and
                    Compart Mauritius could be pierced <em>such that</em> the
                    acts of Compart Mauritius were to be treated as the acts of BIGL. I pause here
                    to highlight again the distinction between the piercing of the corporate veil
                    concept and the single entity economic entity concept. The situation in
                        <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> was, as Menon JC rightly
                    characterised, a case of piercing the corporate veil because what was sought to
                    be done was to attribute the act of a company to its controller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    There was no argument or discussion to the
                    effect that <em>because</em> Compart Mauritius and BIGL,
                    together with other entities, operated as a single economic entity, each
                    belonged to that single economic entity with the consequence that the acts and
                    liabilities of each of the companies in that entity may be attributed to the
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In deciding whether the corporate veil ought
                    to be pierced, Menon JC noted (at [195]) the concession by both parties’
                    counsel that the separate corporate legal personality principle presented a
                    considerable obstacle to a finding that the act of Compart Mauritius was to be
                    taken as an act of BIGL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Menon JC nevertheless went on to review a
                    handful of authorities, including <em>Win Line</em>, at the
                    end of which he concluded (at [202]) that the ordering of companies within a
                    broader group structure did not mean that one could dispense with the need to
                    view and understand each entity in the group as a separate legal entity. I
                    agreed with this statement of principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Before I leave this discussion on the
                    position under Singapore law, it should be noted that <em>Walter
                        Woon on Company Law</em> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 2.81 opines that the “courts are <em>far yet</em> from deciding that a group of companies is one
                    super entity encompassing all the companies within the group” [emphasis
                    added]. As far as I am aware, cases decided post-2009 (<em>Win
                        Line</em> and <em>Lew Syn Pau</em> were decided
                    in 1999 and 2006 respectively) have not added very much to this area of company
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   One-ship companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The law’s take on the legitimacy of
                    one-ship companies provides another reason why the single economic entity
                    concept has no place in Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It has been long and well established that
                    one-ship companies are a legitimate practice for businesses engaged in the
                    shipping business to limit their liability: see <em>The
                        “Skaw Prince”</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 146 at [19]; and
                        <em>Cavenagh Investment Pte Ltd v Kaushik Rajiv</em>
                    [2013] 2 SLR 543 at [41]. While exceptional circumstances indicating the
                    presence of a façade or a sham may sometimes warrant the lifting of the
                    corporate veil against a one-ship company (<em>Antonio Gramsci
                        Shipping Corporation and others v Stepanovs</em> [2011] EWHC 333), the
                    general position that a one-ship company is not liable for losses caused by a
                    sister ship owned under another company reinforces the <em>Salomon</em> principle (see Francis Rose, “Raising the
                    Corporate Sail” [2013] LMCLQ 565 at p 577).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Thus, it was said in <em>Chimbusco Pan Nation Petro-Chemical Co Ltd v The Owners and/or Demise
                        Charterers of the Ship or Vessel “Decurio”</em> [2013] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 407 at [68] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… notwithstanding the widespread use of one-ship shipowning
                        companies controlled by a parent company, courts do not as a general course
                        lift the corporate veil ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    If the single economic entity concept were
                    accepted, all such one-ship companies would be considered as part of the same
                    single economic entity with the corollary that the liability of a one-ship
                    company may be visited on several (or all) of its other one-ship sister
                    companies. The existence of abusive conduct becomes irrelevant because liability
                    can be established by the mere fact of the existence of a group structure; the
                    piercing of the corporate veil exception would not even be needed. In short,
                    there would be no place for the survival of the one-ship companies practice and
                    doctrine which has long existed and recognised as a legitimate tool for limiting
                    liability.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Last but not least, I should mention that as
                    far as I could tell, the single economic entity concept has not received
                    endorsement under US corporate law (see Virginia Harper Ho, “Theories of
                    Corporate Groups: Corporate Identity Reconceived” (2012) Seton Hall L Rev
                    879 at pp 880–881). A sprinkling of cases mention (with approval) a
                    similar doctrine loosely described as “enterprise liability”, but
                    on the whole, my assessment of the cases in the US was that the single economic
                    entity concept in the context of company law was not clearly
                settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Apart from the Dow Chemical arbitration case
                    which I mentioned in passing above (see [72] and [73] above), I found that the
                    single economic entity concept had very little traction in the international
                    arbitration community, especially outside jurisdictional issues (such as whether
                    a company within the group is part of the group for the purposes of
                    jurisdiction). I found particularly helpful the tribunal’s summary in the
                    investment treaty arbitration case of <em>CME Czech Republic BV v
                        The Czech Republic</em> (Final Award, dated 14 March 2003 at para
                    436):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Only in exceptional cases, in particular in competition law, have
                        tribunals or law courts accepted a concept of a
                        ‘single economic entity’, which allows discounting of
                        the separate legal existences of the shareholder and the company, mostly, to
                        allow the joining of a parent of a subsidiary to an arbitration. Also a
                        ‘company group’ theory is not generally accepted in
                        international arbitration (although promoted by prominent authorities) and
                        there are no precedents of which this Tribunal is aware for its general
                        acceptance. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    For all the foregoing reasons, I was not
                    persuaded, on balance, that the single economic entity concept was recognised at
                    law in Singapore nor was there a good legal basis to support its
                    recognition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I therefore dismissed the application,
                    though I granted Manuchar’s application for leave to appeal to the Court
                    of Appeal. I awarded costs of $3,000 in total to Star Pacific, of which $1,000
                    was for a round of further arguments pursuant to s 28B of the SCJA (which
                    Manuchar sought after I had given my decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In addition, since Mr Ham had consistently
                    insisted on oath that he did not have the documents anyway, in the interests of
                    saving time and costs and with the consent of both parties, I gave Mr Ham leave
                    to file an affidavit <em>as if</em> I had granted
                    Manuchar’s application. This was done but Manuchar remained unsatisfied
                    because Mr Ham only affirmed that Star Pacific did not have the documents since
                    19 July 2010, which was the date that he took over as director and owner of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Finally, in fairness to Manuchar and for the
                    avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have decided stands in the way of Manuchar
                    commencing action against Star Pacific on any of the grounds that it had
                    intimated in the course of the application.</p>
