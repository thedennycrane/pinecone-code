<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The assessment of damages is almost always of the first importance to
                    plaintiffs (including the plaintiff in the present proceedings). This is only
                    natural given that a plaintiff who has been legally wronged would surely want to
                    know how the wrong (or wrongs) is (or are) to be redressed (often, as is the
                    case here, in monetary terms). It has also commonly been said – quite
                    correctly, in our view – that the assessment of damages is not a
                    mechanistic process. To be sure, there are legal rules and principles which
                    guide the court. However, their <em>application</em> is
                    often not an easy process. As we shall see, this is in fact precisely the
                    situation in the present proceedings. There have been clear – and
                    continuing – breaches on the part of the defendants (who are the
                    appellants in both the appeals before us (“the Appellants”)).
                    However, the Appellants have sought – most vigorously, in fact
                        - to convince us that, notwithstanding their blatant
                    breaches of contract (and see below at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>–<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>), the
                    plaintiff’s (who is the respondent in both appeals (“the
                    Respondent”)) loss is unconnected with such breaches. Indeed, much of the
                    argument before this court was spent on the issue of causation – or,
                    rather, the absence of causation, in so far as the Appellants are
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellants also had a fallback argument: if, indeed, their breaches had
                    caused loss to the Respondent, the Respondent (so the argument ran) was
                    nevertheless the main author of its loss. In essence, the thrust of the
                    Appellants’ argument is that the Respondent was already suffering from a
                    decline in sales in any event and, hence, is not entitled to seek substantial
                    monetary compensation (in the form of damages) from the Appellants. The
                    Appellants say that the Respondent can (at best) claim only a relatively small
                    amount of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There is yet another – albeit more subsidiary – issue. However,
                    even this issue sees the Appellants attempting to argue that damages should be
                    denied to the Respondent. This relates to loss or damage that was allegedly
                    caused to the Respondent <em>after</em> the breaches of
                    contract, <em>viz</em>, the <em>post-</em>breach situation. In particular, the Appellants have sought
                    to argue that the loss in <em>this</em> particular
                    situation is <em>too remote</em>. Although, as just
                    mentioned, this is not one of the main issues in the present appeal, it
                    certainly raises the spectre of a recent House of Lords decision, at least part
                    of which differs (quite radically) in legal orientation from a decision of this
                    court. As the <em>legal principles</em> involved are of the
                    first importance for future cases, and the legal conundrum emanates from the
                    highest appellate court in England, we must deal with it in the present appeals
                    – not least because if, in particular, one of the legal propositions made
                    in the House of Lords decision is correct, then the law which has stood for a
                    century and a half (and which has been endorsed by this court) will change (and
                    rather radically at that).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The result of all this is a curious compendium of both difficult issues of
                    application as well as a difficult issue of law. In short, both particulars and
                    universals have raised rather thorny questions that we must resolve. What began
                    as a deceptively simple set of legal proceedings has metamorphosed into a rather
                    complex mixture of factual and legal conundrums impacting on the issue of
                    justice and fairness not only for the parties to the present appeals but also
                    (in relation to the legal rules and principles centring on remoteness of damage)
                    for future litigants as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is best, in the circumstances, to begin from the beginning – in
                    particular, with the basic factual matrix which constitutes the backdrop against
                    which the various legal issues have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The present appeals are against the decision made by the High Court Judge
                    (“the Judge”) with regard to the assessment of damages in
                        <em>Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd v MFM
                        Restaurants Pte Ltd and another</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1104
                    (“the Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Respondent is Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd, the owner of a
                    chain of seafood restaurants called “Fish &amp; Co”. The
                    original assessment hearing had, in fact, taken place before an Assistant
                    Registrar (“the AR”), whose decision was appealed against by the
                    Respondent and cross-appealed by the Appellants. As we shall see, the Judge
                    allowed the Respondent’s appeal and dismissed the cross-appeal by the
                    Appellants. The first appellant is MFM Restaurants Pte Ltd (“the First
                    Appellant”), the owner of another chain of seafood restaurants called
                    “The Manhattan Fish Market” (“MFM”) and the second
                    appellant is Dickson Low (“Dickson”), a former employee of the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As part of his employment contract with the Respondent, Dickson agreed that
                    all confidential information derived during his employment would not be wilfully
                    divulged to outside parties and competitors, and that he would not help to set
                    up restaurants other than for the Respondent during his employment or two years
                    after resigning from the company. Sometime after resigning from the Respondent
                    (around 21 August 2001), Dickson was involved in and helped to set up the
                    First Appellant’s business. The first MFM restaurant was opened in
                    Malaysia in 2002 and subsequently more restaurants were opened in Malaysia.
                    Following these events, on 30 March 2004, the Respondent brought
                    proceedings against Dickson for breaching the non-competition obligations in the
                    contract of employment by using and divulging confidential information. The
                    Respondent alleged that Dickson copied Fish &amp; Co’s concepts
                    for use in the MFM restaurants. Dickson denied the allegations. However, during
                    the course of the trial, the parties settled and recorded a settlement deed on
                    27 April 2005 (“the Settlement Deed”). The First Appellant
                    and its Malaysian counterparts were also added as parties to the Settlement
                    Deed, although they were not parties to the suit. The Respondent claimed that it
                    required the First Appellant’s inclusion to ensure that both Dickson and
                    the First Appellant were prevented from employing
                    Fish &amp; Co’s concepts. This was especially important as it
                    was found out during the course of trial that the First Appellant was planning
                    to open the first MFM restaurant in Singapore. The relevant sub-clauses in the
                    Settlement Deed for our purposes read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Parties hereby undertake to fulfill the following obligations:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    [The Appellants] undertake not to use, in the Manhattan Fish
                                Market Restaurants around the world, within a period of four (4)
                                months from the date of this Deed, serving pans identical and/or
                                similar to those serving pans used in Fish &amp; Co
                                Restaurants.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   [The Appellants] undertake not to use any slogans and/or jingles
                                identical to or confusingly similar to that used by [the Respondent]
                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   ...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   [The Appellants] undertake not to use the words and/or phrases
                                more particularly described in Schedule 3 …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    [The Appellants] undertake, within a period of three (3) months
                                from this Deed, to use a completely different garlic lemon butter
                                sauce, sauce used in the dish known as “Garlic Lemon
                                Mussels” … (collectively known as “the MFM
                                Sauces”) … from the Garlic Lemon Butter Sauce and
                                Lemon Butter Sauces used in Fish &amp; Co Restaurants
                                (“the O.B. Sauces”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The four obligations will be referred to herein as “the Pans
                    undertaking”, “the Slogans undertaking”, “the
                    Phrases undertaking” and “the Sauces undertaking”,
                    respectively. The Respondent claimed that the four undertakings were crucial as
                    they reflected the essence of the Fish &amp; Co concept. The Slogans
                    and Phrases undertakings were to take effect from 27 April 2005, while the
                    Sauces undertaking was to take effect from 27 July 2005, with the Pans
                    undertaking taking effect from 27 August 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subsequently, on 20 May 2005, the First Appellant began operations at
                    Plaza Singapura, which was just 0.28 km away from the Respondent’s
                    Fish &amp; Co Glass House outlet situated at Penang Road. The
                    Respondent alleged that despite the undertakings in the Settlement Deed, the
                    Appellants had almost immediately breached cl 3 of the Settlement Deed
                    by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     using the slogan “<em>One bite and you’re
                            hooked</em>” on its menus (this was one out of the
                        31 slogans/jingles which the Appellants agreed to refrain from
                        using);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     using the phrases “<em>Garlic Lemon
                            Butter</em>”, “<em>Lemon
                            Butter</em>” and “<em>Creamy Garlic
                            Lemon</em>” on its website;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     failing to use completely different sauces; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     using serving pans which were similar to the serving pans used by
                        Fish &amp; Co. The Respondent alleged that the black pans used by
                        MFM were similar to the pans used by Fish &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 20 September 2005, the Respondent brought proceedings against the
                    Appellants for the above breaches. The Respondent claimed an injunction as well
                    as damages pursuant to the alleged breaches of the Settlement Deed. The claim
                    was (as mentioned) premised on the breaches of the Settlement Deed, and not for
                    passing off or breach of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Around 8 November 2005, MFM discontinued the use of the disputed slogan
                    and phrases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the first day of trial, <em>viz</em>, 27 November
                    2006, the Appellants agreed to enter into a consent judgment, with damages to be
                    assessed (“the Consent Judgment”). The Appellants also agreed to
                    the terms of an injunction. The relevant portions of the Consent Judgment read
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    [The Appellants] have 45 days from the date of this Judgment
                            (i.e. up to Wednesday 10 January 2007) to effect the change in the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As may be observed, the terms of the injunction were based on the undertakings
                    in the Settlement Deed, and as prayed for by the Respondent in its statement of
                    claim. Pursuant to the Consent Judgment, MFM stopped using the pans on
                    28 December 2006. There were some disputes as to whether the Appellants had
                    complied with the Sauces undertaking by January 2007. However, for the purposes
                    of this suit and the assessment of damages, the Respondent has not claimed
                    damages for any breaches which allegedly occurred after January 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before we proceed further, we would like to note the Appellants’ conduct
                    throughout the breach period. We agree with the Judge’s view that the
                    breaches were “deliberate” and constituted “flagrant
                    contravention of the [Appellants’] undertakings with a view to their own
                    financial gain or reward” (see the Judgment at [37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Respondent alleged that despite the fact that it had sent numerous
                    reminders to the Appellants to remind them of their legal obligations pursuant
                    to the Settlement Deed, the Appellants did not act on the matter. This left it
                    with little choice but to commence legal proceedings against the Appellants on
                    20 September 2005. Before us, the Appellants took pains to emphasise that
                    the breaches of the undertakings were not deliberate. The Appellants contended
                    that, having been notified by the Respondent through its solicitor’s
                    letter dated 5 July 2005 of the breaches of the Slogans and Phrases
                    undertakings, the Appellants promptly responded and stopped the breaches by the
                    first week of November 2005. We question, however, if it was necessary to take
                    four months for this to be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Even if we accept that the Appellants acted promptly with regard to the
                    Slogans and Phrases undertakings, the breaches of the Sauces and Pans
                    undertakings presented quite a different situation. In particular, we find that
                    there was a deliberate attempt by the Appellants to disregard the Settlement
                    Deed. The Appellants contended that, to comply with the Sauces undertaking, MFM
                    varied its sauce, for example, by using margarine instead of butter, and by
                    using freshly squeezed bottled lemon instead of lemon concentrate, as well as by
                    varying the quantities of the various ingredients. The Appellants further
                    contended that the reason for the delay in compliance with the relevant terms of
                    the Settlement Deed was due to the parties’ inability to agree on who to
                    appoint as a neutral third party taste expert. The Respondent claimed that, as a
                    neutral third party could not be agreed upon, this option was no longer pursued
                    upon the commencement of the suit. It is noted that, pursuant to cl 3(xiii)
                    of the Settlement Deed, parties were at liberty to commence legal proceedings in
                    the event that the identity of the neutral third party was not agreed upon. The
                    Respondent also stated that joint attempts to appoint a court expert after the
                    suit commenced likewise failed. In our view, the inability to jointly appoint a
                    neutral third party (and subsequently a court expert) which both parties could
                    agree upon is hardly a satisfactory reason for breaching the Sauces undertaking
                    given that the Appellants could, if they were minded to do so, have easily
                    lengthened the process by not agreeing to any of the experts proposed by the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In so far as the Pans undertaking was concerned, the Appellants explained that
                    the Respondent’s Fish &amp; Co outlets in Singapore have ceased
                    to use black pans and had changed to stainless steel pans. Therefore, the
                    Appellants were under the impression that it would be able to retain the use of
                    black pans in its restaurants. In fact, even in their submissions before this
                    court, the Appellants sought to assert that, despite entering into the Consent
                    Judgment, they were not admitting to liability for breaching the Pans
                    undertaking, which we found to be odd given that they had agreed for damages to
                    be assessed and did not refute their liabilities for breaching the other three
                    undertakings. In any case, we find the Appellants’ explanations to be
                    unconvincing. The issue of the pans had already been raised in the earlier
                    proceedings taken out by the Respondent against Dickson for the alleged breach
                    of his employment contract. Part of the reason for the grace period factored
                    into the Settlement Deed was precisely to accord the Appellants adequate time to
                    comply with the agreement. Further, we find that it was not sufficient that the
                    Appellants used different coloured pans, given that what was more significant
                    (and, indeed, that was what the undertakings in the Settlement Deed were
                    targeted at) was the concept of serving food out of a pan. Indeed, it was not
                    necessary for the Appellants to use identical serving pans before they could be
                    in breach of cl 3(i) of the Settlement Deed, so long as the pans themselves
                    were similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Further, we note that the Appellants waited till the <em>first
                        day of trial</em> before consenting to judgment (and admitting
                    liability). Considering the totality of the evidence, we find that the
                    Appellants had deliberately ignored their undertakings in the Settlement Deed
                    with the intention of profiteering from the breaches. The Appellants also sought
                    to downplay the significance of the undertakings by contending that they were
                    minor, and did not impact on the minds of the consumers. However, if this was
                    so, we question the Appellants’ decision to contest the suit so vigorously
                    only to concede liability on the first day of trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The assessment of damages before the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Before the AR, the Respondent claimed damages for two time periods. The first
                    was the period between August 2005 and January 2007 (“the Breach
                    Period”), <em>ie</em>, when the breaches occurred.
                    The second was the period thereafter (“the Post-Breach Period”),
                        <em>ie</em>, when the breaches had ceased but its
                    effects continued to result in losses to the Respondent. However, as noted
                    above, the Slogans and Phrases undertakings were complied with by the first week
                    of November 2005 (<em>ie</em>, before January 2007). In the
                    circumstances, therefore, the terms “the Breach Period” and
                    “the Post-Breach Period” are not, strictly speaking, accurate.
                    However, given the way in which the arguments were made as well as for
                    convenience of exposition, we will make reference to these two time
                    periods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issue of causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Respondent alleged that, as a result of the non-compliances with the
                    Settlement Deed, there was no differentiation between MFM and
                    Fish &amp; Co restaurants, resulting in misrepresentation and
                    confusion in the market. Therefore, Fish &amp; Co’s sales were
                    affected by the Appellants’ breaches. Further, as a result of the
                    non-compliances, MFM had gained an accelerated entry into the market and could
                    therefore gain market share quickly by stealing Fish &amp; Co’s
                    market share and sales, thereby diluting the Respondent’s goodwill in the
                    Fish &amp; Co concept. Essentially, the Respondent relied on empirical
                    evidence that its profits had been reduced since the inception of MFM to
                    demonstrate that the Appellants’ breaches had caused its losses. The
                    Respondent further relied on the English decision of <em>Draper v
                        Trist and Tristbestos Brake Linings, Ld</em> (1939) 56 RPC 429, a
                    case involving passing-off, to argue that the innocent party need not adduce
                    evidence of confusion in order to recover substantial damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Appellants argued that consenting to judgment did not amount to an
                    admission that any damages were payable upon an assessment, and that, therefore,
                    the burden of proof remained on the Respondent to prove its losses. The
                    Appellants alleged that the Respondent had not discharged its burden of proof.
                    First, the Respondent’s Fish &amp; Co restaurants were already
                    making losses before the Breach Period. Second, the Respondent had not adduced
                    evidence, through (for example) a market survey to demonstrate the alleged
                    effects of the Appellants’ breaches. Third, the losses suffered by the
                    Respondent subsequent to the Breach Period (<em>ie</em>,
                    during the Post-Breach Period) were too remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The methodologies employed to estimate the Respondent’s loss of
                profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Each party also appointed its own expert witness to calculate the damages owed
                    by the Appellants to the Respondent. The expert witness for the Respondent,
                    Mr Tony Samuel (“Mr Samuel”), proposed two measures of
                    calculations, which he termed as Methods A and B, respectively. Before
                    describing the basis of both calculations, it must be noted that
                    Mr Samuel’s quantification of damages was premised on the assumption
                    that the Respondent did in fact suffer losses during the Breach and Post-Breach
                    Periods as a result of the Appellants’ breaches of the Settlement Deed.
                    Mr Samuel’s calculations cannot therefore be employed to determine
                    the causation issue, although, to the extent that a trend of loss in profits can
                    be observed, that would be part of the empirical evidence and therefore add
                    credence to the allegation that the Respondent’s profits were affected by
                    the Appellants’ breaches. For convenience of exposition, the explanation
                    below of Methods A and B will assume that all of the Respondent’s
                    lost profits may be attributed to the Appellants’ breaches. The actual
                    extent of the Respondent’s loss of profits attributable to the
                    Appellants’ breaches will be discussed further later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Method A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Method A involved a comparison of the sales figures for
                    Fish &amp; Co restaurants affected by the Appellants’ actions
                    with the sales figures of Fish &amp; Co restaurants which were
                        <em>not</em> affected by the same actions.
                    Method A assumed that, but for the Appellants’ actions, the relative
                    performance of both sets of restaurants would have been consistent during the
                    pre-breach period from February 2004 to August 2005 (“the Pre-Breach
                    Period”), as well as the Breach and Post-Breach Periods. First,
                    Mr Samuel assumed that four of the Respondent’s city-based
                    Fish &amp; Co outlets, <em>viz</em>, the outlets
                    at Glass House, Bugis Junction, Centrepoint Shopping Centre
                    (“Centrepoint”) and Suntec City Mall (“the Affected
                    Restaurants”) were affected by the Appellants’ actions and that
                    four of its suburban outlets, <em>viz</em>, Novena Square,
                    Jurong Point Shopping Centre, Tampines Mall and Parkway Parade (“the
                    Unaffected Restaurants”) were not affected. A fifth city outlet at
                    Wheelock Place was not included in the calculations as it only commenced
                    business during the Breach Period. The distances of the Affected Restaurants and
                    Wheelock Place from the First Appellant’s MFM restaurant at Plaza
                    Singapura are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Samuel then compared the average monthly sales of the Affected
                    Restaurants with the average monthly sales of the Unaffected Restaurants for a
                    period before, and a period after, the MFM restaurant opened. Based on this
                    data, he found that, during the Pre-Breach Period, the sales of the Affected
                    Restaurant exceeded the sales of the Unaffected Restaurants by an average
                    percentage difference of 14.9 per cent. He undertook the same exercise for
                    the Breach Period and derived an average percentage of 3.8 per cent. Based
                    on the assumptions made, Mr Samuel concluded that, but for the
                    Appellants’ actions, the average sales of the Affected Restaurants would
                    have continued to exceed the average sales of the Unaffected Restaurants by
                    14.9 per cent. He then deducted an estimate of the additional costs and
                    expenses that Fish &amp; Co would have had to incur to earn the
                    additional revenue in order to determine lost profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Employing this methodology, Mr Samuel found that
                    Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits during the Breach Period
                    amounted to $553,100.12. As for the quantification of <em>post</em>-breach losses, Method A was utilised by multiplying an
                    estimated average loss per month by half the number of months it was assumed
                    that MFM would have benefitted. The reason half the number of months were used
                    in this last mentioned regard was to factor in a tapering decrease in influence
                    of the breaches, <em>ie</em>, that the further removed from
                    the time the breaches occurred, the less their influence on
                    Fish &amp; Co’s sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Method B</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Method B assumed that part of the revenue earned by MFM was a result of
                    the Appellants’ breaches and sought to calculate
                    Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits by multiplying the revenue
                    earned by MFM as a result of the breaches by the profit margin that
                    Fish &amp; Co would have made on that revenue. Mr Samuel first
                    calculated the variable profit margin of Fish &amp; Co, that is, the
                    proportion of its revenue which Fish &amp; Co earns as profits (taking
                    into account the cost of food and other variable expenses). He then made another
                    assumption that a certain proportion of the revenue earned by MFM was
                    attributable to the breaches. However, he was unable to determine the exact
                    proportion of MFM’s revenue that was attributable to the breaches, and
                    thus he assumed and utilised a range of 10–50 per cent. The profit
                    margin was then applied to this range of percentages (of MFM’s revenue
                    attributable to the breaches) to derive a range of loss of profits for
                    Fish &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Employing this methodology, Mr Samuel found that the variable profit
                    margin was 52.38 per cent, excluding rent adjustments. In other words, if,
                    as found by Mr Samuel, MFM’s actual sales during the Breach Period
                    amounted to $3,007,500, this would have translated to $697,400 of lost profits
                    for Fish &amp; Co (with rent adjustments), assuming that 50 per
                    cent of MFM’s revenue was attributable to the breaches and that all the
                    revenue earned by MFM would have been earned by
                        Fish &amp; Co.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In so far as the Post-Breach Period was concerned, this was again
                    calculated by multiplying an estimated average loss per month by half the
                    effective number of months it was assumed that MFM would benefit, and
                    Fish &amp; Co would (correspondingly) suffer from the breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Mr Sajjad Ahmad Akhtar’s report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Appellants’ expert report was presented by Mr Sajjad Ahmad
                    Akhtar (“Mr Akhtar”). He compared the sales for the month for
                    each of the Respondent’s Fish &amp; Co outlets with the
                    corresponding sales for the month in the previous year. He opined that, if the
                    Appellants’ breaches had affected Fish &amp; Co’s sales, a
                    pattern showing a steady growth trend in sales during the Pre-Breach Period, a
                    decline during the Breach Period, followed by a rise after the Breach Period
                    would have been seen. As this was not present, Mr Akhtar concluded that the
                    breaches had no significant financial impact on Fish &amp; Co’s
                    sales performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The AR’s decision on methodology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With respect to the issue of causation, the AR found, firstly, that the type
                    of damages sought by the Respondent were not too remote, and were in the
                    reasonable contemplation of the parties as constituting the result of the
                    breaches at the time the Settlement Deed was entered into. Secondly, he found
                    that the only outlet affected by the Appellants’ breaches was the Glass
                    House outlet. This was based on the Respondent’s witnesses’ own
                    evidence that cannibalisation was minimal as each outlet occupied a different
                    market segment and that such factors were considered before the decision was
                    taken to open a new outlet. Thus, the First Appellant’s MFM outlet at
                    Plaza Singapura would only have affected the Respondent’s
                    Fish &amp; Co outlet within the same market segment, <em>viz</em>, the Glass House outlet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In so far as the question of quantification of damages was concerned, the AR
                    also found that it would be more appropriate to adopt <em>Method A</em> as it centred on the losses to
                    Fish &amp; Co, as opposed to <em>Method B</em> which centred on the profits of MFM. Secondly,
                    taking a commonsense approach, and emphasising, in particular, the significance
                    of Fish &amp; Co’s “Seafood in a Pan” concept but
                    taking into account MFM as genuine competition independent of the breaches, the
                    AR held that it would be just to attribute 60 per cent of the losses caused
                    to the Respondent by the breaches of the Appellants. Thirdly, the Respondent
                    would also be entitled to damages based on a period of 12 months after the
                    breaches had stopped as 12 months was a reasonable time for the public to
                    realise that the breaches had ceased and that MFM restaurants were distinct from
                    Fish &amp; Co restaurants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the circumstances, the AR ordered that Method A be utilised, <em>albeit using new parameters</em> (this will be referred to as
                        <em>Method C</em> in this judgment). In other
                    words, Method C employed the methodology in Method A, but changed its
                    assumptions. Under Method C, Glass House would be the only outlet affected,
                    and its sales were to be compared with the other three city-based outlets,
                        <em>viz</em>, the outlets at Bugis Junction,
                    Centrepoint and Suntec City Mall, which were unaffected by the breaches
                    (“the New Unaffected Restaurants”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Method C</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Samuel was of the view that Method C was unsafe. This was
                    because, whereas in his earlier calculations (under Method A), the
                    performance of the (original four) Unaffected Restaurants was fairly consistent,
                    with the new parameters, the performance of one outlet (Centrepoint) was clearly
                    not aligned with that of the (other) New Unaffected Restaurants. He was
                    therefore of the view that the Centrepoint outlet appeared to be affected by
                    events which did not affect the other two outlets and, therefore, its inclusion
                    in the equation would distort the calculation of loss, unless it could be
                    determined whether the unexplained event or events were equally relevant to
                    Glass House. He also observed that the decline in the performances of the Suntec
                    City Mall and Bugis Junction outlets in the five months up to January 2007
                    needed to be explained, as they contributed substantially to the overall average
                    results of the restaurants during the Breach Period. Therefore, he was of the
                    view that it would be unsafe to use Method C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Based on Mr Akhtar’s calculations, in eight of the 18 months
                    during the Breach Period, Glass House in fact derived more revenue than the
                    revenue it estimated that it would obtain had there been no breach. Offsetting
                    the gains from the losses, Mr Akhtar was of the opinion that, on the basis
                    that 60 per cent of Fish &amp; Co’s loss of revenue was
                    attributable to MFM, the Respondent should be awarded $14,060.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr Samuel, on the other hand, was of the view that Mr Akhtar’s
                    calculations demonstrated precisely why Method C was unsafe, since it would
                    be illogical that in eight of the 18 months, Glass House performed better
                    than it was predicted to have performed without MFM’s presence, given the
                    finding that the Appellants’ breaches had caused loss to
                    Fish &amp; Co.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The AR’s final decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The AR relied on Mr Akhtar’s calculations in arriving at his final
                    decision in respect of the application of Method C to the fact situation
                    before him. However, he was of the view that it was not necessary to set off the
                    gains made from the losses, as, under contract law, the plaintiff was entitled
                    to damages arising from a breach but need not pay over its profits. Therefore,
                    the AR awarded a total sum of $72,688 to the Respondent. The AR further awarded
                    costs on an indemnity basis based on the agreement between the parties under the
                    Settlement Deed. As the Respondent reasonably supposed that damages awarded
                    would be within the High Court’s jurisdiction, the AR awarded such costs
                    based on the High Court scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeals against the AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Appellants appealed against the whole of the AR’s decision. Just as
                    they had earlier contended before the AR, the Appellants argued that there was
                    no evidence of loss suffered by the Respondent as a result of their breaches.
                    They further submitted that the Respondent (and the AR) wrongly applied
                    passing-off arguments to the present claim, which was based, instead, on a
                    breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Respondent cross-appealed on the ground that the damages awarded by the AR
                    were too low. It contended that the AR should have applied Method A with
                    the original parameters unchanged; that the proportion of the Respondent’s
                    loss of profits attributable to the Appellants’ breaches should be at
                    least 80 per cent (as opposed to 60 per cent); and that the
                    Post-Breach Period should be increased to between 18 and 24 months (as
                    opposed to 12 months as held by the AR).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge agreed that passing-off principles should not be employed in a
                    breach of contract case. Nevertheless, on the issue of causation, the Judge held
                    that actual loss as a result of the Appellants’ breaches could properly be
                    inferred from the evidence. First, the undertakings in the Settlement Deed were
                    closely related to the business operations of Fish &amp; Co, and,
                    hence, the loss of business was the best evidence of loss. Secondly, the
                    breaches continued for 18 months despite the Respondent’s demands
                    that the Appellants desist. Thirdly, MFM’s performance as a new entrant in
                    the market was exceedingly good. Fourthly, there had been no cannibalisation of
                    Fish &amp; Co’s profits by the opening of its outlets in close
                    proximity to each other. Fifthly, Glass House was the only affected outlet.
                    Sixthly, MFM’s arrival had a negative impact on the Glass House outlet.
                    During the Breach Period, Fish &amp; Co’s average monthly sales
                    were 6.6 per cent below those during the prior 18 month period.
                    Further, Glass House’s sales statistics were significantly underperforming
                    in relation to the industry average, based on the Department of Statistics
                    Catering Trade Index. Seventhly, losses during the Breach and Post-Breach
                    Periods were reasonably contemplated to be the likely consequences of the
                    breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the issue of quantum, the Judge agreed with Mr Samuel that
                    Method C distorted the methodology of Method A. Therefore, she chose
                    to base her quantification of damages on <em>Method B</em>. She found that the most crucial and relevant
                    information were the sales figures. She agreed that it would be unsafe to award
                    Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits based on all of MFM’s
                    sales during the Breach Period, but that it would be logical to infer that if
                    the Appellants had not committed the breaches, Fish &amp; Co’s
                    sales would at least be in line with industry’s trend (which was
                    12 per cent based on the monthly sales percentage year on year change at
                    current prices during that period according to the Department of Statistics
                    Press Releases (see below at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>)). In
                    fact, Glass House’s monthly sales percentage during the Breach Period was
                    -4 per cent. Therefore, there was a 16 per cent gap between Glass
                    House’s sales and the industry average and, for Glass House’s sales
                    to be in line with that industry, its sales would have to be increased by
                    16 per cent. In the circumstances, she awarded damages based on 16 per
                    cent of MFM’s sales during the Breach Period. As for the Post-Breach
                    Period loss of profits, the Judge held that it was within the reasonable
                    contemplation of the parties that the effect of the Appellants’ breaches
                    would continue after the breaches had stopped. However, the Judge reduced the
                    Post-Breach Period from 12 to 6 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Based on the above reasoning, the Judge awarded a total of $269,000 damages to
                    the Respondent. The Appellants appealed against the Judge’s decision in
                    both the Registrar’s Appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments in the present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We now come to the present appeals. The Appellants appealed on the ground that
                    the Judge erred in establishing causation by inferences from the relevant
                    evidence. First, they contended that the fact that Fish &amp; Co was
                    already making losses before the Breach Period shows that its alleged losses
                    during the Breach Period were not caused by MFM. For this proposition, the
                    Appellants highlighted the fact that, although the restaurant trade had improved
                    by 4.6 per cent in 2004 relative to 2003, Glass House’s performance
                    was worse by 5.76 per cent (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>
                    below for the 2008 statistics published by the Department of Statistics for
                    the restaurant industry in Singapore (“the 2008 Statistics”)).
                    Therefore, Fish &amp; Co had already been underperforming in relation
                    to the industry average before the breaches, and, in fact, performed better
                    during the Breach Period when its percentage of sales improved from
                    -5.76 per cent to -4 per cent. Secondly, they contended that the fact
                    that losses continued to be experienced by Fish &amp; Co after the
                    breaches had ceased indicated the lack of causation, since there had to be
                    causes other than the Appellants’ breaches that were generating those
                    losses. Thirdly, they contended that the Respondent had not proven its losses
                    during the Breach Period. In particular, there was no independent survey or
                    witnesses called by the Respondent to prove its claim for damages. Therefore,
                    they contended that the Respondent had not discharged its burden of
                    proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Respondent, on the other hand, contended that assessment of damages is not
                    an exact science and that the courts adopt a common sense approach. Therefore,
                    there was no need for market surveys and the Judge had correctly inferred that
                    Fish &amp; Co had suffered losses due to the Appellants’
                    breaches based on the factors which she had set out. In so far as the allegation
                    that Fish &amp; Co was already making losses before the Breach Period
                    was concerned, the Respondent contended that the Appellants had misread the
                    statistics, and that, in fact, Fish &amp; Co’s management
                    accounts showed that Glass House was reducing its losses during the Pre-Breach
                    Period by 2.69 per cent annually. Thus, if this upward trend continued,
                    Glass House would have performed with almost no losses by January 2006. However,
                    this was derailed with the opening of MFM in May 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the alternative, the Appellants contended that the Judge had erred in her
                    quantification of damages. The Appellants argued that the AR was correct to use
                    the revised Method A (<em>ie</em>, Method C);
                    that Method B was akin to an account of profits; and that even if
                    Method B was correct, the Judge failed to take into account the fact that,
                    prior to the Breach Period, Fish &amp; Co was already performing below
                    the industry average.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In response to the (alternative) arguments made by the Appellants in the
                    preceding paragraph, the Respondent contended that the Judge had correctly
                    rejected Method C on the basis that the new parameters distorted the
                    calculations; that the Judge correctly applied the percentage of 16 per
                    cent to Method B, which was a loss-based approach and not an account of
                    profits; and that the 2008 Statistics ought not to be admitted into
                    evidence, and, in any event, had been misapplied by the Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2008 Statistics </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In so far as the background to the 2008 Statistics was concerned, the
                    Department of Statistics Press Releases for the months from October 2004 to
                    January 2007 were admitted into evidence before the AR during the assessment of
                    damages hearing. These Monthly Press Releases provided information on the
                    monthly average sales performance of the restaurant industry in Singapore,
                    relative to those during the same month in the year before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Another trade index was published in August 2008, <em>ie</em>, the 2008 Statistics, during the course of the appeals before
                    the High Court which took place over a number of hearings between 15 July
                    2008 and 18 February 2009. This recorded the performance of the restaurant
                    industry in Singapore based on average sales. For the period prior to August
                    2007, the percentages were calculated based on changes in annual sales. On
                    24 February 2009, the Appellants sought to admit this as evidence. The
                    Appellants attempted to rely on it to demonstrate that for the year 2004
                    relative to 2003 (<em>ie</em>, before the breaches),
                    although the restaurant trade had improved by 4.6 per cent, the performance
                    of Glass House was worse (by -5.76 per cent). The Appellants contended that
                    the reason for the late submission of the 2008 Statistics was because the
                    Respondent’s counsel had informed the Judge (during the hearing on
                    19 February 2009) that such statistics were not available. What actually
                    transpired, however, is unclear as it was not recorded in the relevant notes of
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Respondent contended that grave prejudice would be caused to it if the
                    evidence was allowed to be adduced at that late stage. It argued that, as a
                    consequence of the late submission, it did not have the opportunity to respond
                    to it during the trial itself. Further, the Appellants did not file a summons
                    and apply for leave to adduce fresh evidence. Even if they did, the Respondent
                    would have argued that the Appellants had failed to prove that the evidence
                    could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence. The Respondent contended
                    that the onus fell on the Appellants to check if the 2008 Statistics were
                    available if they had wanted to rely on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Judge found that, in order to have an acceptable and meaningful comparison
                    to demonstrate a real decline during the Pre-Breach Period, regard must be given
                    to comparing like periods. However, the Judge felt that this was not possible
                    because Fish &amp; Co’s sales performances were measured in
                    18 month tranches whereas the 2008 Statistics were based on calendar
                    years. The Judge also took on board the Respondent’s objections to the
                    late submission of fresh evidence. She thus disregarded the 2008
                    Statistics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We find that the industry averages provided limited assistance to either
                    party, given the wide disparity in the types of restaurants which were accounted
                    for in these trade statistics. We therefore find that it is not necessary to
                    rely on either the 2008 Statistics or the Monthly Press Releases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue of causation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The difficulty we faced in the present proceedings was establishing the extent
                    to which the Appellants’ breaches caused loss to the Respondent, given the
                    many factors, for example, legitimate competition from
                    Fish &amp; Co’s rivals such as MFM, cannibalisation of sales by
                    other Fish &amp; Co outlets (although this particular factor is
                    somewhat negated by the finding that Glass House served a different market
                    segment from the other Fish &amp; Co outlets), and the quality of food
                    and service – all of which could have affected
                    Fish &amp; Co’s sales apart from the Appellants’ breaches.
                    Further, we agree with the Appellants that, for the purposes of establishing a
                    link between the breaches and the damage, the Appellants’ conduct, the
                    fact that loss of profits was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
                    breaches, as well as the fact that MFM made financial gains were not relevant.
                    As noted earlier, we also did not find it safe to rely on industry-wide
                    statistics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Nevertheless, we accept that MFM’s entrance in the market (which was
                    aided by the Appellants’ breaches) would have caused <em>some</em> loss to Fish &amp; Co. We disagree with the
                    Appellants’ submissions regarding the significance of
                    Fish &amp; Co’s performance during the Pre-Breach Period on the
                    ground that, even if Fish &amp; Co’s performance during the
                    Pre-Breach Period was not optimal, this did not mean that it could not have done
                    better during the Breach Period but for the Appellants’ failure to observe
                    the terms of the Settlement Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Further, given the close proximity between Glass House and the MFM outlet in
                    Plaza Singapura, as well as the similarities between MFM and
                    Fish &amp; Co, it was reasonable that the business attracted by MFM
                    was partly drawn from Fish &amp; Co’s potential clientele.
                    Indeed, before us, counsel for the Appellants accepted that some loss was caused
                    to Fish &amp; Co as a result of the opening of MFM. Although he
                    qualified his opinion by stating that the loss of sales by
                    Fish &amp; Co had nothing to do with the breaches of the Settlement
                    Deed, we find it difficult to distinguish strictly between the Appellants’
                    breaches of the Settlement Deed and MFM’s entrance in the market as a
                    legitimate competitor, given the fact that the former aided the latter. If the
                    Appellants did not think that it stood to gain from the breaches, it would not
                    have infringed the terms of the Settlement Deed in the first place. Clearly, the
                    inference to be made is that the breaches resulted in a financial benefit to the
                    Appellants. Although the fact that the Appellants made financial gains was
                    irrelevant to establishing the issue of causation, in the context of the present
                    proceedings, where there are two similar rivals in the same market, we find that
                    the financial gains made by one could reasonably be translated as losses to the
                    other. In the circumstances therefore, we find that the Respondent had
                    discharged its burden of proving that the breaches of the Settlement Deed
                    resulted in its losses. The more pertinent legal issue, in our view, is the
                    quantum of damages that ought to be awarded to the Respondent – an issue
                    to which our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue of quantification</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Some preliminary observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It should be noted that the present appeals centre on the issue of damages to
                    be awarded in a purely contractual context. No arguments were made in relation
                    to the award of punitive damages or the award of damages pursuant to the
                    principles laid down in the seminal House of Lords decision in <em>Attorney-General v Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd Third Party)</em>
                    [2001] 1 AC 268 (“<em>Blake</em>”).
                    This is perhaps understandable in light of the fact that both these areas of the
                    law of damages are still – to put it mildly – in a state of
                    flux.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The first, in particular, is especially controversial. Although there is an
                    arguable case, in principle, for the award of punitive damages in contract law
                    (see, for example, Ralph Cunnington, “Should punitive damages be part of
                    the judicial arsenal in contract cases?” (2006) 26 Legal Studies 369
                        (“<em>Cunnington</em>”) and Pey-Woan Lee,
                    “Contract Damages, Corrective Justice and Punishment” (2007)
                    70 MLR 887; though <em>cf</em> Solène Rowan,
                    “Reflections on the Introduction of Punitive Damages for Breach of
                    Contract” (2010) 30 OJLS 495), the case law is itself inconclusive
                    (see, for example, Andrew Phang and Pey-Woan Lee, “Restitutionary and
                    Exemplary Damages Revisited” (2003) 19 JCL 1 at
                    pp 21–31 and <em>Cunnington</em> at
                    pp 389-393). This is not surprising in view of the radical as well as
                    draconian nature of punitive damages themselves. The position in Singapore is,
                    not surprisingly, still an open one. In the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>CHS CPO GmbH (in bankruptcy) and another v Vikas Goel and
                        others</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 202, it was observed thus (at
                    [65]–[66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    ... Indeed, the rather limited circumstances under which exemplary
                            damages will be granted under English (and, presumably, Singapore) law
                            appears to be in a state of transition, even flux (compare, for example,
                            the House of Lords decisions of <em>Rookes v Barnard</em>
                            [1964] AC 1129 and <em>Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v
                                Broome</em> [1972] AC 1027 on the one hand with both
                            the House of Lords decision of <em>Kuddus v Chief Constable of
                                Leicestershire Constabulary</em> [2002] 2 AC 122 and
                            the New Zealand Privy Council decision of <em>A v
                                Bottrill</em> [2003] 1 AC 449 on the other; further
                            reference may be made to the English Law Commission's <em>Report
                                on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages</em> (Law
                            Com No 247, 1997)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    There is the yet further issue as to whether or not exemplary damages
                            could be awarded for cynical breaches of contract (see generally, for
                            example, the Canadian Supreme Court decision of <em>Whiten v Pilot
                                Insurance Company</em> (2002) 209 DLR (4th) 257). All
                            these issues raise important questions of great import but fall outside
                            the purview of the present decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The second is less controversial, but no less problematic. Indeed, <em>Blake</em> itself generated – not surprisingly, perhaps
                    – a learned body of legal literature of a magnitude that has been
                    witnessed only occasionally (in this regard, the account by Prof Graham
                    Virgo in his book, <em>The Principles of the Law of
                        Restitution</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2006)
                        (“<em>Virgo</em>”), ch 17 furnishes
                    an exceptionally clear and succinct overview of both the relevant case law as
                    well as legal literature). Put very simply, the principles set out in <em>Blake</em> permit the court to award damages to the plaintiff
                    (in a situation relating to the breach of a contract) on the basis of the gains
                    or profits made by the defendant even though the plaintiff could not otherwise
                    be awarded any damages based on traditional contractual principles (for example,
                    because there has been no difference in value of the contractual subject matter
                    and, hence, no justification for the award of expectation loss). Such damages
                    would, however, be awarded only in <em>exceptional</em>
                    cases. This category of damages has sometimes been termed as
                    “restitutionary damages”, although the House in <em>Blake</em> preferred to classify such an award on the basis of an
                    account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Apart from the various conceptual as well as (as referred to at the end of the
                    preceding paragraph) terminological difficulties, there are (concurrent)
                    practical difficulties as well in so far as the award of damages under the
                    principles set out in <em>Blake</em> are concerned. In
                        <em>Blake</em>, for example, in the leading judgment of
                    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, the statement of principle (at 284–285)
                    does not really furnish concrete guidance as to when the power to award such
                    damages will arise. That the award of such damages is (as already noted in the
                    preceding paragraph) exceptional still leaves the (very practical) issue as to
                        <em>the criteria</em> which will enable the court to
                    ascertain whether or not a given fact situation is indeed exceptional. Case law
                    developments since <em>Blake</em> (see, for example the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Experience Hendrix LLC v
                        PPX Enterprises Inc and another</em> [2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830
                    (noted in Pey-Woan Lee, “Responses to A Breach of Contract”
                    [2003] LMCLQ 301 (“<em>Lee</em>”);
                    Martin Graham, “Restitutionary Damages: The Anvil Struck” (2004)
                    120 LQR 26 (“<em>Graham</em>”); and
                    David Campbell and Philip Wylie, “Ain’t No Telling (Which
                    Circumstances are Exceptional)” (2003) 62 CLJ 605 (“<em>Campbell and Wylie</em>”)) have also suggested a
                        <em>possible alternative</em> approach that is premised
                    not on a restitutionary basis as such but, rather, on a compensatory one
                    (centring on the much discussed decision by Brightman J in the English High
                    Court decision of <em>Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes
                        Ltd and Others</em> [1974] 1 WLR 798 (“<em>Wrotham Park</em>”) (see also
                    Robert J Sharpe and S M Waddams, “Damages for lost
                    opportunity to bargain” (1982) 2 OJLS 290); reference may also be
                    made to the recent Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of
                    Jersey) of <em>Pell Frischmann Engineering Limited v Bow Valley
                        Iran Limited</em> [2010] BLR 73 (especially at [46]–[54])).
                    However, it would appear that the precise contours of this particular head of
                    compensatory loss (as well as its relationship with the established head of
                    expectation loss) have yet to be worked out fully (see, for example, <em>Virgo</em> (at pp 490–492) as well as <em>Lee</em>; <em>Graham</em>; and <em>Campbell and Wylie</em>). It might well be a difference of
                    degree rather than kind, at least in so far as the former consists in an attempt
                    to quantify compensatory damages by reference to the defendant’s gain (see
                        <em>Lee</em> (at pp 302–303) and, by the
                    same author, “A New Model of Contractual Compensation”
                    [2006] LMCLQ 452 at p 453; <em>cf</em> also
                    Samuel Stoljar, “Restitutionary Relief for Breach of Contract”
                    (1989) 2 JCL 1 at pp 3–4). To the extent, of course, that
                    both heads are coincident, the head of damages will, in substance, be based on
                    orthodox principles of the common law of contract (which centre on expectation
                    loss).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was probably the case that, in view of the flux demonstrably present in the
                    alternative approaches briefly summarised above, these approaches were not (as
                    already alluded to above at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>) canvassed
                    by the parties to the present appeals. In the circumstances, we therefore turn,
                    now, to consider the arguments which were in fact canvassed before this court,
                    and which centre on the specific issues relating to both the correct methodology
                    to apply as well as the actual application of that methodology to the facts of
                    the present appeals themselves. We pause to note – parenthetically,
                    however – that the head of compensatory loss mentioned towards the end of
                    the preceding paragraph (centring on <em>Wrotham Park</em>)
                    does bear some affinity to the established head of expectation loss under the
                    law of contract inasmuch as both are compensatory in nature. However, as also
                    noted in the preceding paragraph, the precise contours of the former are still
                    in a state of flux. We also pause to note that even if we proceed on the premise
                    that the quantum of damages to be awarded in the present proceedings is related
                    to a breach of confidence, that breach would, in our view, be founded in an
                    action for breach of <em>contract</em> (see also <em>Virgo</em> (at p 526)). The traditional remedies would
                    take one of two forms, <em>viz</em>, an account of profits
                    or restitutionary damages (see generally <em>Virgo</em> (at
                    pp 527–529)). That having been said, it has also been observed that
                    “[s]ometimes compensatory damages may be awarded for breach of the
                    equitable duty of confidence” (see <em>Virgo</em>
                    (at p 527)). Indeed, the parties proceeded very much – in substance
                    at least – along these (compensatory) lines. This would therefore be an
                    appropriate juncture to turn to the various methodologies concerned (in the
                    context of the award of damages under orthodox principles of the common law of
                    contract). However, before proceeding to do so, we pause to consider briefly a
                    simple – yet fundamental – principle.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It will be apparent that the principal difficulty which we are faced with in
                    the present appeals is the difficulty of quantifying the Respondent’s
                    losses as a result of the Appellants’ breaches. This is because of the
                    numerous factors which could potentially affect the reasons for MFM’s
                    success, or the reasons for Fish &amp; Co’s decline in sales.
                    Given the difficulties in ascertaining with certainty the extent of the
                    Respondent’s losses, this court can, as we observe below, only do the best
                    that we can (based on the relevant evidence before us). In this regard, the
                    following observations in the decision of this court in <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and
                        another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“<em>Robertson Quay</em>”) (at [27]–[28] and [30]–[31])
                    are instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    ... [I]t is fundamental and trite that a plaintiff claiming damages
                            must prove his damage. ... The process of proving damage is an intensely
                            factual one. ... In the circumstances, it is impossible to lay down any
                                <em>general</em> rules or principles as to what
                            constitutes adequate proof of damage since the <em>particular</em> factual circumstances can take, literally, a
                            myriad of forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The law, however, does not demand that the plaintiff prove with
                            complete certainty the exact amount of damage that he has suffered.
                            Thus, the learned author of <em>McGregor on
                                Damages</em> continues as follows (at para 8-002):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here it is clear that some substantial loss has been incurred, the
                            fact that an assessment is difficult because of the nature of the damage
                            is no reason for awarding no damages or merely nominal damages. As
                            Vaughan Williams L.J. put it in <em>Chaplin v
                                Hicks</em> [[1911] 2 KB 786], the leading case on the
                            issue of certainty: “The fact that damages cannot be assessed
                            with certainty does not relieve the wrongdoer of the necessity of paying
                            damages.”
                            <em>Indeed if absolute certainty were required as to the
                                precise amount of loss that the claimant had suffered, no damages
                                would be recovered at all in the great number of cases. This is
                                particularly true since so much of damages claimed are in respect of
                                prospective, and therefore necessarily contingent, loss</em>.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    Accordingly, a court has to adopt a flexible approach with regard to
                            the proof of damage. Different occasions may call for different evidence
                            with regard to certainty of proof, depending on the circumstances of the
                            case and the nature of the damages claimed. … The correct
                            approach that a court should adopt is perhaps best summarised by
                            Devlin J in the English High Court decision of <em>Biggin &amp; Co Ld v Permanite, Ld</em> [1951] 1 KB 422
                                (“<em>Biggin</em>”), where he
                            held (at 438) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to
                            have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    To summarise, a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages
                            without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has
                            suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover
                            damages. On the other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level
                            best to prove its loss <em>and</em> the evidence is
                            cogent, the court should allow it to recover the damages claimed.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     With these principles in mind, we will now proceed to assess the appropriate
                    quantum of damages awardable to the Respondent as a result of the
                    Appellants’ breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Since the finding that Glass House was the only affected
                    Fish &amp; Co outlet was not disputed by the Respondent in the present
                    proceedings, we will not be revisiting that issue; neither will we be revisiting
                    the issue as to whether Method A ought to be utilised as it is clearly
                    inapplicable to the situation that results from this particular finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     We also agree with the Judge that Method C (which, it will be recalled,
                    was a modified version of Method A) ought not to be utilised. In this
                    regard, we accept the Respondent’s expert evidence that the parameters as
                    set out by the AR give rise to illogical results. In particular, the projected
                    revenue of Glass House was below its actual revenue in eight out of the
                    18 months, which is inconsistent with the finding that the breaches of the
                    Settlement Deed caused losses to the Respondent. This suggests that the New
                    Unaffected Restaurants are affected by external factors and therefore cannot be
                    relied upon to project the estimated profits of the Glass House outlet.
                    Therefore, based on the figures derived from Method C, we would not know
                    how Glass House would have performed if the Appellants had not breached the
                    Settlement Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In so far as Method B is concerned, we agree with the Respondent that
                    Method B did not entail a claim for an account of profits. Method B
                    starts with the premise that, had MFM not breached the Settlement Deed, part of
                    MFM’s profits would have gone to Fish &amp; Co. Method B
                    translates MFM’s sales into what Fish &amp; Co would have
                    earned, taking into account its profits and cost structure. Hence, an
                    application of Method B does not purport to transfer MFM’s profits to
                    Fish &amp; Co, but, instead, utilises MFM’s sales to estimate
                    Fish &amp; Co’s loss of profits. This is essentially still a
                    loss-based approach, and does not relate to an account of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Turning to consider Method B itself, unlike Methods A and C,
                    Method B does not involve predicting the Glass House outlet’s sales
                    based on the performance of other Fish &amp; Co outlets, thereby
                    eliminating the problem of external factors affecting the performance of the
                    other Fish &amp; Co outlets. On the other hand, we acknowledge that
                    Method B shares similar difficulties as Methods A and C because it
                    also involves an educated guess as to the impact of other factors affecting the
                    performance of both Fish &amp; Co and MFM, for example, the relative
                    quality of food and services. Further, Method B does not consider to what
                    extent Fish &amp; Co had the capacity to absorb MFM’s sales.
                    Mr Samuel himself was also unable to determine what proportion of
                    MFM’s revenue was attributable to the breaches and simply utilised a range
                    of percentages to calculate a range of loss of profits suffered by
                    Fish &amp; Co (see above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>).
                    Therefore, such factors must be taken into account if Method B is employed
                    in the context of the facts of the present appeals. That having been said, and
                    bearing in mind the fact that damages are not ascertained in an abstract vacuum
                    but must <em>necessarily</em> involve considering many
                    other factors that ought <em>not</em> to be taken into
                    account for the purposes of the assessment of damages but <em>are
                        simultaneously</em> present in the context of the entire factual
                    matrix before the court, <em>some</em> educated guesses
                        <em>have</em> to be made –
                    <em>regardless</em> of the precise methodology ultimately
                    adopted by the court. To state this is merely to acknowledge the very real fact
                    that life is far more complex than simple law school hypotheticals and even
                    textbooks would have us believe. However, that has never prevented the courts
                    from awarding what, in their view, were just and fair sums to plaintiffs if the
                    legal rules and principles justified them. Indeed, as we have acknowledged
                    (realistically) above (at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>), the court
                    will simply do the best that it can, having regard to all the circumstances
                    before it. This is therefore precisely what we will attempt to do in the context
                    of the present proceedings. However (and running slightly ahead of the story),
                    it will be demonstrated that Method B need <em>not</em> be utilised in the context of the present proceedings for
                    reasons which we will now elaborate upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In our view, the logical starting-point is to examine the <em>basic premises</em> upon which the Judge made her award. This is of
                    the first importance simply because a correct set of premises will, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, lead to a just and fair assessment of
                    the damages to be awarded. The contrary (and, we would add, undesirable) result
                    would follow from an incorrect set of premises. Returning to the facts of the
                    present proceedings, it is clear, in our view, that the Judge had regard to the
                    following premises. In particular, she was acutely aware of the fact that, of
                    all the Fish &amp; Co outlets, Glass House was the worst in terms of
                    business performance. However, the Judge was <em>equally</em> aware of the fact that <em>sweeping
                        generalisations had to be eschewed</em>. To this end, she examined
                    closely the <em>particular</em> facts surrounding Glass
                    House’s performance during the material periods (<em>viz</em>, the Post-Breach Period and (especially) the Breach Period).
                    In this regard, the Appellants’ argument that Glass House had been facing
                    a situation of declining gross sales during the latter period, whilst <em>literally</em> correct, was, with respect, rather misleading.
                    What the Judge was concerned with were not the absolute figures as such but,
                    rather, the <em>general trend</em> of these gross sales.
                    Looked at in this light, she must have been of the view (at least implicitly)
                    that <em>Glass House had reversed the general trend</em> of
                    declining gross sales prior to the Breach Period. In particular, we note that
                    the Respondent had submitted evidence of such a reversal during the Pre-Breach
                    Period. Instead, during the period between February 2006 and January 2007 (which
                    constituted much of the (actual) Breach Period itself), Fish &amp; Co
                    had suffered further declines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Having established that Fish &amp; Co had arrested the general trend
                    of declining gross sales, the Judge then proceeded to hold that, in so far as
                    the quantum of positive gross sales which Fish &amp; Co would have
                    made (but for the Appellants’ breaches) were concerned, it was
                    “logical to infer that if the [Appellants] had not committed the breach,
                    [Fish &amp; Co’s] sales would be, <em>at
                        least</em>, in line with <em>the industry’s trend
                        of 12 per cent during the [Breach Period]</em>” [emphasis
                    added] (see the Judgment at [56]). In the circumstances, the Judge held thus
                    (see <em>id</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the Glass House outlet’s monthly sales percentage year on year
                        change at current prices during the breach period is -4%, there is a 16% gap
                        between the former and the industry index. For [Fish &amp; Co] to
                        be in line with the industry, Glass House outlet’s sales would have to
                        increase by 16%. Using the methodology of Method B, loss of profits
                        calculation ought to be based on 16% of MFM’s sales during the period.
                        In my view, the approach adopted is a rational basis for assessing los[t]
                        profits for it will in some way alleviate the speculative element in the
                        exercise. To award a percentage of sales higher than 16% of MFM’s
                        sales would introduce the influence of factors other than the breach that
                        has a bearing on the loss of profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Although there is great attraction, at first blush, in the approach adopted by
                    the Judge (as briefly described above), we are of the view that there are, with
                    the greatest respect, difficulties with the premises upon which that particular
                    approach rested. This is not surprising for, as we shall see, the available
                    evidence on which to base an award of damages in the present proceedings is far
                    from satisfactory. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Judge could only do the best
                    she could. However, after reflecting carefully on the entire evidence as viewed
                    in its context, we are of the view that the inclusion of the industry’s
                    trend of 12 per cent by the Judge could not be justified on the available
                    evidence. In point of fact, on the Respondent’s own evidence as well as
                    statistics, whilst there was a reversal of the general trend of declining gross
                    sales for Glass House, there is no evidence – one way or the other –
                    that demonstrates (on a balance of probabilities) that Glass House would in fact
                    have achieved that level of monthly sales. As noted above, it is axiomatic that
                    any given award of damages must be based on the requisite evidence (which
                    satisfies, <em>inter alia</em>, the elements of causation
                    as well).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We are also of the view that, whilst it is conceptually possible to base an
                    award of (compensatory) damages in contract law on the profits that have been
                    made by the defendant, this should only be done in exceptional situations.
                    Ideally, though, such an award ought to be based on <em>the
                        plaintiff’s own loss</em> rather than (as the Judge did in
                    adopting Method B) by <em>measuring</em> it by
                    reference to <em>the defendant’s gains or
                        profits</em>. The specific issue that arises immediately from this is
                    whether or not there exists sufficient evidence for this court to ascertain
                    – as best as it can –
                    <em>the plaintiff’s own loss</em>. Only in a
                    situation where this was not possible should the court then have recourse to an
                    award of damages by reference to the defendant’s gains or profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Looked at in this light, we are of the view, with respect, that the use of
                    Method B was <em>not</em> necessary as there was, in
                    our view, sufficient evidence that would provide this court with an adequate
                    (and reasoned) basis for ascertaining <em>the plaintiff’s
                        (ie, the Respondent’s) own loss</em>. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Based on the Respondent’s own evidence, Glass House had reversed the
                    general trend of declining gross sales (having regard essentially to three data
                    points, <em>viz</em>, the gross sales for the period
                    between February 2003 and January 2004, the period between February 2004 and
                    January 2005, and the period between February 2005 and January 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>), even prior to the Breach Period. More importantly for the purposes
                    of the present appeals, the Respondent submitted that for the period <em>between February 2006 and January 2007, its predicted or projected
                        percentage change in expected gross sales was -0.38 per

                    statistical perspective, inadequate for predicting a <em>precise</em> trend, given the relative dearth of information but
                    accepting (as the Judge did) the fact that there was an upward trend in so far
                    as the actual gross sales by Glass House were concerned (an increase of
                    2.69 percentage points in the annual rate of change in gross
                        sales<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>), we are prepared to accept this predicted or projected percentage
                    change in expected gross sales (which is nevertheless lower than what the Judge
                    accepted (which included the industry’s trend of 12 per cent)). We
                    pause to emphasise, once again, that this court will attempt the best it can,
                    bearing in mind the fact that the assessment of damages is not (in most
                    instances) a precise scientific exercise (see above at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>). Turning, then, to the period between February 2006 and
                    January 2007, we note that this particular period covers, in fact, much of the
                    Breach Period (two thirds of it, to be precise). The <em>remaining</em> period <em>not</em> covered would
                    comprise the period <em>between August 2005 and January
                        2006</em> (a total of <em>six months</em>).
                    Returning, however, to the period between February 2006 and January 2007, it is
                    clear that – based on a predicted or projected percentage change of
                    -0.38 per cent – the <em>predicted or projected gross
                        sales would have totalled $2,803,911.82</em> (this is based on
                    applying the relevant predicted or projected percentage change (of
                    -0.38 per cent) to the actual gross sales during the <em>preceding period (between February 2005 and January 2006), which totalled
                        $2,814,607.33</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>). Given the fact that the <em>actual</em> gross
                    sales of Glass House for that same period were <em>$2,682,173.27</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> there is <em>a difference (in gross sales) of
                        $121,738.55</em> (<em>ie</em>, $2,803,911.82
                    – $2,682,173.27). However, – and this is a <em>crucial</em> question –
                    <em>what percentage</em> of this difference would have
                    represented <em>Glass House’s profits</em>? In this
                    particular regard, we note that although before us the Appellants challenged the
                    relevance of Method B, they did not challenge Mr Samuel’s
                    calculation that the variable profit margin was 52.38 per cent (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). In our view, it would not be
                    inappropriate to apply this same profit margin to arrive at <em>Glass House’s predicted or projected profits which were lost as a
                        result of the Appellants’ breaches</em>. Applying, therefore, a
                    profit margin of 52.38 per cent to the sum of $121,738.55, this would give
                    a figure of <em>$63,766.65 in so far as Glass House’s loss
                        of profits were concerned during this particular period</em>
                        (<em>viz</em>, between February 2006 and January 2007)
                        (<em>ie</em>, $121,738. 55 ×
                    52.38 per cent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     However, the period between February 2006 and January 2007 does <em>not</em> represent the <em>entire</em>
                    Breach Period. What, then, about Glass House’s predicted or projected loss
                    of profits during the <em>remaining period (between August 2005
                        and January 2006, a total of six months)</em>? It is not unreasonable,
                    in our view, to assume <em>the same rate of profits during this
                        last mentioned period as well</em>. In the circumstances, therefore,
                    the predicted or projected loss of profits between August 2005 and January 2006
                    (a total period of <em>six months</em>) could be estimated
                    to be <em>half</em> of the predicted or projected loss of
                    profits for the period between February 2006 and January 2007 (a total period of
                        <em>twelve months</em>). This would give us a total of
                        <em>$31,883.33</em> (<em>ie</em>,
                    $63,766.65 ÷ 2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     
          <em>To summarise, during the Breach Period, the total loss of
                        predicted or expected profits experienced by Glass House would be
                        $95,649.98</em> (<em>ie</em>, $63,766.65 +
                    $31,883.33). This amount would, in our view, represent <em>the
                        amount of damages the Respondent would be entitled to in respect of the
                        breaches by the Appellants during the Breach Period</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     We turn now to consider the issue of the loss suffered by the Respondent
                    during the <em>Post</em>-Breach Period in general and
                    whether or not such loss was too <em>remote</em> in
                    particular. If, in fact, the loss was not too remote, we would then need to
                    ascertain the requisite <em>quantum</em> of damages to be
                    awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue of remoteness</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on remoteness of damage</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The law relating to remoteness of damage in the law of contract was hitherto
                    unique inasmuch as it had – with a few refinements over the years –
                    remained as it was for approximately 150 years in both England as well as
                    in Singapore. Indeed, such a situation of relative stability is rarely to be
                    found, especially given the nature and development of the common law in general
                    and the law of contract in particular. The principles of remoteness of damage,
                    which find their seminal formulation in the statement of principle by
                    Alderson B in the celebrated English decision of <em>Hadley
                        v Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch 341; 165 ER 145
                        (“<em>Hadley</em>”) (at 354-355 and 151,
                    respectively), were (as just mentioned) refined (albeit without any radical
                    changes) over the next 150 years (see generally the decision of this court
                    in <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at [52]-[61]), which also
                    confirmed the applicability of the principles in <em>Hadley</em> in so far as Singapore is concerned). For the purposes of
                    this judgment, all subsequent references to <em>Hadley</em>
                    (and, in particular, the two limbs set out by Alderson B in that decision)
                    will be taken to include all later refinements as explained in <em>Robertson Quay</em> (see generally <em>id</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Achilleas</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     However, a mere four months after the decision of this court in <em>Robertson Quay</em> was handed down, the House of Lords
                    handed down its decision in <em>Transfield Shipping Inc v
                        Mercator Shipping Inc</em> [2009] 1 AC 61 (“<em>The Achilleas</em>”). As we shall see,
                    Lord Hoffmann introduced, in the latter case, an apparently new legal
                    criterion to the existing law, <em>viz</em>, whether or not
                    the defendant concerned had <em>assumed responsibility</em>
                    for the loss which had occurred as a result of its breach (and see the important
                    essay (to the same effect) by Adam Kramer, “An Agreement-Centred Approach
                    to Remoteness and Contract Damages” in <em>Comparative
                        Remedies for Breach of Contract</em> (Hart Publishing, 2005) (Nili
                    Cohen &amp; Ewan McKendrick eds) ch 12 at p 249
                        (“<em>Kramer</em>”); reference may also
                    be made to the case note on <em>The Achilleas</em> by the
                    same author, “The New Test of Remoteness in Contract” (2009)
                    125 LQR 408 which, not surprisingly perhaps, endorses the approach
                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The
                    Achilleas</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     This is the first occasion that this court has had to consider the approach
                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>,
                    although there have been two learned judgments in the Singapore High Court in
                        <em>Chee Peng Kwan and Another v Toh Swee Hwee Thomas and
                        Others</em> [2009] SGHC 141 (“<em>Chee
                        Peng Kwan</em>”) and <em>Thode Gerd Walter v
                        Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd and others</em> [2010] SGHC 33
                        (“<em>Thode Gerd Walter</em>”), which
                    have, in fact, considered <em>The Achilleas</em>, and which
                    we will have occasion to refer to at appropriate points later in this judgment.
                    Indeed, both these aforementioned judgments noted that this court had not
                    hitherto had the opportunity to consider the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em> (see <em>Chee Peng Kwan</em> (at [35]) and <em>Thode
                        Gerd Walter</em> (at [71])), and it is therefore appropriate, in our
                    view, to consider this approach in the present proceedings to clarify what the
                    legal position is precisely in the Singapore context. Let us turn now to the
                    facts and holdings in <em>The Achilleas</em> itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In <em>The Achilleas</em>, the plaintiff shipowners
                    (“the shipowners”) had chartered their vessel to the defendant
                    charterers (“the charterers”) at a rate of US$16,750 per day.
                    Redelivery of the vessel was scheduled for 2 May 2004. In April 2004, as
                    the market hire rates had risen dramatically, the shipowners fixed a follow-on
                    time charter with another company (“C”) at a rate of US$39,500 per
                    day (with C having the right to cancel the charter if the vessel was not made
                    available by 8 May 2004). As it turned out, the charterer’s final
                    voyage was in fact delayed. By 5 May 2004, the shipowners realised that
                    their vessel would not be returned by 8 May 2004. Unfortunately, the market
                    hire rate at that particular point in time had fallen sharply. In order to
                    persuade C to extend the latest delivery date from 8 May 2004 to
                    11 May 2004, the shipowners had to agree to a reduced rate of hire of
                    $31,500 per day. Significantly, the charterers had not been put on notice of the
                    existence of the shipowners’ follow-on charter with C at any time prior to
                    delivery of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The shipowners claimed damages for breach of contract from the charterers for
                    loss of the difference between the original rate agreed upon between the
                    shipowners and C (of US$39,500 per day) and the reduced rate (of US$31,500 per
                    day) <em>over the period of the follow-on time charter
                        itself</em> (which period comprised 191 days). The total amount
                    of damages claimed, therefore, amounted to US$1,364,584.37.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In contrast, the charterers argued that the shipowners were entitled only to
                    the difference between the market rate and the charter rate for the period
                    during which the latter were deprived of the use of the vessel (which period
                    comprised 9 days). This amounted to only US$158,301.17.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The arbitrators held (by a majority) in favour of the shipowners, finding that
                    the loss fell within the first limb in <em>Hadley</em>.
                    They arrived at this decision <em>notwithstanding</em> the
                    fact that the understanding of <em>the shipping industry or
                        market</em> did <em>not</em> consider such loss
                        (<em>ie</em>, loss based on the difference between the
                    original and reduced rates as argued by the shipowners) to be recoverable, with
                    liability restricted (as the charterers had argued) to the difference between
                    the market rate and the charter rate for the overrun period. The English Court
                    of Appeal affirmed that decision. However, on appeal, the House of Lords held,
                    instead, in favour of the charterers and allowed the appeal. Nonetheless, the
                        <em>specific reasons</em> given by the various law
                    lords differed. It is nevertheless clear that the most significant – and
                    radical – part of the decision lay (as already alluded to above) in the
                    judgment of Lord Hoffmann. The learned law lord was not content with the
                    traditional approach in <em>Hadley</em>. He added (relying
                    on his views in the House of Lords decision of <em>South
                        Australia Asset Management Corporation v York Montague Ltd</em>
                    [1997] AC 191 (“<em>South
                    Australia</em>”), which did not, however, deal directly with the
                    issue of remoteness of damage in contract as such) a <em>new
                        legal criterion</em> based on the concept of <em>assumption of responsibility</em> by the defendant. Put simply, if
                    this additional criterion was not satisfied, the loss concerned would be
                    considered to be too remote and, hence, not recoverable by the plaintiff. In
                    Lord Hoffmann’s words (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me logical to found liability for damages upon the intention
                        of the parties (<em>objectively ascertained</em>)
                        because all contractual liability is <em>voluntarily
                            undertaken</em>. It must be in principle wrong to hold someone
                        liable for risks for which the people entering into such a contract in their
                        particular market, would not <em>reasonably</em> be
                        considered to have undertaken. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Earlier on in his judgment, though, Lord Hoffmann did frame the issue
                    facing him, as follows (at [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The case therefore raises a fundamental point of principle in the law of
                        contractual damages: is the rule that a party may recover losses which were
                        foreseeable (“not unlikely”) <b><em>an external
                            rule of law, imposed upon the parties to every contract in default of
                            express provision to the contrary</em></b>, <b><em>or</em></b><em>is</em><b><em>it a prima facie assumption</em></b><em>about what the parties may be taken to have
                            intended</em>, no doubt <b><em>applicable</em></b><em>in the</em><b><em>great majority</em></b> of cases <b><em>but capable of rebuttal</em></b><em>in cases in which the context, surrounding circumstances
                            or general understanding in the relevant market shows that a party
                            would</em><b><em>not reasonably</em></b><em>have been regarded as</em><b><em>assuming responsibility</em></b><em>for such losses?</em> [emphasis added in italics
                        and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As we shall see below, the above framing of the issue is significant inasmuch
                    as it raises, <em>inter alia</em>, the question as to what
                    constitutes an external rule of law (see below at <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a>) and (perhaps more importantly) whether or not, by
                    phrasing his proposed legal proposition as only “a prima facie
                    assumption”, Lord Hoffmann may well have adopted a “soft
                    version” of his suggested principle which may turn out, in the final
                    analysis, to be no different (in substance, at least) from the traditional rules
                    as embodied in <em>Hadley</em> – a point which we
                    will consider below (at <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     One final point of note may be made with regard to Lord Hoffmann’s
                    judgment. The learned law lord drew an analogy (at [11] and [26]) between his
                    proposed principle of assumption of responsibility with <em>the
                        implication of terms</em> (both of which, in his view, are centred on
                    the <em>interpretation or construction</em> of the contract
                    concerned). This is also an important point which we will deal with in more
                    detail below (at [97]–[100]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The other judgments in <em>The Achilleas</em> are also
                    interesting because, as alluded to above, they demonstrate a variety of other
                    approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Lord Hope of Craighead appears to have endorsed the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann; in his view (at [30]–[31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    ... The critical question however is whether the parties must be
                            assumed to have contracted with each other on the basis that the
                            charterers were <em>assuming responsibility</em>
                            for the consequences of that event. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    
              <em>Assumption of responsibility</em>, which
                                <em>forms the basis</em> of the law of
                            remoteness of damage in contract, is determined by <em>more than</em> what at the time of the contract was
                            reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The learned law lord also observed thus (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the loss was foreseeable – the kind of result that the
                        parties would have had in mind, as the majority arbitrators put it –
                        is <em>not</em> the test. <em>Greater
                            precision is needed than that</em>. The question is whether the
                        loss was a type of loss for which the party can <em>reasonably</em> be assumed to have <em>assumed
                            responsibility</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     
          <em>However</em>, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry adopted
                    a <em>quite different</em> approach. Put simply, the
                    learned law lord endorsed and applied the <em>traditional</em> principles as embodied in <em>Hadley</em> (see especially at [47]–[48] and [52]), and did
                    “not [find] it necessary to explore the issues concerning [<em>South Australia</em>] ... and assumption of responsibility,
                    which ... Lord Hoffmann ... has raised” (see at [63]). In the
                    context of that case, the learned law lord was of the view (at [53]) that
                    “the extent of the relevant rise and fall in the market within a short
                    time was actually <em>unusual</em>” [emphasis added]
                    and that “[t]he owners’ loss stemmed from that <em>unusual occurrence</em>” [emphasis added]. In the
                    circumstances, the loss was, in his view, too remote to fall within the
                        <em>first limb</em> of <em>Hadley</em>. However, Lord Rodger did point out (at [59]) that,
                    if there had been the requisite knowledge pursuant to the <em>second limb</em> of <em>Hadley</em>, the result
                    might well have been different:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he position on damages might also be different, if, for example –
                        when a charterparty was entered into – the owners drew the
                        charterers’ attention to the existence of a forward charter of many
                        months’ duration for which the vessel had to be delivered on a
                        particular date. The charterers would know that a failure to redeliver the
                        vessel in time to allow the owners to deliver it under that charter would be
                        liable to result in the loss of that fixture. Then the <em>second rule or limb</em> in <em>Hadley v Baxendale
                            might well come into play. But the point does not arise in this
                            case</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hindsight is, of course, “twenty-twenty vision”, bearing in mind
                    the requirement that the requisite knowledge under the second limb of <em>Hadley</em> must be communicated <em>at or
                        prior to the formation of the contract</em> itself. However, that
                    means – on a <em>practical</em> level – that,
                    if the parties (in particular, the plaintiff) desire such an eventuality to be
                    covered, then they ought to do so <em>via</em> the
                        <em>express terms</em> of the contract itself (see also
                    below at <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a>). We also note that
                    commentators have expressed the view that Lord Rodger’s approach,
                    whilst taking into account the distinction that has hitherto been drawn by the
                    courts (indeed, in <em>The Achilleas</em> itself) between
                    the type of loss and the extent of loss, ought to have arrived at the <em>opposite</em> result as what was not reasonably contemplated
                    was the <em>extent</em> of the loss and <em>not</em> (as Lord Rodger thought (at [60])) the <em>type</em> of loss (see below at <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe referred to the principles laid down in
                        <em>Hadley</em>. However, it is not altogether clear
                    whether the learned law lord based his decision (to allow the appeal, as did the
                    rest of the House) on these principles <em>only or
                        also</em> on Lord Hoffmann’s principle of assumption of
                    responsibility. Indeed, Lord Walker concluded his judgment (with respect,
                    somewhat <em>ambiguously</em>) thus (at [87]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For these reasons, <em>and for the further reasons given by
                            my noble and learned friends, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of
                            Craighead</em> and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, whose opinions
                        I have had the advantage of reading in draft, I would allow this appeal.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Finally, Baroness Hale of Richmond preferred to base her decision on the
                    (traditional) principles laid down in <em>Hadley</em>.
                    Indeed, in her view (at [90]), “[n]o one has suggested that it was at all
                    unusual or unlikely for the owners to commit their ship to a new fixture to
                    begin as soon as possible after the ship was free from the first” and
                    that “[i]t was conceded before the arbitrators that missing dates for a
                    subsequent fixture was a “not unlikely” result of late
                    redelivery”; indeed, “[b]oth parties would have been well aware of
                    that at the time when the contract was made” and that “[t]hey
                    would also have been well aware that a new charter was likely to commit that
                    particular ship rather than to allow the ship-owner to go into the market and
                    find a substitute to fulfil his next commitment if his ship was late
                    back”. Baroness Hale then proceeded to observe thus (see <em>id</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Above all, if the parties wish to exclude liability for consequential loss
                        of this kind then it will be very simple to insert such a clause into future
                        charterparties. ... To rule out a whole class of loss, simply because the
                        parties had not previously thought about it, risks as much uncertainty and
                        injustice as letting it in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In light of the views expressed in the preceding paragraph, the decision by
                    Baroness Hale to allow the appeal as she did must have been taken with no small
                    measure of reluctance. What <em>is</em> clear is that she
                    thought (at [93]) that the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann added
                    “an interesting <em>but novel</em> dimension to the
                    way in which the question of remoteness of damage in contract is to be answered,
                    a dimension <em>which does not clearly emerge from the classic
                        authorities</em>” [emphasis added]. Baroness Hale was clearly
                    not in favour of it and premised her decision (like Lord Rodger) on the
                    more traditional approach; in her words, in so far as the principle of
                    assumption of responsibility was concerned, it depended on a wider range of
                    factors and value judgments and could thus introduce much room for argument in
                    other contractual contexts (see <em>id</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an examination, this might well make the difference between a
                        congratulatory and an ordinary first class answer to the question. But
                        despite the excellence of counsels’ arguments it was not explored
                        before us, although it is explored in academic textbooks and other writings,
                        including those cited by Lord Hoffmann in para 11 of his opinion.
                        I note, however, that the most recent of these, Professor Robertson’s
                        article on “The basis of the remoteness rule in contract”
                        (2008) 28 Legal Studies 172 argues strongly to the contrary. <em>I am not immediately attracted to the idea of introducing into
                            the law of contract the concept of the scope of duty which has perforce
                            had to be developed in the law of negligence</em>. The rule in
                            <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> asks what the parties
                        must be taken to have had in their contemplation, rather than what they
                        actually had in their contemplation, but the criterion by which this is
                        judged is a factual one. <em>Questions of assumption of risk
                            depend upon a wider range of factors and value judgments</em>.
                        This type of reasoning is, as Lord Steyn put it in <em>Aneco Reinsurance Underwriting Ltd v Johnson &amp; Higgins
                            Ltd</em> [2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 157, 186, a
                        “deus ex machina”. <em>Although its result in
                            this case may be to bring about certainty and clarity in this particular
                            market, such an imposed limit on liability could easily be at the
                            expense of justice in some future case. It could also introduce much
                            room for argument in other contractual contexts. Therefore, if this
                            appeal is to be allowed, as to which I continue to have doubts, I would
                            prefer it to be allowed on the narrower ground identified by Lord
                            Rodger, leaving the wider ground to be fully explored in another case
                            and another context</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     So much by way of a summary of the various judgments in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> itself. We turn now to the very important issue as to
                    whether or not the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in that case ought
                    to be adopted in the <em>Singapore</em> context.</p>

                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>
                    ought to be followed and that its appearance after <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> therefore has no effect on the latter decision. Put simply,
                    the two limbs set out in <em>Hadley</em> (as elaborated
                    upon and explained in <em>Robertson Quay</em> itself)
                    continue to be the governing principles in relation to the doctrine of
                    remoteness of damage in contract law in the Singapore context. There are a
                    number of reasons for adopting this position which we now proceed to elaborate

                    Achilleas</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     First, and from the most basic perspective, the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann was – arguably, at least -<em>not</em> adopted (either unanimously or by a majority)
                    by the House <em>and</em> hence did not constitute the
                        <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the case itself (and see
                    Harvey McGregor QC, in his leading textbook, <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>McGregor</em>”) at para 6-173,
                    who also cites Lord Walker’s view in the (<em>subsequent</em>) Privy Council decision (on appeal from the Court of
                    Appeal of Bahamas) of <em>Sentinel International Ltd v
                        Cordes</em> [2008] UKPC 60, where the learned law lord observed (at
                    [50]) that “a contractual claim for damages for loss of a bargain is
                        <em>not</em> of course subject to the …
                    principle [in <em>South Australia</em>]” [emphasis
                    added]). This last-mentioned point is significant because it is, on one reading
                    at least, unclear whether Lord Walker was, in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>, adopting Lord Hoffmann’s approach or the
                    more traditional approach as embodied in the principles in <em>Hadley</em> itself (see also above at [85] as well as <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at [70])). That having been said, the
                    precise effect of Lord Walker’s (with respect) ambiguous statements
                    in <em>The Achilleas</em> on the precise <em>ratio decidendi</em> in that particular case remain controversial,
                    with some commentators being of the (contrary) view that, on balance, those
                    statements are in line with Lord Hoffmann’s approach (see, for
                    example, Paul C K Wee, “Contractual interpretation and
                    remoteness” [2010] LMCLQ 150 (“<em>Wee</em>”) at pp 156-157, which, in our view, is one of
                    the more perceptive of the (not surprisingly) many articles analysing <em>The Achilleas</em>). Indeed, the only clear proposition that
                    can be proffered in this particular regard is that there is probably <em>no clear ratio decidendi</em> as such that can be deduced
                    from a perusal of the written judgments handed down by the various law lords in
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> (see also generally Greg Gordon,
                        “<em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> Revisited:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In a related vein, it is also worth pointing to the fact that there is some
                    (weighty) authority to the <em>contrary</em> in an earlier
                    (and leading) House of Lords decision of <em>Koufos v C Czarnikow

                    (“AR Teo”) in <em>Chee Peng Kwan</em>
                    (at [36]) as well as by AR Peh Aik Hin (“AR Peh”) in
                        <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at [70]); reference may
                    also be made to the observation of Rix LJ at the Court of Appeal stage of
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> (see <em>Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc (The

                    However, leaving aside for the moment issues centring on what the precise
                        <em>ratio decidendi</em> in <em>The

                    prior (especially House of Lords) authority to the contrary), let us consider
                    the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The view preferred here is that the agreement-centred approach as accepted
                        in <em>The Achilleas</em> is best understood not as an
                        approach to remoteness, but as embodying an approach to interpretation.
                        Remoteness is traditionally regarded as a doctrine which limits and cuts
                        back <em>prima facie</em> liability. However, under the
                        agreement-centred approach, <em>prima facie</em>
                        liability is never cut back. If limits on the scope of contractual duties
                        can be distilled through the ordinary process of interpretation, as
                        Lord Hoffmann contends ... , then the claimant is always “to be
                        placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract
                        had been performed”, where the meaning of “the
                        contract” is properly construed. There are no limits on the
                        fulfilment of the claimant’s (properly construed) expectation
                        interest. Consequently, under the agreement-centred approach, there is no
                        independent role for remoteness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Put simply, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann is not only
                    conceptually distinct from – but also appears to exclude the operation of
                    – the very doctrine of remoteness of damage in contract law itself. In
                    this regard, the observation made in the preceding paragraph is a perceptive
                    one, although, as we will point out below (at [101]-[107]), it might in fact be
                    possible to achieve a <em>balance</em> between both
                    approaches inasmuch as the concept of assumption of responsibility by the
                    defendant (which is the basis of Lord Hoffmann’s approach) might be
                    considered as <em>having already been embodied or incorporated
                        within the existing doctrine of remoteness of damage in contract law (which,
                        of course, comprises, in essence, the two limbs in</em>
                        Hadley<em>)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   Uncertainty in application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann is also, with respect,
                    unconvincing when viewed from a <em>practical</em>
                    perspective. As was perceptively (as well as succinctly) observed in <em>McGregor</em> (at para 6-171):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope propose is full of difficulty,
                        uncertainty and impracticality. How are we to tell what subjectively the
                        contracting parties were thinking about assumption of responsibility? When
                        contracting, assumption of responsibility was probably not in their minds at
                        all, for it is well known that parties entering a contract are thinking of
                        its performance rather than of its breach. Apart from this uncertainty there
                        is the impracticality of allowing defendants to raise the issue, as they
                        will surely do, in case after case as an extra argument, thereby taking up
                        the time of the courts unnecessarily and making the arriving at settlements
                        more difficult.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Prof Andrew Robertson also points, pertinently in our view, to the fact
                    that “typically there is no factual basis for judging the intentions of
                    the parties” (see Andrew Robertson, “The basis of the remoteness
                    rule in contract” (2008) 28 Legal Studies 172 (“<em>Robertson</em>”) at p 185; reference may also be
                    made to Edwin Peel, “Remoteness Revisited” (2009)
                    125 LQR 6 (“<em>Peel</em>”) at
                    p 11 and <em>Bridge</em> at pp 761–762)
                    – a point which was also emphasised (in a judicial context) in <em>Chee Peng Kwan</em> (at [36]). Indeed, in another perceptive
                    observation, Steve McAuley observed thus (see “Transfield Shipping Inc v
                    Mercator Shipping Inc” (2010) 38 ABLR 65 (“<em>McAuley</em>”) at p 66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While, in the <em>Transfield</em> decision, Lords
                        Hoffman[n] and Hope seemingly applied the “assumed responsibility
                        test” with relative ease in finding that the charterers did not
                        assume responsibility for the owners’ loss relating to the new
                        charter, the reasons given as to why the charterers did not assume
                        responsibility are <em>somewhat arbitrary</em>. In this
                        regard, Lord Hoffman[n] cites, first, the
                        “unquantifiable” nature of the loss claimed and, secondly, the
                        capacity of the owners to decide whether or not to enter into a new charter
                        prior to the vessel being returned. Both reasons given by
                        Lord Hoffman[n] do <em>not</em> involve a detailed
                        examination of the parties’ assumed responsibilities at the time of
                        entering the contract, <em>but instead involve a degree of
                            arbitrariness on the part of the fact-finder in determining what were
                            the assumed responsibilities of the parties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is not to say that the decision in <em>Transfield</em> was the wrong decision. What is being argued is
                        that <em>the “assumed responsibility test”
                            could be a mechanism used by the courts to achieve what the courts
                            consider a just outcome, rather than requiring the courts to engage in
                            an analysis of what types of losses the parties actually assumed
                            responsibility for</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Indeed, in so far as Lord Hoffmann’s reason centring on the
                    unquantifiable nature of the loss claimed is concerned, a learned author
                    pertinently observes (see <em>Wee</em> at p 165),
                    “the courts have never before denied recovery for losses on the basis
                    that they are unquantifiable or unpredictable” and that “[o]n the
                    contrary, unpredictability or unquantifiability has repeatedly been no bar to
                    recovery whatsoever”. In point of fact, the very nature of the concept of
                    damages itself is premised on the fact that the monetary loss is, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, unliquidated to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Returning to the passage quoted from <em>McGregor</em>
                    (above at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>), as that particular passage
                    pithily emphasises, the “assumption of responsibility” (<em>ie</em>, Lord Hoffmann’s phraseology in <em>The Achilleas</em>) is <em>not</em>
                    something which the parties have, <em>ex hypothesi</em>,
                    had the opportunity to think about, let alone discuss at the time they entered
                    into the contract (see also <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at
                    [68])). Hence, Lord Hoffmann’s analogy (in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>) to the doctrine of <em>the implied
                        term</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>) is
                    – looked at in this particular light – not inapposite. However, it
                    should be emphasised that the doctrine of the implied term is itself one of
                        <em>last resort</em>. As was aptly and pithily observed
                    by the late R E Megarry, an implied term is “so often the last
                    desperate resort of counsel in distress” (see R E Megarry,
                        <em>Miscellany-at-Law</em>
                    (Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 1955) at p 210; and cited by this
                    court in <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers
                        Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at [8]). Herein, in fact, lies the difficulty with
                    the adoption of the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>: The formulation of legal rules and
                    principles governing remoteness of damage in contract law is (as we elaborate
                    upon below at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>) intended to furnish
                    lawyers, courts and students alike with <em>general
                        guidance</em>. Put simply, these rules and principles are <em>not</em> intended as mere ad hoc, gap-filling
                    measures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is interesting to note, at this juncture, that the broad underlying thread
                    of <em>interpretation</em> which Lord Hoffmann
                    utilises in advocating his approach centring on assumption of responsibility by
                    the defendant (a point perceptively made by <em>Wee</em>
                    (above at <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a>)) has <em>also</em> been utilised by the learned law lord in the area of
                    implied terms as well (in particular, to terms implied <em>in
                        fact</em>) – hence, the analogy drawn by Lord Hoffmann
                    between both these aforementioned areas. However, and with the greatest of
                    respect, the uncertainty generated in the latter area would, in our view, apply
                    equally to the former area. In the recent Privy Council decision (on appeal from
                    the Court of Appeal of Belize) of <em>Attorney General of Belize
                        and others v Belize Telecom Limited and another</em> [2009]
                    1 WLR 1988, for example, Lord Hoffmann, delivering the judgment
                    of the Board, adopted an extremely broad approach towards the implication of
                    terms in fact, effectively <em>effacing</em> the
                    distinction between the time-honoured “business efficacy” and
                    “officious bystander” tests (for a general account of these two
                    tests (as well as their possible relationship), see the Singapore High Court
                    decision of <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v
                        Modern-Pak Private Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 at
                    [29]-[40]). This results, however, in a lack of concrete rules (and consequent
                    normative guidance) as well as uncertainty in the practical sphere (a point
                    which is also emphasised by <em>Wee</em> at
                    pp 162-166; reference may also be made to Elizabeth Macdonald,
                    “Casting Aside ‘Officious Bystanders’ and ‘Business
                    Efficacy’?” (2009) 26 JCL 97). One should not, in fact,
                    be surprised at such a result as the lack of guidance as well as uncertainty is
                    likely to be the result when the <em>umbrella</em> concept
                    of <em>interpretation</em>, which is pitched at a <em>necessarily high level of abstraction</em>, is utilised (in
                    substance, if not form) as the legal basis for <em>different and
                        disparate areas of law</em> (<em>cf</em> also the
                    collected essays in Brian Coote, <em>Contract as Assumption
                        – Essays on a Theme</em> (Hart Publishing, 2010) (Rick Bigwood
                    ed); in so far as <em>The Achilleas</em> itself is
                    concerned, see the very recent comment by Brian Coote, “Contract as
                    Assumption and Remoteness of Damage” (2010) 26 JCL 211
                        (“<em>Coote</em>”)). The lack of guidance
                    stems from the absence of a sufficiently specific set of <em>concrete</em> rules and principles whilst the resultant uncertainty
                    is the natural consequence when legal rules and principles lacking specific and
                    concrete guidance are sought to be applied to the various sets of facts (which
                    are themselves necessarily myriad in nature) (in this regard, see also generally
                    this court’s observations in <em>Mühlbauer AG v
                        Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 724 (“<em>Mühlbauer</em>”)
                    (at [40]-[43]) about the danger of over-generalisation and over-abstraction in
                    making legal arguments). Put simply, whilst it is desirable from a conceptual
                    perspective to have umbrella doctrines that make for <em>theoretical</em> “neatness”, there is a limit to which
                    one can have “one-size-fits-all”
                    <em>doctrines</em> that will not ultimately become legal
                    procrustean beds (see also <em>Wee</em> at pp 166 and
                    175-176). Indeed, the necessity for <em>specific</em> rules
                    and principles has always been the hallmark of the development of the common
                    law. Such specificity has, in fact, been (perhaps paradoxically) one of the key
                    strengths of the common law itself, which is why Prof S F C
                    Milsom perceptively observed that the common law system developed in a
                    strikingly systematic fashion, notwithstanding the apparent absence of a clear
                    blueprint as such (see generally S F C Milsom, “Reason in
                    the Development of the Common Law” (1965) 81 LQR 496; see also
                        <em>Mühlbauer</em> (at [42]) where it is observed that
                    there is an <em>interactive</em> process between the
                        <em>universal</em> and the <em>particular</em> or the <em>general</em> and the
                        <em>specific</em> in law and decision-making).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Whilst on the topic of implied terms, there is some commentary on <em>The Achilleas</em> which suggests that the approach advocated
                    by Lord Hoffmann in that decision is actually based, instead, on the
                    concept of terms implied <em>in law</em> rather than terms
                    implied in fact (see, for example, John Halladay, “Remoteness of
                    Contractual Damages” (2009) 21 Denning LJ 173 at p 178). This
                    does not, however, appear to be the tenor of Lord Hoffmann’s judgment
                    in <em>The Achilleas</em> (which appears, instead, to adopt
                    the analogy of terms implied in <em>fact</em> (see
                        <em>Peel</em> at p 11)). However, even assuming
                    that it is, this would merely serve to underscore the weakness in the analogy
                    itself. In particular, as this court has pointed out in <em>Jet
                        Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and
                        other appeals</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (at
                    [90]-[91]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">90    The category of “terms implied in law” is not without
                            its disadvantages. A certain measure of uncertainty will always be an
                            integral part of the judicial process and, hence, of the law itself.
                            This is inevitable because of the very nature of life itself, which is
                            – often to a very large extent – unpredictable. Such
                            unpredictability and consequent uncertainty is of course a double-edged
                            sword. It engenders both the wonder and awe as well as the dangers and
                            pitfalls in life. Given this reality, however, one of the key functions
                            of the courts is not to add unnecessarily to the uncertainty that
                            already exists. Looked at in this light, the category of “terms
                            implied in law” does tend to generate some uncertainty –
                            not least because of the broadness of the criteria utilised to imply
                            such terms, which are grounded (in the final analysis) on reasons of
                            public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    However, the category of “terms implied in law” has now
                            been firmly woven into the tapestry of our local contract law. It also
                            aids, on occasion at least, in achieving a just and fair result. Most
                            importantly, perhaps, it has formed both the theoretical as well as
                            practical basis for <em>statutory</em> implied
                            terms, such as those found in the UK Sale of Goods Act 1979 (c 54)
                            (applicable in Singapore <em>via</em> the
                            application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed) and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As the issue of implied terms is only indirectly before us, we do not wish to
                    make any further observations, save to note that (in addition to the
                    difficulties arising from utilising an analogy with terms implied in fact as
                    noted above) treating the analogy utilised by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em> as one referring to terms implied in law
                    (as opposed to terms implied in fact) does not meet the problems of a lack of
                    guidance as well as the generation of uncertainty and may, on one view at least,
                    in fact exacerbate them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The merits of the existing approach in <em>Hadley</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Existing approach already embodies and encompasses the
                concept of assumption of responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    More importantly, even if we accept Lord Hoffmann’s premise that
                    the focus ought to be on the agreement between the parties, any solution
                        (<em>as in the case of implied terms</em>) will
                        <em>necessarily</em> be one that is <em>imposed by the court</em> (albeit based on the objective evidence).
                    Looked at in <em>this</em> light, it is our view that,
                        <em>even if</em> (again) we accept
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>, <em>both the limbs</em> in
                        <em>Hadley</em> would <em>necessarily
                        embody and encompass the necessary criteria for ascertaining (on an
                        objective basis) whether or not there had been an assumption of
                        responsibility or an implied undertaking on the part of the
                        defendant</em> (a similar point was also perceptively made by a
                    learned author in his commentary on <em>Robertson Quay</em>
                    (see Goh Yihan, “<em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v
                        Steen Consultants Pte Ltd</em>” (2009) 9 OUCLJ 101
                        (“<em>Goh</em>”) at p 107), though
                    the author did not appear to go so far as to suggest that Lord Hoffmann’s
                    assumption of responsibility could be <em>subsumed</em>
                    under the two limbs in <em>Hadley</em>)<em>.
                        If so, then, with the greatest of respect, Lord Hoffmann has not really
                        added anything new to the existing law, which continues to operate based on
                        the legal rules and principles laid down in the seminal decision
                        of</em> Hadley. Let us elaborate upon as well as explain the
                    proposition just made by considering <em>both</em> of the
                    limbs in <em>Hadley seriatim</em>. However, before
                    proceeding to do so, it is interesting to note that at least one commentator has
                    characterised a part of Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in <em>The Achilleas</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a>) as adopting what he terms “a “soft”
                    version” of the agreement-centred approach” (see <em>Wee</em> at p 168). We agree with him, however, that
                    (see <em>Wee</em> at pp 168-169):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [t]he soft version of the agreement-centred approach is ... <em>identical in substance and theory</em> to the traditional
                        approach to remoteness [in <em>Hadley</em>], though
                        dressed up in different terminology: where the contract would be understood
                        by a reasonable person in all the circumstances not to contain any terms,
                        express or implied, limiting recovery for breach, recoverable losses are
                        those which are foreseeable as a not unlikely consequence of breach.

                the concept of assumption of responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Turning, then, to the <em>first limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>, this court had described it (<em>together with</em> the <em>second limb</em>) in
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em>, as follows (at [55] and
                    [59]–[60]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    Turning to the <em>Singapore</em> context, there is no
                            doubt that the rule in <em>Hadley</em>, as restated by
                            Asquith LJ in Victoria Laundry (as set out in the preceding
                            paragraph), represents the law in relation to remoteness of damage in
                            contract. In the Singapore High Court decision of <em>CHS CPO GmbH
                                v Vikas Goel</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 202 (<em>“CHS CPO GmbH”</em>), for example, a summary of
                            the law in this particular area was furnished, as follows (at
                            [81]–[83] and [85]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b><em>It is established law that remoteness of damage
                                under contract law comprises two limbs</em></b> - first, damage
                            flowing “naturally” from the breach of contract and,
                            secondly, “unusual” damage which (by its very definition)
                            does not flow naturally from the breach of contract but, rather, is due
                            to special circumstances. <b><em>These two limbs are in
                                fact to be found in the seminal decision of the (English) Court of
                                Exchequer in</em></b><b><em>Hadley</em></b><b><em>... as helpfully elaborated upon in the English
                                Court of Appeal decision of Victoria Laundry .</em></b>.. Indeed,
                            in the latter decision, Asquith LJ (who delivered the judgment of the
                            court) perceptively and helpfully distinguished between two kinds of
                            knowledge that must be brought home to the defendant in order that the
                            damage might not be considered to be too remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The first is <em>imputed</em> knowledge. Knowledge is
                            imputed when it is the kind or type of knowledge that everyone, as
                            reasonable people, must be taken to know. Everyone must, as reasonable
                            people, be taken to know of damage which flows “naturally”
                            from a breach of contract. In other words, this category of (imputed)
                            knowledge is linked to the <em>first</em> limb referred to
                            in [81] above. What is of vital legal significance is that in so far as
                            such “natural” or “ordinary” damage is
                            concerned, there is no need for the plaintiff to prove actual knowledge
                            on the part of the defendant: the defendant (in this particular case,
                            the plaintiffs) must be <em>taken to know</em> (under the
                            concept of imputed knowledge) that such damage would <em>ordinarily</em> ensue as a result of the breach of contract
                            concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The second type of knowledge is <em>actual</em> knowledge.
                            Not surprisingly, this particular category of knowledge relates to the
                                <em>second limb</em> referred to in [81] above. It
                            concerns “special” or “non-natural” damage
                            that results from a breach of contract. A relatively more stringent
                            criterion of knowledge is here required in order that the damage will
                            not be found to be too remote in law. Put simply, the defendant must
                            have had <em>actual</em> knowledge of the special
                            circumstances which are outside the usual course of things. These
                            circumstances must be such that, in the event of a breach of contract
                            occurring, loss or damage going <em>beyond</em> what would
                            ordinarily result under the first limb (referred to in [81], above, and
                            which, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, [is] within the usual course
                            of things) would ensue. In fairness to the defendant, in order for him
                            or her to be fixed with liability for such “special” or
                            “non-natural” damage, he or she must have had actual
                            knowledge of the aforementioned special circumstances. In order for such
                                <em>actual</em> knowledge to be brought home, as it
                            were, to the defendant, an objective test is utilised. ...</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">That the abovementioned principles are part of Singapore law can be
                            seen, for example, from a local decision decided as far back as 1880:
                            see <em>Yeo Leng Tow &amp; Co v Rautenberg, Schmidt &amp;
                                Co</em> (1880) 1 Ky 491. There are of course more recent
                            decisions, including the Singapore Court of Appeal decisions of
                                <em>Hong Fok Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte
                                Ltd</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 and <em>City
                                Securities Pte Ltd v Associated Management Services Pte
                                Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 410.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above statement of principle was, in fact, endorsed by this court in
                            <em>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte
                            Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769, where it was held (at
                        [106]) that “the Singapore High Court decision of <em>CHS CPO GmbH ..</em>. reaffirms the fact that the principles
                        established in <em>Hadley</em> ... continue to be the
                        law in the Singapore context.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59    We wish to add here that the criterion of “reasonable
                            contemplation” applies to both limbs of the rule in <em>Hadley</em>, although a difference exists between its
                            application with respect to each of the two limbs. For the first limb of
                            Hadley, the horizon of contemplation is confined to loss which arises
                            naturally in the usual course of things and which is therefore presumed
                            to have been within the contemplation of the parties. For the second
                            limb of the rule in <em>Hadley</em> (“the second limb
                            of <em>Hadley</em>”), by reason of the special
                            knowledge possessed by the party who breaches the contract (“the
                            contract-breaker”), the horizon of contemplation is extended to
                            loss that does not arise in the usual course of things (see <em>The Heron II</em> at 415-416). We pause to observe,
                            parenthetically, at this juncture, that there might, on occasion at
                            least, be some haziness between these two limbs - a point which,
                            however, does not arise for analysis or decision in the present appeal
                            (for a discussion of this particular point, see the recent House of
                            Lords decision of <em>Sempra Metals Ltd v Inland Revenue
                                Commissioners</em> [2007] 3 WLR 354 (<em>“Sempra Metals”</em>) at [215] (per
                            Lord Mance) as well as the (also) House of Lords decision of
                                <em>Jackson v Royal Bank of Scotland plc</em> [2005]

                            [46]-[49] (<em>per</em> Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe)).
                            In relation to this point, there have also been some cases that have
                            commented that the rule in <em>Hadley</em> should be treated
                            as a composite whole and viewed as stating a single principle (see, for
                            instance, per Christopher Clarke J in <em>The
                                Achilleas</em> [2007] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 19 at [49]
                            (whose decision was affirmed, but without any apparent discussion of
                            this particular issue, by the English Court of Appeal (see [2007]
                            2 Lloyd’s Rep 555)), as well as per Robert Goff J
                            in <em>The Pegase</em> [1981] 1 Lloyd’s
                            Rep 175 at 182). These cases, however, recognise that the
                            application of the rule in <em>Hadley depends</em> on the
                                <em>degree of knowledge</em> held by the
                            contract-breaker at the time of the contract (see <em>The
                                Achilleas</em> at [51] and <em>The Pegase</em> at
                            182). In the circumstances, it is clear, in our view, that these cases
                            are not suggesting, in any way, anything that is different, in <em>substance</em>, from our interpretation of the rule in
                                <em>Hadley</em> (as set out at [55] above). On a
                            separate note, there is also the possible ramification of distinguishing
                            between the type and the extent of loss arising from a breach of
                            contract (see, in this regard, the perceptive case note by
                            Demetrios H Hadjihambis, “Remoteness of Damage in
                            Contract” (1978) 41 MLR 483 at 484-485, commenting on
                            one of several issues raised by the somewhat controversial English Court

                                Ingham &amp; Co Ltd</em> [1978] QB 791, where
                            Lord Denning MR also sought to apply the tortious rules on
                            remoteness to a contractual claim for physical injury or damage (see
                            also the Ontario Court of Appeal decision of <em>Kienzle v
                                Stringer</em> (1981) 130 DLR (3d) 272 at 276 (per
                            Zuber JA) as well as the English Court of Appeal decision of

                            598)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    What is significant, however, is that the rule in <em>Hadley</em> continues to be endorsed (in, inter alia,

                                Jackson</em>) as good law. We also wish to state that we do
                            not see the point in embarking on an exegesis of the precise degree of
                            probability required to satisfy the threshold of “reasonable
                            contemplation” as to do so would be to engage in the
                            “semantic hairsplitting” referred to in <em>Tang Kin

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The phrases and words of <em>Hadley v. Baxendale</em> have
                            been hallowed by long [use] and gain little advantage from the
                            paraphrases or substitutes. The ideas and factors conveyed by the words
                            are clear enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It is therefore clear – and this <em>also</em>
                    appears to be the view taken pursuant to the integrated approach (which is
                    discussed below (at <a href="#p1_121">[121]</a>–<a href="#p1_125">[125]</a>)) – that the <em>first
                        limb</em> in <em>Hadley necessarily embodies an implied
                        undertaking or assumption of responsibility</em> on the part of the
                    defendant (albeit on an <em>imputed</em> basis). This
                        <em>imputation</em> is <em>justified</em> on the ground that, in so far as <em>natural or ordinary</em> loss is concerned, any reasonable person in
                    the shoes of the defendant should (with the (<em>imputed</em>) knowledge that such loss would ensue) be <em>taken to have assumed responsibility for such loss should it breach
                        the contract concerned</em>. Hence, even if we adopt
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>, the reasoning just referred to would provide the court
                    with <em>an objective basis</em> for finding that the
                    defendant had (in the absence of an express undertaking to the contrary)
                        <em>assumed responsibility</em> for the (<em>natural or ordinary</em>) loss which has occurred. <em>Put simply, even if we accept Lord Hoffmann’s approach,
                        it is, in fact, already an intrinsic part of the first limb in</em>
                    Hadley.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The second limb of <em>Hadley</em> and
                the concept of assumption of responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Turning now to the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>, this court had, in fact, described it in
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em> in the passages already quoted
                    above (at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It is clear that it will be the case that Lord Hoffmann’s approach
                    in <em>The Achilleas</em> will be an <em>additional</em> element with respect to the <em>second
                        limb</em> in <em>Hadley only if</em> the
                        <em>actual</em> knowledge of the defendant under this
                    particular limb of <em>Hadley</em> is thought to be
                        <em>insufficient</em> from a legal point of view
                    – in so far as the establishment of an implied obligation or an assumption
                    of responsibility on the part of the defendant is concerned. There is, in fact,
                    some (older) authority (stretching back <em>almost five
                        decades</em>) to the effect that the <em>second</em> limb in <em>Hadley is</em> based on
                        <em>an implied undertaking</em> on the part of the
                    defendant to the plaintiff that it would bear the (enhanced) loss. This is to be
                    found in the judgment of Diplock LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision
                    of <em>Robophone Facilities Ltd v Blank</em> [1966]
                    1 WLR 1428 (“<em>Robophone
                    Facilities</em>”) at 1448. However, the learned judge did observe
                    that the defendant’s “actual knowledge of the special circumstances
                    is relevant as <em>one</em> of the factors from which [its]
                    undertaking can be implied” [emphasis in original] (<em>id</em>). Diplock LJ then proceeded to observe thus (<em>id</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second factor is also necessary, <em>viz</em>.,
                        that he should have acquired this knowledge from the plaintiff, or at least
                        that [it] should know that the plaintiff knew that [it] was possessed of it
                        at the time the contract was entered into and so could reasonably foresee at
                        that time that an enhanced loss was liable to result from a breach. Where
                        both these factors are present, the defendant’s conduct in entering
                        into the contract without disclaiming liability for the enhanced loss which
                        he can foresee <em>gives rise to the implication that he
                            undertakes to bear it. But such an undertaking need not be left to
                            implication; it can be express</em>. If the contract contained an
                        express undertaking by the defendant to be responsible for all actual loss
                        to the plaintiff occasioned by the defendant’s breach, whatever that
                        loss might turn out to be, it would not affect the defendant’s
                        liability for the loss actually sustained by the plaintiff that the
                        defendant did not know of the special circumstances which were likely to
                        cause any enhancement of the plaintiff’s loss. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The key issue that arises at this juncture, in our view, centres on the
                        <em>role</em> of the <em>actual</em> knowledge of the defendant. Is it, as the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>
                    assumes, <em>sufficient – in and of itself – to be
                        the basis for an implied obligation on the part of the defendant that it
                        would assume responsibility for the (extraordinary) loss flowing from its
                        breach? Or</em> is <em>actual</em> knowledge
                    merely <em>a factor (and no more)</em> in ascertaining
                    whether or not there was such an obligation (a point which is implicit in
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> (especially given his classification of his approach as
                    a “prima facie assumption” which is rebuttable if the context and
                    surrounding circumstances so justify (see <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> above) but which is brought clearly to the fore by
                    Diplock LJ in <em>Robophone Facilities</em>)?
                    Notwithstanding the legendary abilities of both Lord Hoffmann and
                    Lord Diplock (as he later became) in general and their considerable
                    scholarship in the law of contract in particular (see, for example, Brice
                    Dickson, “The Contribution of Lord Diplock to the General Law of
                    Contract” (1989) 9 OJLS 441), it is our view, with the greatest of
                    respect, that the <em>former</em> proposition reflects the
                    correct state of the law. Let us elaborate. Before proceeding to do so, however,
                    we note that Prof Coote (despite his (not surprising) endorsement of the
                    concept of assumption of responsibility (see also above at <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a>)) perceptively points out that
                    Lord Diplock, whilst also adopting a similar approach to that in <em>Robophone Facilities</em> at the English Court of Appeal
                    stage of the <em>Heron II</em> (see <em>C Czarnikow Ltd v Koufos</em> [1966] 2 QB 695 at
                    727–728), might well have <em>modified his views</em>
                    in the (subsequent) House of Lords decision of <em>Photo
                        Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</em> [1980] AC 827
                    (at 848–849) (see <em>Coote</em> at
                    p 219).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    It will be recalled that the obligation or assumption of responsibility with
                    regard to the <em>loss</em> flowing as a result of a
                        <em>breach of contract</em> is (in the absence of a
                    relevant <em>express</em> term) <em>necessarily</em> an <em>implied</em> one (see
                    also above at <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a>). This proposition would,
                    of course, apply to <em>both limbs</em> in <em>Hadley</em> and is, in fact, also a premise underlying
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> as well (although it is significant to note that
                    Lord Hope appeared, also in <em>The Achilleas</em> (at
                    [36]), to suggest <em>otherwise</em>). If so, then it is
                        <em>the court</em> which <em>imputes</em> such an obligation on the defendant, albeit on an
                        <em>objective</em> basis. Looked at in this light, it
                    is our view that <em>the criterion of knowledge furnishes a
                        sufficiently objective basis on which to premise the existence (or
                        otherwise) of an implied obligation or assumption of responsibility on the
                        defendant</em>. To leave the situation open to other factors would
                    lead to unnecessary speculation as well as uncertainty. At this particular
                    juncture, it is helpful to note that, <em>unlike</em> a
                    situation relating to a term implied <em>in fact</em>
                    (which, it will be recalled, was an analogy which was utilised by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>), the court is
                        <em>not</em> concerned with embarking on a <em>gap-filling</em> exercise. Put simply, the rules relating to
                    remoteness of damage in contract law are (contrary to Lord Hoffmann’s
                    view) <em>universal and external rules of law</em>
                    applicable to <em>all</em> situations where a breach of
                    contract has occurred (what Kramer refers to as involving “the default
                    rule theory” (see <em>Kramer</em> at p 251);
                    though <em>cf</em> the characterisation by
                    Prof Robertson who refers to the remoteness rule as a “gap-filling
                    device” (see <em>Robertson</em> at pp 172 and
                    196), although the difference in view might be one of degree rather than kind,
                    depending on the extent to which parties <em>expressly</em>
                    allocate risks for the loss resulting from a breach of contract). This is only
                    just and fair to <em>all</em> parties to <em>all</em> contracts. Indeed, as AR Teo points out in <em>Chee Peng Kwan</em> (at [40]), “the law on remoteness
                    can be said to be concerned not merely with protecting the contractual bargain
                        <em>but also with the wider policy consideration</em>
                    of placing suitable limitations on contractual liabilities” [emphasis
                    added]. Whilst all this is true, we pause to observe that the necessity of
                    relying upon universal and external rules of law is one that cannot, <em>in the nature of things</em>, be avoided in any event since
                    (as explained below at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>), we are
                    dealing with a situation where the parties, <em>ex
                        hypothesi</em>, never had the issue of the breach of the contract (and
                    the ensuing loss) in mind and, if they had, ought to have provided expressly for
                    them. Indeed, and in this last-mentioned regard, AR Peh also points out, in
                        <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at [69]; and see also
                    [68]), that this is, in fact, <em>yet another policy</em>
                    consideration that must also be taken into account:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From a policy perspective, it may be questionable why the courts should
                        provide additional protection to defendants in <em>all</em> cases by imposing a higher threshold in insisting that a
                        defendant should only be liable for losses that he could be said to have
                        reasonable assumed responsibility ... As noted by Lord Reid in
                            <em>The Heron II</em> ... (at 385-386) and Andrew
                        Phang JA in <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at [71] and
                        [75]-[76]), parties in a contract case, unlike those in tort, have the
                        opportunity to direct each others’ attention to the unusual risks and
                        either can take extra precautions to safeguard his position. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   The principles in <em>Hadley</em> and
                their consistency with both logic and the idea of agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    We would also reiterate the following observations made by this court in
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at [77]–[83]), which
                    elaborate on why the principles laid down in <em>Hadley</em> not only constitute a set of universal and external rules
                    of law (which are undergirded by sound logic) but are also consistent with the
                    very essence of the law of contract itself (which gives effect to the idea of
                    the contract as an <em>agreement</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77    In this appeal, we are concerned with a claim for an <em>unliquidated</em> amount of monetary loss. This is the pith
                            and marrow of the concept of <em>damages</em>. In such a
                            situation, given that the contracting parties have not fixed in advance
                            in the contract itself the type as well as the amount of monetary loss
                            recoverable (<em>contra</em> cases involving liquidated
                            damages clauses), the courts have to formulate rules as to, inter alia,
                            what is recoverable and what is too remote to be recoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78    Two important principles feature in this process. First, the courts
                            have to formulate <em>general rules and principles premised on
                                justice and fairness</em> which would <em>apply
                                universally to all contracting parties</em> (such rules and
                            principles are commonly referred to as “default rules”).
                            In this regard, a <em>crucial factor</em> to bear in mind is
                            the fact that the parties concerned, as <em>contracting
                                parties</em>, would have <em>had an opportunity to
                                communicate with each other in advance</em> (see also
                                <em>The Heron II</em> at 386 <em>per</em>
                            Lord Reid (reproduced above at [71])). This factor is significant
                            because, although the contracting parties may not have decided to fix in
                            advance the type as well as the quantum of monetary loss recoverable
                            should a breach of contract occur, the fact remains (as just mentioned)
                                <em>that they had an opportunity to communicate with each
                                other in advance</em> on, <em>inter alia</em>,
                            this particular issue. Second, whatever general rules and principles the
                            court formulates <em>must not have the result of rewriting the
                                contract for the parties</em>, as <em>that</em>
                            contract constitutes the original bargain entered into by the parties
                            and ought (from the perspective of <em>sanctity of
                                contract</em>) to be honoured as far as is possible. All this
                            sets the legal backdrop against which we ought to view the two limbs of
                            the rule in <em>Hadley</em> and, as importantly, furnishes
                            us with the rationale as to why these two limbs are not arbitrary
                            formulations, but are, rather, considered statements of law which take
                            into account precisely the legal backdrop as well as the concomitant
                            considerations delineated in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79    It is important to reiterate, by way of <em>summary</em>,
                            the points made in the preceding paragraph: <em>The task of the
                                courts, in the context of remoteness of damage in contract, is to
                                formulate rules and principles that would apply universally to all
                                contracting parties in situations where the contracting parties have
                                not expressly provided, in advance, for what is to happen in the
                                event of a breach of their respective contracts. In doing so, the
                                courts will bear in mind the fact that the contracting parties did
                                have the opportunity to communicate with each other in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    To elaborate, damage which falls under the <em>first

                                <em>“ordinary” damage</em> (see <em>CHS CPO GmbH</em> ([55] <em>supra</em>) at [82])
                            ought to be <em>well within</em> the reasonable
                            contemplation of all of the <em>contracting parties</em>
                            concerned. Since everyone (including the contracting parties) must,
                                <em>as reasonable people</em>, be taken to know of
                            damage which flows “naturally” (<em>ibid</em>)
                            from a breach of contract, the first limb of <em>Hadley</em>
                            does <em>no</em> violence to the original bargain between
                            the contracting parties who, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, have not
                            expressly provided for what is to happen in the event of a breach of

                            the contracting parties had thought about this issue, they <em>would, in all likelihood, have agreed</em> that the

                                <em>impute</em> knowledge of such damage to them (see
                            above at [55]). Indeed, to argue otherwise would be unjust and absurd as
                            the logical conclusion of such an argument would be that the
                            contract-breaker would not be liable for any loss at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82    Damage which falls under the <em>second limb</em> of

                                damage</em> (<em>CHS CPO GmbH</em> at [83])) is
                                <em>not</em>, by its <em>very nature</em>,
                            within the reasonable contemplation of the contracting parties. In the
                            circumstances, it would be both <em>unjust and unfair</em>
                            to <em>impute</em> to them knowledge that such damage or
                            loss would arise upon a breach of contract. <em>However</em>, <em>if</em> the contracting parties,
                                <em>having had the opportunity to communicate with each other
                                in advance</em>, had <em>actual</em> (as opposed

                            the contract-breaker liable in damages for such damage. If, <em>armed with</em> such <em>actual</em> knowledge,
                            the contracting parties do not make express provision in their contract

                            Craighead put it in <em>Jackson</em> ([59] <em>supra</em>) at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where knowledge of special circumstances is relied on, the assumption
                            is that the defendant [<em>ie</em>, the contract-breaker]
                            undertook to bear any special loss which was referable to those special
                            circumstances. It is assumed too that he had the opportunity to seek to
                            limit his liability under the contract for ordinary losses in the event
                            that he was in breach of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83    It will be seen, therefore, that the two limbs of the rule in
                                <em>Hadley</em> are wholly consistent with - and, in
                            fact, give effect to - the concept of contract as an <em>agreement</em>. And, in doing so, they <em>simultaneously distinguish</em> the rules and principles on
                            remoteness in contract from those in tort. Above all, as we have seen,
                            they are just and fair, and constitute the best legal regime available,
                            given the fact that the contracting parties have not, <em>ex
                                hypothesi</em>, expressly provided for what is to happen
                            should a breach of their contract occur. It is also important to note,
                            at this juncture, that in the absence of such express contractual
                            provision, the only alternative the courts have is to formulate
                                <em>universal</em> rules and principles; the other
                            alternative - that of doing nothing - is clearly untenable and wholly
                            impractical. This is, therefore, yet another - and <em>fundamental</em> - reason why the rules and principles
                            enunciated in <em>Hadley</em> ought to continue as the
                            applicable law governing remoteness of damage in the law of contract in
                            Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In the circumstances, therefore, the universal and external rules of law (as

        <em>Hadley</em> avoids the problems in
                    <em>The Achilleas</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The approach we have suggested also harks back to the theoretical difficulties
                    referred to above (at [92]–[93]), where it had been pointed out that,
                    although the approach from interpretation (embodied in the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>) appeared to
                    furnish an ostensible external rule of guidance, it was clearly distinct from
                    the doctrine of remoteness of damage and, instead, generated (in substance) much
                        <em>uncertainty</em> (as we have explained above).
                    Neither can the approach from interpretation be justified on the basis of an
                    analogy with terms implied <em>in law</em> (a point which
                    we have also dealt with above (at <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>–<a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>)). Whilst
                    it might be argued that the principles of remoteness of damage embodied in the
                    two limbs in <em>Hadley</em> might also give rise to
                    different results (depending on the precise facts before the court), this is
                        <em>inevitable</em> as every (even) universal and
                    external rule of law must be <em>applied</em> to the
                        <em>facts</em> at hand. However, what ought to be
                        <em>avoided</em>, in our view, are approaches (such as
                    that advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>) which engender <em>excessive and
                        unnecessary</em> uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(f)   
        <em>Hadley</em> provides the necessary
                framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Indeed, at this juncture, we would note that it is <em>not</em>, generally speaking, possible to <em>avoid</em> laying down a universal and external rule of law.
                        <em>Any</em> approach is <em>necessarily</em> a <em>claim</em> to <em>universal</em> applicability. Looked at in this light,
                        <em>even</em> the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em> is,
                    notwithstanding its focus on the actual intentions of the parties themselves,
                        <em>necessarily itself</em> a universal and external
                    rule of law – albeit one (which we have explained above) that engenders
                    excessive and unnecessary uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    If the rules relating to remoteness of damage in contract law are (as we have
                    just explained) universal and external rules of law applicable to all situations
                    and which (<em>prima facie</em> at least) ensure justice
                    and fairness for all parties to all contracts, then, in the spirit of justice
                    and fairness, the <em>existing distinction</em> drawn
                    between <em>imputed</em> knowledge (under the <em>first limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>) and
                        <em>actual</em> knowledge (under the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>) suffices,
                    in our view, to provide the court with a sufficiently nuanced approach towards
                    dealing (in a <em>practical</em> manner) with whether or
                    not the defendant concerned has assumed responsibility with respect to <em>natural or ordinary loss</em> and <em>extraordinary loss</em>, respectively. In particular, where the
                    defendant is sought to be held liable for <em>extraordinary
                        loss</em>, then merely <em>imputing</em>
                    knowledge on it is unfair. <em>However</em>, if the
                    defendant <em>did</em> possess <em>actual</em> knowledge, then it is fair, in our view, that it be taken
                    to have assumed the responsibility for that (extraordinary) loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    As a matter of practical import, it might be observed, at this juncture, that,
                    in so far as extraordinary loss under the <em>second</em>
                    limb in <em>Hadley</em> is concerned, <em>much</em> will depend on the <em>precise
                        facts</em> of the case before the court. This furnishes <em>sufficient flexibility</em>, in our view, to deal with
                    difficult situations in so far as the <em>characterisation</em> of the <em>actual
                        knowledge</em> which the defendant ought to possess is concerned.
                    However, it bears noting that the concept of characterisation is not an
                    unbridled licence to lawyers or the courts to do as they please. Indeed, the
                    very factual matrix itself – coupled with logic and commonsense –
                    serve as natural constraints on all concerned. In any event, contrary to the
                    rather fanciful theories of radical theorists, this is not what, in fact, takes
                    place in practice. Indeed, the <em>interaction</em> of law
                    and fact (which necessarily takes place as the law cannot operate in an abstract
                    vacuum) is not only a hallmark of the common law system but the flexibility
                    contained therein is also one of the considerable strengths of that system as
                    well. Such interaction also ensures that the <em>qualitative as
                        well as contextual contents</em> of the circumstances which the
                    defendant must have actual knowledge of ensures a more nuanced approach that
                    avoids the possible injustice that might result (<em>cf</em>, though, a learned author’s apprehension that this
                    court’s “equation of special knowledge with liability in respect of
                    the second limb [in <em>Hadley</em>] might be
                    over-inclusive in some instances, rendering defendants liable in circumstances
                    of mere knowledge” (see <em>Goh</em> at
                    p 108)). On one view at least, such flexibility is, simultaneously, a
                    demonstration of how justice and fairness are achieved in a practical (and, by
                    its very nature, imperfect) context. However, all this is not to state that
                    different courts cannot come to the opposite conclusions based on the same facts
                    (bearing in mind that there are also other factors that have to be considered,
                    including the precise degree of probability required pursuant to the principles
                    laid down in <em>Hadley</em> (as to which, see <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at [57])). The fact situation in
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> itself furnishes an excellent
                    illustration in this regard. As we will show shortly (see <a href="#p1_115">[115]</a> below), it might have been <em>possible</em> to argue that the loss claimed by the
                    (plaintiff) shipowners in <em>The Achilleas</em> fell
                    within the <em>second limb</em> of <em>Hadley</em> and that, in the circumstances, the charterers did
                        <em>not</em> have <em>actual</em>
                    knowledge of the relevant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Alternative analyses of <em>The
                    Achilleas</em> based on the principles in <em>Hadley</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As we have seen, in <em>The Achilleas</em>, the House of
                    Lords unanimously held in favour of the (defendant) charterers (albeit on
                    somewhat different grounds in so far as the individual law lords were
                    concerned). At this juncture, we would observe that a further <em>alternative</em> analysis based on the principles in <em>Hadley</em> could <em>also possibly</em>
                    be applied to the facts of <em>The Achilleas</em> –
                    to achieve the <em>same</em> result that was arrived at by
                    the House itself. In particular, it is possible that in light of the evidence
                    from <em>the shipping industry</em> (at least as it existed
                    at that particular point in time) to the effect that the <em>type
                        of loss</em> suffered by the shipowners in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> was not recoverable (the (<em>then</em>) <em>established</em> understanding
                    being that shipowners were entitled to only the difference between the market
                    rate and the charter rate for the overrun period), the shipowners’ loss in
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> was not natural or ordinary loss
                    which fell within the first limb of <em>Hadley</em>
                        (<em>cf</em> also the approach by Lord Rodger (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>) and Baroness Hale (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>) in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> who both decided the case based on the first limb in
                        <em>Hadley</em>, albeit for different reasons). And, as
                    already explained above, the concept of assumption of responsibility would be an
                        <em>integral part of</em> the <em>first
                        limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>. However, this is a
                    mere <em>hypothetical</em> analysis (bearing in mind the
                    fact that the House did <em>not</em> accept the evidence
                    just mentioned in arriving at its decision, as well as the fact that it was
                    conceded right from the start by the charterers in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> that missing dates for a subsequent fixture was a not
                    unlikely result of late redelivery (see <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> at [53] and [90])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    It might have also been possible to argue (as we alluded to briefly above (at
                        <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>)) that applying the principles
                    laid down in <em>Hadley</em>, the loss claimed by the
                    shipowners fell within the <em>second limb</em> of
                        <em>Hadley</em> and that, in the circumstances, the
                    charterers did <em>not</em> have <em>actual</em> knowledge of the relevant circumstances. This would have
                    entailed the <em>same</em> result as that which was arrived
                    at by the House of Lords, albeit <em>without</em> having to
                    utilise the additional criterion (advocated by Lord Hoffmann) centring on
                    the assumption of responsibility by the defendant (<em>cf</em> also <em>Bridge</em> (at p 762)).
                    Indeed, consistent with the analysis proffered above, an assumption of
                    responsibility would already have been an integral part of not only the first
                    limb in <em>Hadley</em> but also the second limb as well.
                    However, this is, again, <em>only</em> a <em>hypothetical</em> example (or, rather, analysis) as the same issues
                    which arose in <em>The Achilleas</em> have not, to the best
                    of our knowledge, arisen for decision before the Singapore courts (or at least
                    before this court). When, however, a situation akin to <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> comes before the Singapore courts, what is clear is
                    that the principles in <em>Hadley</em> will have to be
                    fully argued before this court as they apply to the fact situation itself. We
                    pause – parenthetically – to note that some commentators would in
                    fact <em>disagree</em> with the argument (just considered)
                    to the effect that the loss claimed in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> falls within the <em>second
                        limb</em> of <em>Hadley</em>, arguing that the
                        <em>type</em> of loss was reasonably contemplated under
                    the <em>first</em> limb in <em>Hadley</em> although the <em>extent</em> was not
                        (<em>cf</em> also our alternative analysis based on the
                        <em>first</em> limb in <em>Hadley</em> in the preceding paragraph), distinguishing <em>The Achilleas</em> from the fact situation as well as the
                    holding (with respect to the issue of extraordinary loss pursuant to the
                        <em>second limb</em> of <em>Hadley</em>) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ld v Newman Industries Ld</em>
                    [1949] 2 KB 528 (“<em>Victoria
                    Laundry</em>”) (see, for example, <em>Peel</em> at p 8; Janet O’Sullivan, “Damages
                    for Lost Profits for Late Redelivery: How Remote is Too Remote?” [2009]
                    CLJ 34 (“<em>O’Sullivan</em>”) at
                    p 37; Gary Richard Coveney, “Damages for Late Delivery Under Time
                    Charters: Certainty at Last?” (2009) 23 Austl &amp; NZ Mar

                    pp 208-209; and <em>Halladay</em> at p 177 (see
                    also above at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>)). However, as already
                    observed in the preceding paragraph, we think it is possible to find that the
                        <em>type</em> of loss was not contemplated by the
                    parties based on the first limb in <em>Hadley</em>. Even on
                    the facts of <em>The Achilleas</em>, it is clear that at
                    least two law lords (<em>viz</em>, Lord Rodger and Baroness
                    Hale) arrived at that particular conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Notwithstanding that our alternative analysis here on <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> based on the principles in <em>Hadley</em> is a mere <em>hypothetical</em>
                    analysis, it does demonstrate that <em>the principles
                        in</em> Hadley <em>may well be sufficient to achieve
                        justice in the case at hand without the need for a further (and artificial)
                        construct of an assumption of responsibility. And</em>, as we have
                    also argued above, the element of assumption of responsibility would, looked at
                    in this light, <em>also be embodied or subsumed within the two
                        limbs in</em> Hadley <em>in any event</em>. This
                    view also derives some support from the many views expressed to the effect that
                    the <em>same</em> result is quite likely to result
                        <em>regardless</em> of which approach is used (see, for
                    example, <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at [67]) as well as
                        <em>Peel</em> (at p 12)). We should perhaps also
                    note in passing here that it would always be open to parties, placed in a
                    similar situation such as that in <em>The Achilleas</em>,
                    to exclude liability for consequential loss of this kind by inserting a suitable
                    clause in their contract (as also pointed out by Baroness Hale in <em>The Achilleas</em> (see above at [86])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    It is also significant, in our view, that the approach advocated by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em> has been
                    subject to much criticism in the academic literature. This is, in itself, not
                    necessarily conclusive by any means. However, the <em>extent</em> of the criticism is unusual. More importantly, the
                        <em>content</em> of many of the various criticisms is,
                    in many instances, very persuasive. Indeed, we have already referred to a number
                    of the more significant criticisms during the course of our analysis in the
                    preceding paragraphs of this judgment and will therefore not rehearse them again
                    (reference may also be made, in this regard, to <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) vol 1 at
                    para 26-100G). Suffice it to state that few decisions – particularly
                    of the highest appellate court in England – have been subject to so much
                    criticism in both leading textbooks as well as articles and comments in a
                    variety of international journals. In addition to the specific criticisms
                    already canvassed above, it has also been argued that the actual decision in
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> is due, rather, to “wider
                    policy considerations” which ought to be “openly explored”
                    in “future decisions” (see <em>O’Sullivan</em> at p 37; reference may also be made to
                        <em>Coveney</em> at p 209). In point of fact,
                    however, we have in fact demonstrated above (at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>) that the <em>traditional</em> rules
                    of remoteness (as embodied in <em>Hadley</em>) have
                        <em>already</em> taken into account the key <em>policy</em> considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   An extreme hypothetical example explained</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Before turning to English case law decided <em>after</em>
                    the decision in <em>The Achilleas</em> was handed down, it
                    might be appropriate to consider briefly an oft-cited hypothetical example which
                    has been utilised to demonstrate the utility as well as persuasiveness of
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> (see, for example, <em>Kramer</em>
                    at pp 269–270). This is the example of a taxi driver who, before he
                    or she accepts the fare, is informed by the passenger about a crucial meeting to
                    which that passenger must get to on time. If the taxi driver fails, in breach of
                    contract, to get the passenger to that meeting in a timely manner and, as a
                    result, the passenger suffers an enormous business loss, is the taxi driver
                    liable for that loss? Advocates of Lord Hoffmann’s approach would
                    suggest not because the taxi driver had not assumed responsibility for such
                    loss. Although this suggestion is attractive at first blush, having regard to
                    the various weaknesses inherent in that particular approach, we would suggest
                    that the <em>same</em> result could be arrived at by
                    utilising the traditional principles embodied in <em>Hadley</em>. A learned author put it well when he reasoned as follows
                    (see <em>Peel</em> at p 10):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The language of “accepting risk” is not entirely apt since
                        it can convey the idea that liability for the losses which flow from one
                        party’s breach is simply a question of discerning the intention of the
                        parties, but that is a view that has hitherto been rejected (see, e.g.
                            <em>The Heron II</em> at 422, per
                        Lord Upjohn). <em>It is preferable to say of examples
                            such as the taxi driver ... that it is not “reasonable” to
                            impose liability (</em>The Heron II <em>at
                            422), or that it is not “proper” to do so (</em>The
                        Heron II <em>at 385, per Lord Reid), for, contrary
                            to Lord Hoffmann, it is respectfully submitted that the rule of
                            remoteness is an external rule of law</em>. It is not, however, a
                        completely inflexible rule. Without suggesting that the circumstances in
                        which it might be appropriate to depart from the test of reasonable
                        contemplation of the type of loss are closed ... , <em>one
                            explanation for the likely result in the hypothetical [example]
                            considered above is that the defendant was given no reasonable
                            opportunity to limit his liability</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above reasoning is consistent with many of the points we have canvassed
                    above (including the presence of prior (and contrary) views from the House of
                    Lords as well as the fact that the two limbs in <em>Hadley</em> constitute external and independent rules of law). We
                    would add that, in an extreme situation such as the present hypothetical, much
                    would depend on the precise facts in question. This would also include, for
                    example, how the alleged special circumstances were communicated by the customer
                    to the taxi driver and what precisely was in fact communicated. All this would,
                    of course, have to be assessed on an objective basis. One would imagine that, in
                    an extreme situation such as this, there would have to be a clear and
                    unequivocal communication. It would probably have taken the following
                    form:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have to arrive at the airport on time for my flight and, if I miss my
                        flight, I will lose a business deal worth $200,000. If so, I will truly hold
                        you responsible for this loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Extreme hypothetical situations such as the one just mentioned are useful in
                    law schools as they deliver the general legal propositions sought to be conveyed
                    to the students concerned in no uncertain terms. However, what happens in the
                    real world is quite different. Even allowing for the fact that truth is
                    sometimes stranger than fiction, one can hardly imagine the taxi driver
                    accepting responsibility on the terms set out in the preceding paragraph. Even
                    if he or she did, this would have – in the nature of things – to be
                    in the form of <em>an express assumption of responsibility which
                        forms part of the contract between the parties in any event</em>. In
                    other words, in an extreme hypothetical situation, because the communication of
                    the special circumstances would have to be so clear and unequivocal, it would
                    follow that any assumption of responsibility would have to be equally clear and
                    unequivocal and that it would then <em>simultaneously</em>
                    constitute an <em>express term</em> of the contract itself.
                        <em>The resultant situation would be no different from the
                        position that Lord Hoffmann is arguing in favour of</em>. It is,
                    of course, <em>theoretically possible</em> for there to be
                    an assumption of responsibility without that assumption forming part of the
                        <em>express</em> terms of the contract as such. In our
                    view, however, this would be quite unrealistic as regard must (as just
                    mentioned) be had to the entire <em>context</em> of the
                    situation itself. Indeed, even from a <em>legal</em>
                    standpoint, it would be difficult to imagine that a court would find an
                        <em>implied</em> obligation that the taxi driver had
                    undertaken to assume responsibility for the <em>full</em>
                    extent of the loss. Even if this were so, we would imagine that there would
                        <em>also</em> be an <em>implied
                        term</em> to the effect that, absent a deliberate act on the part of
                    the taxi driver to ensure that the passenger did not arrive at the airport on
                    time, the former would be excused from liability. Hence, for example, a delay
                    that was due to a traffic jam would excuse the taxi driver from
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    However, assume for the moment that the taxi driver <em>did</em> undertake liability in an <em>express</em> manner. As already explained above, this would <em>not</em> detract from (and is, on the contrary, entirely
                    consistent with) the proposition (made above) to the effect that any assumption
                    of responsibility on the part of the defendant would hinge on his or her
                    knowledge of the special circumstances pursuant to the <em>second
                        limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em> and that that
                    assumption of responsibility would have <em>already been embodied
                        or incorporated within</em> that particular limb itself. In any event,
                    this situation would (as we have already noted) be consistent with
                    Lord Hoffmann’s approach as well. We also pointed out in the
                    preceding paragraph that it might also be argued that there was an <em>implied term</em> that the taxi driver would be excused for
                    delays that were not the result of a deliberate act intended to ensure that the
                    passenger in fact lost his business opportunity. If there was such a deliberate
                    act, – and it would be bizarre in the extreme – the imposition of
                    liability on the taxi driver might in fact be justified from both legal as well
                    as extralegal points of view. However, as we have mentioned, such extreme
                    hypothetical situations are likely to be rare and that, even if they do occur,
                    the common law of contract itself contains the necessary doctrines to avoid an
                    unjust and unfair result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subsequent developments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Subsequent English case law and the attempt at
                integration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    However, English case law following <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> has sought to <em>integrate</em>
                    the two limbs in <em>Hadley</em> with the approach
                    advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>
                    itself. It is obvious – perhaps for one or more of the reasons set out
                    above – that the English courts were uncomfortable with endorsing,
                    unconditionally, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann, especially since
                        <em>Hadley</em> had stood as the established law for
                    150 years (see, for example, the English High Court decisions of <em>ASM Shipping Ltd of India v TTMI Ltd of England (The “Amer
                        Energy”)</em> [2009] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 293 at [19]

                        and Another</em> [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 59 at [71]). The
                    approach from integration (hereafter “the integrated approach”) is
                    a rather ingenious one. An early hint at such an approach may be found in the
                    judgment of Toulson LJ (with whom Richards and Mummery LJJ agreed) in
                    the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Supershield Ltd v

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> remains a standard rule
                        but it has been rationalised on the basis that it reflects the expectation
                        to be imputed to the parties in the ordinary case, ie that a contract
                        breaker should ordinarily be liable to the other party for damage resulting
                        from his breach if, but only if, at the time of making the contract a
                        reasonable person in his shoes would have had damage of that kind in mind as
                        not unlikely to result from a breach. However, <em>South
                            Australia</em> and <em>Transfield
                            Shipping</em> are authority that there may be cases where the
                        court, on examining the contract and the commercial background, decides that
                        the standard approach would not reflect the expectation or intention
                        reasonably to be imputed to the parties. In those two instances the effect
                        was exclusionary; the contract breaker was held not to be liable for loss
                        which resulted from its breach although some loss of the kind was not
                        unlikely. But logically the same principle may have an inclusionary effect.
                        If, on the proper analysis of the contract against its commercial
                        background, the loss was within the scope of the duty, it cannot be regarded
                        as too remote, even if it would not have occurred in ordinary
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    However, the clearest statement of the integrated approach is perhaps best
                    exemplified in the judgment of Hamblen J in the recent English High Court
                    decision of <em>Sylvia Shipping Co Ltd v Progress Bulk Carriers
                        Ltd (The “Sylvia”)</em> [2010] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 81 (“<em>Sylvia Shipping</em>”), who
                    referred (at [40]) to the effect of <em>The Achilleas</em>
                    as resulting “in <em>an amalgam</em> of the orthodox
                    and the broader approach” [emphasis added]. The “orthodox
                    approach”, in the learned judge’s view (at [27]), “reflects
                    the generally accepted remoteness test based on [<em>Hadley</em>] and subsequent cases (what Lord Hoffmann described
                    [in <em>The Achilleas</em>] as “the ordinary
                    foreseeabilty rule”)”. The “broader approach”, on
                    the other hand is, in the view of Hamblen J, embodied in that proffered by
                    Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>, and which is
                    described (at [30]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Hoffmann, whilst recognising that the orthodox approach will be
                        applicable in the “great majority of cases”, nevertheless
                        considered that it may not be sufficient in cases “in which the
                        context, surrounding circumstances or general understanding in the relevant
                        market shows that a party would not reasonably have been regarded as
                        assuming responsibility for such losses” (para 9 [of <em>The Achilleas</em>]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    At this juncture, it is apposite to set out Hamblen J’s statement
                    of the integrated approach in full (in order to capture both the relevant
                    statement of principle as well as its context), as follows (at
                    [40]–[51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    In my judgment, the decision in <em>The
                                Achilleas</em> results in an amalgam of the orthodox and the
                            broader approach. The orthodox approach remains the general test of
                            remoteness applicable in the great majority of cases. However, there may
                            be “unusual” cases, such as <em>The
                                Achilleas</em> itself, in which the context, surrounding
                            circumstances or general understanding in the relevant market make it
                            necessary specifically to consider whether there has been an assumption
                            of responsibility. This is most likely to be in those relatively rare
                            cases where the application of the general test leads or may lead to an
                            unquantifiable, unpredictable, uncontrollable or disproportionate
                            liability or where there is clear evidence that such a liability would
                            be contrary to market understanding and expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41.    In the great majority of cases it will not be necessary specifically
                            to address the issue of assumption of responsibility. Usually the fact
                            that the type of loss arises in the ordinary course of things or out of
                            special known circumstances will carry with it the necessary assumption
                            of responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42.    This is consistent with the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in which he
                            makes it clear that the orthodox approach is the “<em>prima facie</em>” rule which will apply in the
                            “great majority of cases” (para 9 [of <em>The Achilleas</em>]) and that “cases of
                            departure from the ordinary foreseeability rule based on individual
                            circumstances will be unusual” (para 11 [of <em>The Achilleas</em>]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43.    It is also consistent with the judgment of Lord Hope in which he
                            recognised that where the loss claimed reflects what happens in ordinary
                            circumstances (ie is within the first limb of the so-called rule in
                                <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em>) then an assumption
                            of responsibility can be presumed: “That is why the damages that
                            are recoverable for breach of contract are limited to what happens in
                            ordinary circumstances—in the great multitude of cases, as
                            Alderson B put it in <em>Hadley v
                                Baxendale</em> —where an assumption of responsibility
                            can be presumed” (para 36 [of <em>The
                                Achilleas</em>]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.    It is also consistent with subsequent authorities which have
                            considered the effect of <em>The

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“17. ... First, I do not consider that the House of Lords (at

                            expectations in that market might be more common, I do not consider that
                            he was intending to say that in all shipping cases (as opposed to the

                            refined, will no longer apply. If he was saying that, it was not a view
                            shared by the majority and it would be heterodox to say the

                            (at page 71) that he would be “highly surprised” if
                                <em>The Achilleas</em> established a new test
                            for the recoverability of damages for breach of contract, and noted that
                            Flaux J had been “wholly unpersuaded” that they had
                            done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    Most importantly, in <em>Supershield Ltd v Siemens
                                Building Technologies FE Ltd</em> [2010] 1 Lloyd's
                            Rep349, the Court of Appeal summarised the position as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">43. <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> remains a
                            standard rule but it has been rationalised on the basis that it reflects
                            the expectation to be imputed to the parties in the ordinary case, ie
                            that a contract breaker should ordinarily be liable to the other party
                            for damage resulting from his breach if, but only if, at the time of
                            making the contract a reasonable person in his shoes would have had
                            damage of that kind in mind as not unlikely to result from a breach.
                            However, <em>South Australia</em> and <em>Transfield Shipping</em> are authority that there may
                            be cases where the court, on examining the contract and the commercial
                            background, decides that the standard approach would not reflect the
                            expectation or intention reasonably to be imputed to the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48.    The orthodox approach therefore remains the “standard
                            rule” and it is only in relatively unusual cases, such as
                                <em>The Achilleas</em> itself, where a
                            consideration of assumption of responsibility may be required.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49.    In my judgment, it is important that it be made clear that there is no
                            new generally applicable legal test of remoteness in damages. It appears
                            that in a number of cases this is being argued and that decisions are
                            being challenged for failing to recognize or apply the assumption of
                            responsibility test. This results in confusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50.    In the vast majority of cases tribunals of fact can and should be able
                            to apply the well established remoteness test with which they are
                            familiar and which, in the vast majority of cases, works perfectly
                            well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    In this connection I note the conclusions of <em>Chitty</em> at para 26-100G:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Contractual liability is of course based on express or implied
                            agreement, and it is argued that the reason a party who has broken the
                            contract should be held liable for losses that were not unusual, or
                            which he had brought home to him might occur, is that (unless it is
                            agreed otherwise) he can be taken to have agreed to compensate them. But
                            it does not follow that liability for likely losses should be limited by
                            a vague criterion such as “assumption of responsibility”.
                            Rather it is submitted that it is better to have a simple rule that the
                            party in breach is be liable for all losses that are sufficiently likely
                            to occur in the usual case, or whose likelihood has been brought home to
                            him when the contract was made, unless he has validly excluded or
                            restricted his liability. It has been cogently argued that there are
                            limits to the extent that it is feasible to determine all issues by
                            reference to an assumption of responsibility. In relation to the extent
                            of liability for losses suffered by the innocent party as the result of
                            a breach, there will seldom be any “factual foundation for making
                            a determination as to whether the defendant implicitly assumed
                            responsibility for the risk in question”. It is thus to be hoped
                            that the approach adopted by the majority in <em>The
                                Achilleas</em> will be applied by the courts only in
                            exceptional circumstances, such as those emphasised by
                            Lord Hoffmann in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    As already mentioned, the integrated approach is an ingenious one in so far as
                    it attempts to reconcile the approach in <em>Hadley</em> on
                    the one hand and the new approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em> (centring on the assumption of
                    responsibility by the defendant) on the other. With the greatest respect,
                    however, the result, whilst attractive at first blush, is – in <em>substance</em> at least – less than
                    satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Put simply, the integrated approach is, at bottom, an acceptance and
                    endorsement of the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The Achilleas</em>. If so, this approach ought not to be
                    followed for the various reasons already set out in detail above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    We pause to observe that one other possible method of
                    “integration” (not hitherto considered) is, first, to
                    “preserve” the <em>first limb</em> in
                        <em>Hadley</em> in its <em>original
                        form</em> by <em>excluding</em> the assumption of
                    responsibility test advocated by Lord Hoffmann (in so far as it is
                        <em>presumed</em> that where the loss falls within the
                    first limb in <em>Hadley</em>, there would be an assumption
                    of responsibility, and, accordingly, there would be no need to apply the
                    assumption of responsibility test) and by applying it to <em>only</em> the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>. In other words, <em>actual</em> knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition to
                    satisfy what was hitherto the <em>second limb</em> in
                        <em>Hadley</em>; <em>in
                        addition</em>, it must now be demonstrated that the defendant
                    concerned had <em>assumed responsibility</em> for the
                    (extraordinary) loss which has occurred. <em>However</em>,
                    for the detailed reasons set out earlier in this judgment (above at <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> and <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a>–<a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>), we are
                    of the view that the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley already incorporates or embodies</em> the concept of
                    assumption of responsibility, <em>albeit in a more objective and
                        limited fashion</em> than that advocated by Lord Hoffmann in
                        <em>The Achilleas</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    We would observe further that the approach just mentioned is, in fact,
                        <em>consistent</em> with the approach which we have
                    adopted (which is to endorse the principles laid down in <em>Hadley</em>) <em>to the extent that</em> it
                    views (as we have seen) the <em>first limb</em> in
                        <em>Hadley</em> as incorporating or embodying the
                    concept of assumption of responsibility. <em>However</em>,
                    it does not, with respect, take the logic inherent in its application to the
                    first limb in <em>Hadley</em> to its logical conclusion. If
                    it had, then it is (as explained above at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>) clear that the <em>second limb</em>
                    in <em>Hadley</em> ought <em>also</em>
                    to be treated as having incorporated or embodied the concept of assumption of
                    responsibility as well and that there is therefore no need to introduce an
                    additional criterion or test of assumption of responsibility which would not
                    only be otiose but would also merely serve (as we have also sought to explain
                    above) to introduce (in effect) unnecessary subjectivity as well as uncertainty
                    into a situation which, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, does not
                    relate to the actual intentions of the parties as such (except by way of an
                    imputation by the court itself by way of a <em>universal</em> principle, which is contained within the <em>second limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>
                    itself).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Further, the view that there ought not to be a sharp distinction drawn between
                    the two limbs in <em>Hadley</em> (which is by no means a
                    recent development (see, for example, the House of Lords decision of <em>R and H Hall, Limited v W H Pim (Junior) and
                        Company, Limited</em> (1928) 33 Com Cas 324 at 334,
                        <em>per</em> Lord Shaw of Dunfermline (observing
                    that the two limbs “need not be antithetically treated: they may run into
                    each other and, indeed, be one”); reference may also be made to <em>Robertson Quay</em> (and the decisions cited therein at [59])
                    as well as the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Kpohraror
                        v Woolwich Building Society</em> [1996] 4 All ER 119 at 127-128
                    and the English High Court decision of <em>Satef-Huttenes
                        Albertus SpA v Paloma Tercera Shipping Co SA (The
                        “Pegase”)</em> [1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 175
                    at 182) actually serves – if we accept the argument made above to the
                    effect that the <em>first limb</em> in <em>Hadley necessarily imputes</em> an assumption of responsibility or an
                    implied obligation on the part of the defendant – to buttress the related
                    argument to the effect that <em>the second limb in Hadley ought
                        not to be interpreted in a manner different from the first limb of the
                        same</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Some Australian authorities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It is, admittedly, relatively soon for <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> to have been considered by courts across the
                    Commonwealth. However, there have, to the best of our knowledge, been (in
                    addition to the English decisions discussed in the preceding section of this
                    judgment) a few Australian decisions which have referred to <em>The Achilleas</em> (albeit without shedding much light on the issues
                    canvassed above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <em>Russell
                        v The Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Archdiocese of Sydney
                        and Another</em> (2008) 72 NSWLR 559 (“<em>Russell</em>”), Basten JA (with whose reasons
                    both Giles and Campbell JAA agreed) referred to <em>both</em> the traditional approach in <em>Hadley as
                        well as</em> Lord Hoffmann’s reference to the concept of
                    assumption of responsibility in <em>The Achilleas</em>.
                    However, there was no detailed analysis of the relationship between both
                    approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The same court, in <em>Dome Resources NL and Another v Silver
                        and Another</em> (2008) 72 NSWLR 693, referred (at 711) only
                    in passing to <em>The Achilleas –</em> and in the
                    context of the doctrine of consideration only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    In the (also) New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <em>Evans &amp; Associates v European Bank Ltd</em> (2009)
                    255 ALR 171 (“<em>Evans &amp; Associates</em>”), Campbell JA
                    referred (at [58], and as was the case in <em>Russell</em>
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>)) to <em>both</em> the traditional approach in <em>Hadley as
                        well as</em> the concept of assumption of responsibility which
                    (significantly, perhaps) the learned judge states as having “recently
                    been <em>reiterated</em> in”
                    <em>The Achilleas</em>. This observation is, with respect,
                    ambiguous and, if at all, appears to support the proposition endorsed above to
                    the effect that the traditional approach in <em>Hadley already
                        embodies as well as incorporates the concept of assumption of responsibility
                        in any event</em>. Further, as in <em>Russell</em>, there was no detailed analysis of the various issues
                    raised as a result of <em>The Achilleas</em> (in
                    particular, the approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in that
                    decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    It should also be noted that Gyles AJA did also observe in <em>Evans &amp; Associates</em> (at [125]) that “[t]he
                    complications of changing circumstances in relation to contractual damages are
                    apparent from the recent decision of the House of Lords in [<em>The Achilleas</em>]”. Again, however, this is, at best, a
                    neutral observation only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   A short coda</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    A short coda is in order. In a very recent paper (which originated in a
                    lecture given to the Edinburgh Centre for Commercial Law on 12 May 2009),
                    Lord Hoffmann in fact revisited as well as explained further the decision
                    in <em>The Achilleas</em> (see Lord Hoffmann,
                    “The <em>Achilleas</em>: Custom and Practice or
                    Foreseeability?” (2010) 14 Edin LR 47 (“<em>Hoffmann</em>”)). The decision in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> in general and Lord Hoffmann’s views in
                    particular ought, strictly speaking, to be interpreted on their own terms.
                    Nevertheless, this paper sheds some interesting light on the decision itself.
                    However, it does not, with the greatest of respect, meet the difficulties raised
                    above, particularly in respect of Lord Hoffmann’s own approach
                    centring on the concept of assumption of responsibility by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    We do not propose to deal with the paper in any detail and, in any event, this
                    would not be the correct venue to do so. Hence, a very brief summary of the main
                    points and even briefer observations (which relate to points already raised
                    earlier in this judgment) will have to suffice for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Lord Hoffmann’s principal objection to reliance on the principles
                    laid down in <em>Hadley</em> (which he terms (in <em>Hoffmann</em> at p 50) “the orthodox
                    approach”) have to do with what he observes “is the high degree of
                    indeterminacy which a pure foreseeability test creates” (<em>id</em> at p 51; see also at p 52). The learned
                    author is also concerned about a related point (or consequence) that “the
                    cases show that [the concepts of kind of loss and degree of probability under
                    “the orthodox approach”] are open to very considerable
                    manipulation to achieve what the court considers to be a fair result”
                        (<em>id</em> at p 52). Indeed, he refers to such
                    “manipulation” as an “intellectual sleight of hand”
                        (<em>id</em> at p 54). Lord Hoffmann is also
                    of the view (<em>id</em> at p 52) that the fact
                    situation in <em>The Achilleas</em> did not allow the
                    reliance on <em>Victoria Laundry</em> in order to achieve
                    the same result, albeit by reference to “the orthodox approach” (a
                    point with which some commentators agree). He also refers (<em>id</em> at pp 53 and 56) to the hypothetical of the taxi driver
                    referred to above (at <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In Lord Hoffmann’s view, the concept of assumption of
                    responsibility (which he advocated in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>) is more effective; in the learned author’s words
                        (<em>id</em> at p 55):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is: what obligation to make compensation for breach of
                        contract would <em>a reasonable observer</em>
                        understand the contracting party to have <em>undertaken</em>? [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    We have already considered the treatment of <em>Victoria
                        Laundry</em> (above at <a href="#p1_115">[115]</a>) as
                    well as the hypothetical of the taxi driver (above at <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a>–<a href="#p1_120">[120]</a>). More
                    importantly, perhaps, the critiques from indeterminacy as well as manipulation
                    levelled by the learned author against the traditional principles embodied in
                        <em>Hadley</em> are, with the greatest of respect,
                    misconceived. As already noted above (at <a href="#p1_110">[110]</a>), there will always be a measure of uncertainty when any
                    rule or principle of law (even an extremely established one) is applied to the
                    facts, simply because the possible fact situations are innumerable. However,
                    this is not, as we understand it, the kind of indeterminacy referred to by
                    Lord Hoffmann since such an understanding would apply equally to the
                    application of <em>every</em> rule or principle of law
                        <em>(including the application of rules and principles based
                        on the concept of assumption of responsibility)</em>. If so, then it
                    is respectfully suggested that the traditional rules and principles of
                    remoteness of damage which find their origins in the two limbs in <em>Hadley</em> are <em>no more</em>
                    indeterminate than those based on the concept of assumption of responsibility.
                    Indeed, as we have sought to demonstrate above, the former are, in fact, more
                    stable and objective – in part because they are <em>external rules</em> having <em>universal</em>
                    application. Indeed, as we have also sought to demonstrate, it is <em>the concept of assumption of responsibility</em> that
                    engenders uncertainty. And, in so far as the critique of manipulation is
                    concerned, we would prefer – as we have pointed out above (at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>) – the <em>quite
                        different term, “flexibility”</em>. We hasten to add
                    that the “flexibility” we are referring to is no euphemism; it is
                    a desirable quality in its own right which does not rely on any manipulation or
                    intellectual sleight of hand by the court to arrive at a pre-determined result.
                    As we have explained, the flexibility lies in how the facts are characterised
                    and how the law is applied to those facts. It is, in fact, a truism to state
                    that the law does not operate in an abstract vacuum, but to individual fact
                    situations (see also above at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>). If,
                    as a result, the court arrives at a substantively fair result, that is, in fact,
                    the ultimate aim and purpose of the enterprise of the law itself (see also
                    generally the Singapore High Court decision of <em>United
                        Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                    2 SLR(R) 425 at [4]-[9]). However, the desire to arrive at a
                    substantively fair result does not mean that the rules and principles of the law
                    can be manipulated. As observed in a recent lecture delivered at the University
                    of Hong Kong (see Andrew Phang, “Doctrine and Fairness in the Law of
                    Contract” in <em>The Common Law Lecture Series
                        2008–2009</em> (The University of Hong Kong, 2010) (Jessica
                    Young and Rebecca Lee gen eds), pp 17–100 at
                    pp 18-24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Put simply, the central thesis of the present lecture is this: The rules
                        and principles which constitute the <em>doctrine</em>
                        of the law are not ends in themselves but are, rather, the means through
                        which the courts arrive at <em>substantively fair</em>
                        outcomes in the cases before them in <em>every</em>
                        area of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[It should be added] that neither is more important than the other. In
                        other words, the desire to arrive at a fair outcome does not mean that the
                        courts can manipulate legal doctrine in an arbitrary fashion. Indeed, part
                        of [the] task in the present lecture is to demonstrate – through
                        illustrations from the law of contract - that legal
                        doctrine is a coherent body of rules and principles which contain many
                        common threads or linkages. Hence, any attempt to manipulate them in order
                        to arrive at a predetermined result would be both artificial as well as
                        unacceptable, and would instead lead to a loss of legitimacy in the law in
                        the eyes of both the legal profession as well as the public alike. [It
                        should also be mentioned], at this juncture, that academic literature is
                        also important in the analysis as well as formulation of legal doctrine,
                        especially with regard to the consideration of nascent and/or controversial
                        areas of the law. However, [one pauses] to mention (parenthetically) that,
                        whilst there is the need for the consideration as well as citation of
                        academic writings, there is also the need for such writings to be <em>relevant</em> inasmuch as, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, esoteric and/or highly abstract discourse ought to be
                        avoided. In other words, whilst academic writings must always maintain their
                        intellectual rigour, it must never be forgotten that their <em>highest</em> calling (and achievement) consists, in the
                        final analysis, in their contribution to the legal <em>profession</em> as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, legal doctrine is not an end itself. Its primary
                        function is to guide the court, in a reasoned fashion, to arrive at
                            <em>a fair result</em> in the case before it. Here,
                        too, academic literature has a potentially significant (perhaps even
                        pivotal) role to play. This is because, in some quarters, there has
                            - particularly with the advent of postmodern legal
                        thought - been an increased (and, unfortunately,
                        increasingly) skeptical view taken of the law in general and legal
                        objectivity in particular. Such an approach is, on any view, both corrosive
                        as well as destructive. Whilst one cannot deny that the <em>application</em> of objective rules and principles is a <em>dynamic process</em> which may therefore give rise (on
                        occasion at least) to some unpredictability as well as uncertainty
                        (particularly in an imperfect world), it is certainly the <em>very antithesis</em> of the law to argue that the law is wholly
                        subjective and that (putting it crudely) “anything goes”.
                        Indeed, as [was] observed in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private
                            Ltd</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is important to stress that notwithstanding many academic
                            critiques to the effect that commercial certainty and predictability are
                            chimerical, it cannot be gainsaid that the <em>perception</em> of their importance is deeply entrenched
                            within the commercial legal landscape in general and in the individual
                            psyches of commercial parties (and even non-commercial parties, for that
                            matter) in particular. It may be worth observing that most of these
                            critiques stem from a radical view of the law. To put it bluntly, many
                            of such views stem from the premise that objectivity of the law is not
                            merely elusive but positively illusory. In particular, such a sceptical
                            approach is based on the idea that everything is subjective. This is, of
                            course, the very antithesis of the very enterprise of the law itself.
                            Such an approach also conveniently misses its own absolute cast.
                            Unfortunately, though, it is an absolute view that dispirits and
                            disempowers. It is profoundly negative and ought to be avoided at all
                            costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, the view that the law is subjective (and, consequently, arbitrary)
                        would cause an irreparable loss in the <em>legitimacy</em> of the law in the eyes of <em>the
                            public</em>. And, as just mentioned, it would also dispirit as
                        well as disempower lawyers, judges and students alike. And, from just a
                        logical perspective (as also pointed out in the judgment just mentioned),
                        the very view that all law is subjective is <em>itself</em> an “absolute” proposition that thus
                        involves circularity and (more importantly) self-contradiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]implistic reductionism must, [it should be added], be assiduously
                        avoided by all concerned (including the courts) – if nothing else,
                        because life is too complex. [The preferred approach is] viewing doctrine
                        and fairness as an <em>interactive</em> process,
                        although the attainment of a fair result in each case is the ultimate aim of
                        the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Indeed, as we have sought to demonstrate above, it is (on the <em>contrary</em>) the concept of <em>assumption
                        of responsibility</em> which engenders excessive uncertainty (see
                    generally above at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a>-<a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>) – not least because it is premised
                    on a very broad and vague concept of interpretation, when what is in fact
                    required are clear and specific rules and principles of law (which criterion is
                    fulfilled, in our view, by the traditional rules and principles of law relating
                    to remoteness of damage in contract law).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Consistent with the analysis set out above, we take this opportunity to
                    confirm the approach relating to remoteness of damage in the law of contract as
                    set out in the decision of this court in <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> (which affirmed the principles laid down in <em>Hadley</em>). We also take this opportunity to state that the
                    approach advocated by Lord Hoffmann in <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> is not the law in Singapore, except to the extent that
                    the learned law lord’s reliance on the concept of assumption of
                    responsibility by the defendant is already incorporated or embodied in both
                    limbs in <em>Hadley</em> itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Let us turn now to apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of the
                    present proceedings – specifically, the damages to be awarded in the
                        <em>post-</em>breach context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The Appellants contended that the post-breach losses (if at all) suffered by
                    the Respondent were not recoverable at law. They contended that the issue of
                    recovery of post-breach losses was not just about remoteness (which the Judge
                    based her decision upon). Instead, they contended that the Respondent was
                    claiming for damages arising from alleged continuing effects of their breaches
                    and that there was no legal authority for such a claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In our view, the losses that the Respondent is claiming in this particular
                    context are nothing more than losses incurred based on the effect of the
                    Appellants’ breaches and it is quite illogical as well as unrealistic to
                    expect losses to cease immediately after the breaches had stopped. We therefore
                    agree with the Judge that the Appellants are liable for the post-breach losses,
                    and that she correctly took into account the trailing-off effect when assessing
                    damages to account for the fact that with the passage of time, more and more
                    consumers would become aware of the changes, and that the after-effects of the
                    breaches would (as a consequence) decrease accordingly. As for the period of six
                    months which the Judge decided as constituting the duration for the Post-Breach
                    Period, we are respectfully of the view (like the AR) that (given the nature of
                    the breaches themselves) a period of 12 months would constitute a
                    reasonable period of time given that it would take some time for the consumer to
                    become aware of the changes. However, like the Judge, we are also of the view
                    that the damages awardable for that particular period should be halved in order
                    to reflect the fact that there ought to be some allowance made for a gradual
                    decrease in the effect of the Appellants’ breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    We also note that the Judge applied the principles in the first limb of
                        <em>Hadley</em>, with the result that the Respondent
                    should receive damages as may be fairly and reasonably be considered to arise
                    naturally according to the usual course of things as a result of the
                    Appellants’ breaches of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    As already explained above, we are of the view that the applicable legal
                    principles are those which have their source in <em>Hadley</em> (and which were confirmed by this court in <em>Robertson Quay</em>). We also agree with the Judge (for the
                    reasons set out above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>) that, having
                    regard to the nature of the loss claimed by the Respondent during the
                    Post-Breach Period, the damages which would be awardable would fall within the
                        <em>first limb</em> in <em>Hadley</em>. It now remains to ascertain the <em>quantum</em> of damages to be awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Adopting the same methodology as that applied in ascertaining the quantum of
                    damages which ought to be awarded to the Respondent during the Breach Period
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>–<a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>), we note, first, that the predicted or
                    projected percentage change in actual gross sales during the period between
                    February 2007 and January 2008 can be estimated to be 2.31 per cent
                    (-0.38 per cent + 2.69 per cent) – a figure which we find to be
                    not unreasonable, having regard to the overall circumstances (including
                    Fish &amp; Co’s projections during <em>the Breach
                        Period</em> itself (see above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>)) and which reflects (in this <em>higher</em> projected percentage change in actual gross sales
                    compared to that with respect to the Breach Period) the <em>continuation</em> of the upward trend noted above (at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>). We also note that the predicted or
                    projected gross sales during the preceding period (<em>viz</em>, between February 2006 and January 2007), as calculated
                    above, was $2,803,911.82 (see above at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>). In the circumstances, therefore (and having regard to the
                    predicted or projected percentage change of 2.31 per cent), the <em>predicted or projected</em> gross sales during the period
                    between February 2007 and January 2008 would be $2,868,682.18. Having regard to
                    the fact that the <em>actual</em> gross sales was
                        $2,493,281.65,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> the difference between the predicted or projected gross sales and
                    the actual gross sales is $375,400.53 (<em>ie</em>,
                    $2,868,682.18 – $2,493,281.65). Taking into account the profit margin of
                    52.38 per cent (see above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>) <em>as well
                        as</em> the fact that the damages to be awarded during the Post-Breach
                    Period are for a duration of <em>12 months</em> (which
                    amount should, in our view, be adjusted by half in order to take into account
                    (as did the Judge) the fact that there ought to be some allowance made for a
                    gradual decrease in the effect of the Appellants’ breaches (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_143">[143]</a>)), the amount of damages that
                    ought to be awarded to the Respondent during this particular period is <em>$98,317.40</em> (<em>ie</em>,
                    $375,400.53 ÷ 2 × 52.38 per
                    cent).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal in part inasmuch as the
                    total amount of damages to be awarded to the Respondent is <em>$193,967.38</em> (comprising $95,649.98 for damages to be awarded
                    during the Breach Period (see above at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a>)
                        <em>and</em> $98,317.40 for damages to be awarded
                    during the Post-Breach Period (see above at <a href="#p1_146">[146]</a>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In so far as the costs of the present appeals are concerned, each party is to
                    bear its own costs. As for the costs of the proceedings below, both the costs
                    orders before the AR as well as the Judge are to remain. The usual consequential
                    orders will apply.</p>
