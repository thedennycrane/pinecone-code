<p class="Judg-Author">
        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application was made shortly after the end
                    of the trial involving a dispute between the plaintiff, Mr Tang Chay Seng
                    (“TCS”), and his nephew, the defendant, Mr Tung Yang Wee,
                    Arthur (“Arthur”). The dispute was over an alleged breach of the
                    former’s registered trade marks by the latter and allegations of passing
                    off. Arthur applied to amend his pleadings. I allowed the application and set
                    out below the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       TCS, who operated a pork noodle stall known as
                    “Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles” at Apt Blk 465 Crawford Lane
                    #01-12, Singapore 190465, was the registered proprietor of two trade marks in
                    relation to his business. His trade marks included the words Hill Street Tai Hwa
                    Pork Noodle, Chinese characters (namely “???”
                    and “???????”) as well as graphic depictions of
                    a suspension bridge and a bowl of noodles with chopsticks. Arthur’s pork
                    noodle stall at VivoCity Food Court (the “VivoCity Stall”) used a
                    signboard with the Chinese characters
                        “???”, as well as Korean
                    and Japanese characters not found in TCS’s trade marks. Furthermore,
                    Arthur’s sign had no English words and no depiction of either a suspension
                    bridge or a bowl of noodles with chopsticks. Arthur, who appeared in person,
                    pleaded that he had not infringed TCS’s trade marks and that he was not
                    liable for passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       During the trial, Arthur applied for leave to
                    amend his Defence and Counterclaim in two ways. First, he sought to plead that
                    TCS had consented to his use of the sign
                        “???” for the VivoCity
                    Stall. The reason for this amendment was obvious. Under s 27(1) of the
                    Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), a trade mark
                    is infringed only if a mark is used without the consent of its registered
                    proprietor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Secondly, as one of the issues in the passing
                    off action concerned Arthur’s of TCS’s culinary awards in an
                    advertisement in the <em>Lianhe Zaobao</em> on
                    5 November 2008, Arthur sought to amend his Defence to assert that TCS had
                    consented to the use by him of the culinary awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As Arthur did not file an affidavit in support
                    of his application to amend his Defence and Counterclaim, the hearing of the
                    application to amend his pleadings was adjourned until he had filed the said
                    affidavit. The amendment application was therefore heard on 8 April 2010,
                    after the trial had been completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In his affidavit in support of his application
                    Arthur stated at paras 3, 4 and 7 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    I am a layman and have no training in the legal
                            field.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    I realise now that my Defence and Counterclaim had
                            been too brief …. As a layman, I just realised that my
                            explanation was inadequate in the foresaid document and I failed to show
                            how evidence submitted to this Honourable Court is
                            relevant….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    The amendment that I sought is also consistent with
                            the content of my [affidavit of evidence-in-chief] dated
                                20<sup>th</sup> January 2010. Even though amendment
                            is coming in at a late stage, Mr Deepak Natverlal had the
                            opportunity to cross-examine me on these amendments during trial.
                            Therefore, the plaintiff will not be prejudiced since Mr Deepak had
                            been afforded a sufficient opportunity to address the substance of the
                            amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the application should be allowed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to Order 15 Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule, the Court
                        may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ,
                        or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise
                        as my be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Whether an amendment to pleadings should be
                    allowed is a matter of discretion for the trial judge. The approach that courts
                    should take with respect to amendment of pleadings was outlined by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Wright Norman and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking
                        Corp Ltd</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 640, at [6] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that an amendment which would enable the real issues
                        between the parties to be tried should be allowed subject to penalties on
                        costs and adjournment, if necessary, unless the amendment would cause
                        injustice or injury to the opposing party which could not be compensated by
                        costs or otherwise: see <em>Cropper v Smith</em> (1884)
                        26 Ch D 700; <em>Tildesley v Harper</em> (1878)
                        10 Ch D 393. This is so even though the omission was caused by
                        carelessness or the application for amendment was made very late in the day:
                            <em>per</em> Brett MR in <em>Clarapede &amp; Co v Commercial Union Association</em> [1883]
                        32 WR 262 at 263.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Court of Appeal added at [23] that the most
                    important question the court must ask itself is whether or not the ends of
                    justice are served by allowing the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It does not always follow that an amendment
                    should be allowed where the other party can be compensated with costs. In
                        <em>Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd</em> [1987]
                    AC 189 (“<em>Ketteman”</em>) Lord
                    Griffiths, who pointed out, at 220, that “justice cannot always be
                    measured in terms of money” explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation
                        imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather
                        than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues,
                        the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate expectation that the trial
                        will determine the issues one way or the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The courts have been careful to differentiate
                    between an amendment that merely clarifies an issue in dispute and one that
                    raises a totally different issue at too late a stage. As Lords Griffiths
                    said in <em>Ketteman</em>, at 220, “to allow an
                    amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end
                    of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to
                    renew the fight on an entirely different defence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     
          <em>Ketteman</em> has
                    been applied in a number of cases in Singapore: see <em>Sin Leng
                        Industries Pte Ltd v Ong Chai Teck and others</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 235, Lam Soon Oil and Soap Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and another v
                    Whang Tar Choung and another [2001] 3 SLR(R) 451 and   Hong Leong
                    Finance Ltd v Famco (S) Pte Ltd and others [1992] 2 SLR(R)
                224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The present case was rather different from the
                    situation envisaged in <em>Ketteman</em>. Here, although
                    the trial had been completed, no new evidence was required in relation to the
                    proposed amendment to introduce the defence of consent to the use of an
                    allegedly infringing trade mark. The facts pertaining to the proposed defence of
                    consent were fully stated in Arthur’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”). In his AEIC, Arthur stated that TCS had given his
                    consent to the use of “???”
                    by him for the VivoCity Stall when he and his father met TCS on 31 July
                    2008. Furthermore, Arthur referred to a congratulatory message that had
                    accompanied a pot of flowers sent by TCS to him when he started the VivoCity
                    Stall. He pointed out that TCS’s congratulatory message, which was
                    addressed to “???”, had
                    included the words “May your business prosper”. Thus, Arthur
                    asserted that TCS did not mind the use by him of
                        “???”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     TCS’s counsel, Mr Deepak Natverlal
                    (“Mr Natverlal”), cross-examined Arthur on his assertions that TCS
                    had consented to his use of the name“???”.
                    Arthur’s father, Mr Tung Chye Hong, was also cross-examined on the
                    issue of consent. Apart from questioning Arthur on TCS’s alleged consent
                    to the use of the name “???”
                    for the VivoCity Stall, Mr Natverlal also cross-examined Arthur on
                    TCS’s congratulatory message.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     TCS was also given an opportunity to address
                    the issue of the congratulatory message. He was cross-examined by Arthur on the
                    message and during the trial, his counsel reiterated that his position was that
                    despite the congratulatory message, he had not consented to the use by Arthur of
                    the sign
                “???”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for whether TCS had consented to
                    Arthur’s use of his culinary awards to advertise the VivoCity Stall,
                    Arthur claimed in his AEIC that he had had TCS’s “general
                    consent” to use the said awards. He stated in his AEIC at paras 69, 71,
                    73, 74 and 81 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69 At the same time when passing me the original
                        certificates, my uncle did not see the point about keeping them as he said
                        that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“die already also cannot bring along”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71 He was of the opinion that his sons (being disinterested
                        in his noodle business) could not care less about the certificates. He
                        wanted me to have them because he knew I treasured them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73 …. He told me to put them to good use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74 He said that if they were used, at least these
                        certificates and awards could keep him alive in the memory of the general
                        public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81 I understood from this discussion with my uncle that I may use the
                        certificates to develop the family’s pork noodle business so that it
                        does not die out after him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As the issue of consent had been outlined in
                    Arthur’s AEIC and ventilated at the trial, to allow Arthur to amend his
                    pleadings to include the issue of consent would have enabled the real issues
                    between the parties to be tried without causing any injustice or injury to TCS
                    which could not be compensated by costs. As the ends of justice would have been
                    served by allowing the proposed amendments, I allowed Arthur’s application
                    and awarded costs to TCS.</p>
