</div> The AR considered that the base sum should exclude service and conservancy charges, because the licence which the Plaintiff had pleaded was the right to stay in the Flat. The AR also noted that no evidence had been adduced regarding the value of the furniture in the Flat when it was sold. He did not incorporate a sum to reflect the cost of hiring furniture into the base sum. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, in respect of the multiplier, the AR considered that an award for seven years would satisfy the equity which had arisen. The AR noted that, on the Plaintiff’s own evidence, he had only cared for the Deceased and the Aunt for three years. The AR did not accept the Plaintiff’s contention that he should be awarded rent for 168 months, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 14 years, on the basis that he was likely to obtain a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat under the singles scheme around the time that he turns 39 years old. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Additionally, the AR considered the following factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Flat was sold for $385,000 (according to the Plaintiff);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Plaintiff, the Deceased and the Aunt were family; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Plaintiff had benefited by staying in the Flat at the material time and using the utilities for which he had (allegedly) paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The AR further ordered costs to the Plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed on the District Court scale.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Before me, the Plaintiff did not dispute the AR’s approach of identifying a base sum and multiplying that sum for a time period.

</div> This stated that the median rent of a five-room HDB flat in Hougang (the Flat was a five-room flat in Hougang) in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $2,400. The Plaintiff emphasised that, while the rent which he had paid since leaving the Flat was less than $2,400, this was only because he had entered into tenancies for smaller flats. Initially, he had rented a three-room flat from 7 September 2014 to 6 September 2016 for a monthly rent of $2,000 ($1,000 for the premises; $500 for furniture, fittings and fixtures; and $500 for monthly service and conservancy charges). From 7 September 2016, he had rented a four-room flat for a monthly rent of $1,800 (see [10(a)] above).    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, in terms of the multiplier, the Plaintiff maintained that a quantum between 10 and 14 years should have been applied, on the basis that he would likely have to incur rental expenses until he was about 39 years old. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Plaintiff also argued that the AR had erred in principle in accounting for the fact that the Plaintiff had enjoyed rent-free accommodation while living with the Deceased, on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Southwell v Blackburn</span> [2014] EWCA Civ 1347 (“<span class="font-italic">Southwell</span>”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 It is settled law that, in an appeal to a judge in chambers against an assistant registrar’s decision on an assessment of damages, the judge exercises confirmatory rather than appellate jurisdiction. The judge may decide the matter afresh, albeit that due weight should be given to the decision below: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David</span> [2013] 4 SLR 718 at [16] and [46(a)].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Shiok Kim Seng (trading as IKO Precision Toolings) and another appeal</span> [2013] 2 SLR 279 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San</span>”), the Court of Appeal (“the CA”) set out the governing principles for assessing equitable compensation, in relation to a claim in proprietary estoppel, at [42] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Upon the equity arising, <span class="font-italic">its value and how it should be satisfied are matters for the court’s discretion</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) In exercising this discretion, <span class="font-italic">the court should have regard to all the circumstances, including the expectation upon which the plaintiff has acted and the specific detriment he has suffered</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In fashioning the remedy the court must ensure <span class="font-italic">proportionality between the expectation, the detriment and the remedy</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The Court must recall that its task is to satisfy the equity that it considers has arisen. <span class="font-italic">It follows that the strength of the equity will be a relevant consideration</span>. This is another way of looking at the “maximum extent of the equity” which the remedy must satisfy. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) The Court should also be mindful of the great flexibility it has at its disposal in fashioning the appropriate remedy. It may give effect to the parties’ expectations (common or otherwise); <span class="font-italic">or it may limit the remedy to maintain an element of proportionality, or because it considers that the equity has been satisfied by enjoyment or even exhausted.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Subject to the above, <span class="font-italic">the court’s aim, having identified the maximum extent of the equity, is to do the minimum required to satisfy it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Further, the CA identified, at [31], two broad approaches to the exercise of assessing the equitable compensation payable to the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  First, the reliance-based approach which “looks to what the plaintiff’s position would have been had the defendant not made the relevant representations or had the plaintiff not acted upon them”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the expectation-based approach which “looks to what the plaintiff’s position would have been had the defendant actually acted in accordance with the representations”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Jennings v Rice</span> [2003] 1 P &amp; CR 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Jennings</span>”), which was cited by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [38]), Robert Walker LJ (as he then was) made the following observations which are pertinent to this case at [50]–[51]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[50] To recapitulate: <span class="font-italic">there is a category of case in which the benefactor and the claimant have reached a mutual understanding</span> which is in reasonably clear terms but does not amount to a contract. I have already referred to <span class="font-italic">the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor's house, either outright or for life. In such a case the court's natural response is to fulfil the claimant's expectations. But if the claimant's expectations are uncertain, or extravagant, or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered, the court can and should recognise that the claimant's equity should be satisfied in another (and generally more limited) way. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[51] <span class="font-italic">But that does not mean that the court should in such a case abandon expectations completely,</span> and look to the detriment suffered by the claimant as defining the appropriate measure of relief. Indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify, in financial terms, than the claimant's expectations. Detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person's house, and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity … But the detriment of an ever increasing burden of care for an elderly person, and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes, is very difficult to quantify in money terms. Moreover the claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor's assurances, and <span class="font-italic">may receive some countervailing benefits (such as free bed and board). In such circumstances the court has to exercise a wide judgmental discretion.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I gleaned the following principles from these authorities:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the plaintiff has formed an expectation, based on a mutual understanding with the benefactor, of coming into the latter’s home, it may be appropriate to adopt the expectation-based approach.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the expectation-based approach does not require the court to give complete or direct effect to the relevant expectation. A fundamental consideration is proportionality between the expectation, the detriment and the remedy. The aim is to award the remedy which does the minimum necessary to satisfy the equity which has arisen.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Here, the Plaintiff had formed the expectation that he would be allowed to live in the Flat for as long as he wished (see [8]–[9] above). In this light, I decided to adopt the expectation-based approach (see [17(b)] and [19(a)] above). To this end, while there may be different methods of giving effect to the expectation-based approach, I considered that the structured method which the AR had used – multiplying a base rental sum by a multiplier reflecting a time period, to derive the cost of residing in a flat for a certain period – was sensible and appropriate. I also noted that the Plaintiff did not dispute the AR’s methodology (see [13] above). I thus adopted the AR’s structured method and considered, on that basis, the Plaintiff’s arguments that the multiplicand and the multiplier were too low. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In respect of the multiplicand, it was clear from the AR’s reasoning that he did not incorporate a sum for furniture, fittings and fixtures into the base sum (see [10(a)] above). I accepted the Plaintiff’s argument that the AR had erred in this regard. On the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, for which he had obtained judgment, the Deceased had told the Plaintiff that she would be leaving everything in the Flat to him upon her death.

</div>
</div> Thus, the Plaintiff’s expectation was of living in a furnished flat. In that light, applying the expectation-based approach, the AR should have assigned a value to furnishings and incorporated it into the base sum. In my judgment, such an approach was necessary, even though there was no evidence as to the value of the furniture in the Flat when it was sold (see [10(a)] above), because it was plain that the Flat had been furnished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In terms of the quantum of the multiplicand, however, I did not give much weight to the rental sum stated in the Clipping for two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Clipping stated the median rent for flats in a very specific time period, the fourth quarter of 2014. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Plaintiff was content to submit that the multiplicand should be $1,500 per month, reflecting rent of $1,000 and $500 for the furniture, fixtures and fitting, in view of the $500 charged for furnishings in the two tenancies which he had entered into (see [10(a)] and [13(a)] above).

</div>
</div> The Plaintiff did not contend, and quite correctly in my view, that a sum reflecting monthly service and conservancy charges should be incorporated into the base sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I therefore identified the base sum as $1,500.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In respect of the multiplier, I did not accept the Plaintiff’s submission that the figure should be selected by reference to when the Plaintiff was likely to obtain a HDB flat under the singles scheme. In my judgment, applying a multiplicand of 10–14 years, as the Plaintiff suggested (see [13(b)] above), would have led to a remedy which was disproportionate to the detriment which the Plaintiff had suffered, a point to which I return below. The AR had taken the view, in the light of the fact that the Plaintiff had cared for his grandmother for about three years, that the appropriate multiplier was seven years. I agreed with the AR in selecting a multiplier of seven years, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 84 months. Thus, applying the multiplier to the multiplicand, I arrived at a final sum of $126,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, on the facts of this case, I considered that this final sum needed to be moderated in view of the strength of the equity and the nature of the detriment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The strength of the equity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, in terms of the strength of the equity, a relevant factor is the extent to which the equity has been (partly) satisfied: see <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San</span> at [42(e)] and [55(a)]. I agreed with the AR that the fact that the Plaintiff had been staying in the Flat at the material time, rent-free, was a benefit which I should account for. This is because the Plaintiff acquired the benefit of rent-free accommodation as a result of his conduct of living in the Flat to take care of the Deceased, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the conduct by which he satisfied the reliance element of his claim in proprietary estoppel. It is settled law that a benefit which a plaintiff acquires, due to the conduct by which he or she satisfies the reliance element of a proprietary estoppel claim, must be accounted for in selecting the appropriate remedy: see Ben McFarlane, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Proprietary Estoppel</span> (Oxford University Press, 2014) at paras 4.113–4.120 and 4.125. The following authorities establish this proposition:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Jennings</span>, Walker LJ noted, in a passage quoted at [18] above, that the court should account for “countervailing benefits (such as free bed and board)” in fashioning the appropriate remedy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Campbell v Griffin and others</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 990 (“<span class="font-italic">Campbell</span>”), the plaintiff had lived as a lodger with two persons, who later passed away, since 1978. He had taken devoted care of them for at least three years, from 1990 (at the latest) until January 1994, in reliance on their promises that he would have a home for life as a lodger. The plaintiff stopped paying rent in mid-1992 and became the sole occupant of the home in January 1994. In deciding the remedy, Walker LJ accounted for the fact that, at the time of the appeal, the plaintiff had not paid rent for nearly ten years, and had been the sole occupant of a large house since January 1994: see <span class="font-italic">Campbell</span> at [32].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Powell and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Benney</span> [2007] EWCA Civ 1283, the plaintiffs had enjoyed rent-free use of the deceased’s property. The trial judge accounted for this benefit in determining the appropriate remedy for their claim in proprietary estoppel. On appeal, the plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that the judge had erred in doing so. Sir Peter Gibson, delivering the Court of Appeal’s judgment, stoutly rejected this proposition at [30] by opining that “it would offend common sense to leave out of account a benefit received in connection with a detriment … for the purpose of proprietary estoppel”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">Southwell</span> as authority for the contrary proposition (see [14] above). In <span class="font-italic">Southwell</span>, the respondent had been living in a rented house in which she had invested about £15,000. Upon meeting the appellant, and on the basis of an expectation that she would have a home for life, she gave up her home and spent about £5,000 on a new home with the appellant. Thereafter, their relationship broke down and the respondent sued the appellant in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, proprietary estoppel. The Plaintiff relied on the following passages, at [16] and [18], to submit that the AR had erred in accounting for the benefit of his having lived in the Flat rent-free:

I struggled to see how the benefit of rent-free accommodation was not a direct result of the respondent’s reliance on the appellant’s promise, since it was precisely her reliance on that promise that had led her to set up a home with the appellant. Furthermore, it seemed that rent-free housing had only been “inherent and intrinsic” in her decision to rely on the promise because she had contemplated it to be a direct result of such reliance. In my view, the result in <span class="font-italic">Southwell </span>can best be justified in the light of the following passages in that case which suggest a different way of rationalising the decision:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[14] The judge <span class="font-italic">rightly recognised</span>, at para [26], that an exercise of this sort <span class="font-italic">inevitably required him to have regard to the benefits which had accrued to the respondent as a consequence of the relationship</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[15] The benefits that accrued to the respondent during the course of the relationship included rent-free accommodation for herself and for her two daughters and the assistance she received enabling her successfully to complete a three year degree course which enhanced her earning ability. <span class="font-italic">The benefits did not however all flow in one direction. </span>Whilst the appellant and respondent lived together, in effect as husband and wife, <span class="font-italic">the appellant too was assisted and supported by the respondent in the successful pursuit of his career in which he achieved at least one significant promotion over the course of the relationship. His earnings increased accordingly, as will have his acquisition of pension entitlement, a benefit about which the judge had no evidence but in respect of which he was prepared to make an educated assumption. The house in which the respondent was living and in respect of which she no doubt shouldered the major housekeeping activities, albeit she made no financial contribution, increased in </span><span class="font-italic">value from £240,000 to £320,000</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[18] It is true that the judge's conclusions on this aspect of the case were economically expressed. <span class="font-italic">But I think that the judge was wise not to be drawn into an exercise of attempted evaluation of the benefits which, as he rightly observed, flowed both ways.</span> Mr Wynne acknowledged that there is in a case such as this a range of activities and mutual support which is simply incapable of financial quantification. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These passages suggest that <span class="font-italic">Southwell</span> is best understood not as establishing a rule that rent-free accommodation should be excluded from the determination of the appropriate remedy in a proprietary estoppel claim, but on the basis that, on the facts of that case, there was no need to further reduce the remedy in the light of the rent-free accommodation which the respondent had received, because this was already “set off” against the benefits, tangible and intangible, which the respondent had conferred on the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I therefore considered that the fact that the Plaintiff had been staying in the Flat at the material time, rent-free, was a benefit which I should account for in determining the appropriate remedy. I agreed with the AR that, since the Plaintiff had been enjoying rent-free accommodation while he took care of the Deceased, the strength of the equity here was accordingly weakened. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The nature of the detriment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Moreover, the final sum awarded to the Plaintiff had to be moderated to ensure that the remedy was proportionate to the detriment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, while the Plaintiff submitted during the hearing that he had spent $80,000 on expenses for his grandmother, I noted that his pleaded case in the statement of claim was that he had spent a far lower total sum, $18,350.50.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Secondly, the evidence that he had expended this lower sum was not of the highest quality. In the statement of claim, the Plaintiff provided a table relating to his expenditure for and on behalf of the deceased. The table had three columns. One column described the expenses, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “Rental and utility”; another stated the period within which receipts were available to evidence the expenditure; and a final column indicated the approximate total expenditure in respect of each category of expenses. However, some of the approximate total sums were hard to square with the amounts evidenced by the receipts. For example, the Plaintiff adduced receipts indicating that he had spent $274 on ambulance transport for the Deceased’s hospital visits.

</div> But he averred that he had spent a total of $1,000, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, close to four times the evidenced amount, on such transport.

I also made a consequential order for monies that had been paid into court by the Estate, in the sum of $62,089.03, to be paid out to the Plaintiff. I was not minded to disturb the AR’s cost order, and affirmed it accordingly.

The delay was very short (one working day), and was attributable to an oversight by counsel.
