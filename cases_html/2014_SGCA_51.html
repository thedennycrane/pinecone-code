<p class="Judg-Author">
        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the
judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is a criminal reference that arises from a decision by the judge (“the
Judge”) in <em>Leng Kah Poh v Public Prosecutor</em> [2013]
4 SLR 878 (“the Judgment”). Pursuant to the application, the Public
Prosecutor (“PP”) has referred two questions of law of public interest
to this court which relate to the interpretation of s 6(<em>a</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
(Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”). This issue of interpretation arose
as a result of the atypical factual matrix of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
respondent in this reference (“the Respondent”) was the food and beverage
manager at IKANO Pte Ltd, a Singapore company that operates the
IKEA furniture stores in Singapore (“IKEA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       AT35
Services (“AT35”) was a sole proprietorship registered by Andrew
Tee Fook Boon (“Andrew”). Initially, AT35 was a waste management
company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime
in October, Andrew was approached by Gary Lim Kim Seng (“Gary”)
to convert AT35 into a food supply business. Later in the same month,
Andrew met Gary and the Respondent in a coffee shop in the Bishan
area and a plan was hatched to supply food to IKEA through AT35. Gary
and Andrew each contributed $30,000 in cash to start AT35’s new food
supply business but the Respondent made no direct cash contribution. Andrew
was the primary manager of AT35. Later, when the value of AT35’s sales
to IKEA Singapore increased, Gary and Andrew decided to set up Food
Royal Trading (“FRT”), which was intended as a means to reduce the tax
burden on the sales made to IKEA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       AT35
and FRT became the exclusive suppliers of chicken wings and dried
food products to IKEA. The two entities had no other business or clients
besides IKEA. The <em>modus operandi</em> of
AT35 and FRT was as follows: they obtained food supplies from a
food supplier with instructions for that supplier (Tenderfresh,
in AT35’s case) to package its products in unmarked clear plastic
bags and sold them to IKEA at a marked up rate. AT35 and FRT did
not add value to the products: they merely transported the products
straight from its supplier to IKEA. Where storage of the products was
necessary, AT35 stored the products in rented cold rooms in Jurong and
Defu industrial estates. AT35 did not have any cold rooms or storage facilities
of its own. AT35 and FRT were effectively special purpose vehicles to
carry out a scheme which allowed Gary and Andrew to skim money off the
top of food contracts with IKEA and share it with the Respondent.
Over a period of seven years, AT35 and FRT made a profit of $6.9m
and the Respondent was given a one-third share of it, <em>ie</em>, $2.3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Respondent was charged with 80 counts of corruptly accepting gratification
under s 6(<em>a</em>) of the PCA. The first
charge is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, … are charged that you, on or about
the 24th day of January 2003, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit,
a Manager in the employ of IKANO Pte Ltd, did corruptly obtain for
yourself a gratification of a sum of about $14,125 (Fourteen Thousand
One Hundred and Twenty-five Dollars) from one [Gary] Lim Kim Seng,
as a reward for showing favour in relation to your principal’s affairs,
to wit, by being partial in placing orders for food products with
AT35 Services and Food Royale Trading, and you have thereby committed
an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act, Chapter 241.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other charges were similarly framed but pertained to different
amounts of gratification the Respondent received over the course
of the seven years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At
a trial before a district judge, the Respondent was convicted on
all 80 charges and was sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment per charge.
The district judge ordered seven out of the 80 sentences of imprisonment
to run consecutively for a total sentence of 98 weeks’ imprisonment.
The Respondent appealed against conviction and sentence, and on
appeal, the Judge reversed the district judge’s finding that the
PP had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Judge allowed
the appeal, and accordingly acquitted the appellant of the charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
reversing the district judge’s decision, the Judge did not disturb
the former’s findings in relation to the Respondent’s role in the
arrangements with AT35 and FRT to supply goods to IKEA. What was
of concern to the Judge were the district judge’s findings in relation
to the corrupt element of the transaction and the Respondent’s corrupt
intent or guilty knowledge (at [6] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
Judge’s decision centred on the interpretation of s 6(<em>a</em>) of the PCA (“s 6(<em>a</em>)”)
as to whether there was in fact any inducement of the agent (<em>ie</em>, the Respondent) by a third party (<em>ie</em>, AT35 and FRT). His starting premise
was that under s 6(<em>a</em>), there had
to be at least three parties for a corrupt transaction to take place:
first, there must be a principal whose loss is at issue; second,
an agent of the principal whose corrupt intention is in issue; and
third, the third party, who induced the agent to act dishonestly
or unfaithfully in relation to his principal’s affairs. In relation
to s 6(<em>a</em>), the Judge was of the
view that it was not sufficient that a person convicted under that
provision was dishonest: there <em>must be an inducement</em> on
the part of the third party to the agent, for the agent <em>to act in a certain way</em>, that is, the
third party must seek “to prevail on, make, cause, encourage (the agent
to do something)” (see [8] of the Judgment). Therefore, an agent
who has acted with dishonest intent and has interfered with the
affairs of his principal, but <em>has not been
induced</em> to do so by a third party may be guilty of some
other crime of dishonesty, but would not be guilty of corruption
as defined under the PCA. If, and as in fact was the case, the nature
of the arrangements which the Respondent made with AT35 and FRT
were such that the Respondent was the master mind, or a co-conspirator,
then it can hardly be said that the Respondent had been induced
or bribed to do the allegedly corrupt acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
district judge found that Andrew had not explicitly stated the reason
why the Respondent was paid huge sums of money by AT35 and FRT.
Andrew had denied, at trial, the existence of a legitimate reason
to pay the Respondent, and from this the district judge drew the
inference that the Respondent was paid for the illegitimate reason
of showing favour and allowing the arrangement with IKEA to continue.
On the other hand, the Judge found that Andrew was not the master
mind of the scheme and came to partake in the scheme late. Andrew
did not understand the full relationship between Gary and the Respondent
either. This explained why Andrew could not state the reason why
the Respondent was paid huge sums of money (at [11] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
Judge disagreed with the district judge’s inference that there was a
corrupt element to the arrangement between Gary and the Respondent where
the latter would be paid in order for AT35 to be given “business”
by IKEA. The circumstances showed that the agreement for AT35 and
FRT to be given “business” by IKEA was initiated by the Respondent
or by both the Respondent and Gary (at [12] of the Judgment). Given
the following considerations, the Judge found it unlikely that Gary
hatched the scheme himself. First, the Respondent had discussed
splitting profits “from day 1” with Gary. Second, Andrew was merely
a participant who came into the picture late when the scheme had
already been formed. Third, the scheme was an elaborate one which
involved the use of special purpose vehicles and profiteering from
contracts with IKEA, with the Respondent keeping his distance from
the vehicles used to carry out the scheme. Fourth, the Respondent
was also crucial as an insider that enabled the scheme to be implemented.
In truth, it was likely that Gary and the Respondent had “landed
on the idea together” and used AT35 (and later also FRT) as vehicles
for the scheme to be carried out. The Judge thus found that the district
judge’s finding that the Respondent was not involved in the original scheme
but was being induced to participate was, at best, “ambiguous”.
In his words, there was “a reasonable chance” that the Respondent
was effectively paying himself in a profit-sharing scheme where
he received a third of the profit and which also indicated some
element of equal ownership over the scheme (at [13] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
the result, the Judge found that the Prosecution had not proven beyond
a reasonable doubt that there were three separate parties and that the
Respondent was being induced as IKEA’s agent by a third party to
act in a particular way in relation to his principal’s affairs.
The Judge held that the district judge was wrong in finding that
there was a corrupt element in the Respondent being induced to participate
in the arrangement rather than coming up with the arrangement himself
(at [13] of the Judgment). Instead, the Judge viewed the entire
arrangement as one where the Respondent had come up with the idea
of making use of his position within the principal in order to earn
secret profits which he would share with the partners he intended
to bring in to carry out the scheme. The profits from AT35 and FRT
were not rewards given to him as a form of gratification, but rather secret
benefits he had made from the scheme he had hatched; the profits made
by the Respondent were not unlike those made in the situation where a
director acted in conflict with the interest of his company and
obtained a secret profit for himself and thereby giving rise to
a civil claim by the company against him (at [14] of the Judgment).
Therefore, the appellant was not induced by another party to carry
out the alleged acts against his principal. As that element of the
charge had not been made out, the Judge acquitted the Respondent
of the charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The criminal reference</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After
the Judge gave his decision, the PP filed a criminal reference on 16
October 2013 pursuant to s 397 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) to refer two questions of law of public
interest for the opinion of this court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     For
the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where an agent initiated, master
minded or co-conspired in the payment of a gratification to himself,
does this <em>ipso facto</em> mean that he
was not induced or rewarded in respect of his principal’s affairs?
(“Question 1”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     For
the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where an agent used his position
(<em>vis-à-vis</em>, his principal) to create
an arrangement for the payment of a gratification that conflicts
with the interests of his principal, does this <em>ipso
facto</em> mean that the agent was not, by such arrangement,
induced or rewarded for showing favours in respect of his principal’s
affairs? (“Question 2”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     While
Mr S K Kumar did not contest the propriety of the PP’s invocation
of s 397 for a criminal reference, for completeness we will nevertheless
consider it. We first turn to examine briefly the recent precedents
discussing this area of the law. According to <em>Public
Prosecutor v Goldring Timothy Nicholas and others</em> [2014]
1 SLR 586, the prosecution can refer any question that it wishes
to refer to the Court of Appeal without having to obtain leave to
do so. However, this only leapfrogs the leave stage and not the
substantive stage where the Court of Appeal can still consider whether
the case before it falls within the scope of s 397. In the subsequent case
of <em>Public Prosecutor v Li Weiming and others</em> [2014]
2 SLR 393, this court reiterated that it would be well within its
jurisdiction and powers to consider whether the requirements in
s 397 were satisfied before deciding whether the court should answer
the substantive questions posed to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The
four requirements were stated in <em>Mohammad Faizal
bin Sabtu and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter</em> [2013]
2 SLR 141 at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
reference must be made in relation to a criminal matter decided
by the High Court in the exercise of its appellate or revisionary
jurisdiction (“Requirement 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
reference must relate to questions of law and those questions of
law must be questions of public interest (“Requirement 2”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
question of law must have arisen from the case that was before the
High Court (“Requirement 3”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
determination of the question of law by the High Court must have
affected the outcome of the case (“Requirement 4”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We
are of the view that Requirement 1 is fulfilled as the case was
the Respondent’s appeal against his conviction and sentence, and
so the Judge was exercising his appellate jurisdiction when hearing
the case. Requirement 2 was also fulfilled as the questions of law
related to the interpretation of s 6(<em>a</em>)
and as mentioned by this court in the recent judgment of <em>Public Prosecutor v Teo Chu Ha @ Henry Teo</em> [2014]
SGCA 45 at [35], there is great public interest in ensuring that
the principles of law relating to corruption, a huge social evil,
are correctly and authoritatively decided for future cases. The
principles of law will be delineated later when the questions are
addressed. In respect of Requirement 3, Question 1 relates to whether
inducement by a third party need be established in considering the
objective corrupt element of the transaction, and hence the roles
of the agent and the third party in the conception of the transactions
are called into question. Question 2 relates to the Judge’s finding
that the payment of “secret profits” could not amount to a “gratification”
for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>) and raises
legal questions in circumstances where the agent has a beneficial
or legal interest in the third party. We are of the view that Requirement
3 was fulfilled as the questions related to the Judge’s interpretation
of s 6(<em>a</em>) as well as the essential
elements of a charge of corruption. As for Requirement 4, in the
light of the foregoing, it was undoubtedly fulfilled. The Judge’s
interpretation of s 6(<em>a</em>) and his application
to the facts before him caused him to overturn the decision of the
district judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before
considering the two questions of law of public interest that has been
posed to us, we will address the PP’s attempt in its submissions
to re-characterise the two questions as three distinct questions
for us to consider. While s 397 of the CPC may allow for the prosecution
to refer questions of law of public interest to this court without
having to obtain leave to do so, we do not think that this gives
the prosecution the ability to submit new or revised questions of
law to the court by way of submissions. The proper procedure would
have been to refer these new questions to this court for our consideration.
Therefore, we do not regard the three questions as stated in the
submissions as the criminal reference for our present purposes,
and will confine our analysis to the two questions initially referred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Influence and the paradigm of
corruption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While
the PP had referred the two questions of law of public interest in
relation to s 6 of the PCA, the charges preferred against the Respondent were
brought under s 6(<em>a</em>), so our discussion
will be limited only to the latter provision. We thus begin our
analysis by considering the offence of corruption under s 6(<em>a</em>), which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6</b>.    If —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    any agent corruptly accepts
or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any
person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as
an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having
done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs
or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour
to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">he shall be guilty of an offence and shall
be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For clarity, we will refer to “gratification as an inducement
or reward” as the “gift”, and the “doing or forbearing to do … any
act”, “or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour”
to any person in relation to the agent’s “principal’s affairs or
business” would be treated as the conferment of a dishonest advantage
or benefit by the agent on the third party. The use of these words
and phrases <em>are not to be treated as definitions</em> for
the provision or relate to the definitions found in s 2 of the PCA,
but are meant to be convenient terms to encapsulate concepts in
this judgment without utilising the same phraseology as used in
the provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
definition of “corrupt” was considered for the first time in <em>Chan Wing Seng v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997]
1 SLR(R) 721 (“<em>Chan Wing Seng</em>”)
by Yong Pung How CJ in the following manner (at [26]–[27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    I
have been very hesitant to define what “corrupt” means because the factual
permutations of corruption can be endless. Any definition may thus unnecessarily
circumscribe the effect of the section. However, as a starting point,
it is useful to keep in view the natural and ordinary meaning of
the word “corrupt” as a working guide. In this regard, one of the
meanings of “corrupt” as given in <em>The New Shorter
Oxford Dictionary</em> (1993 Ed) is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully;
bribe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And, in further ascribing a meaning to
“corruption”, it states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Perversion of a person’s integrity in the
performance of (especially official or public) duty or work by bribery
etc.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    The
above is probably already what most laypersons understand by corruption.
However, I stress once again that this is no more than a preliminary
guide to what “corrupt” means and is clearly not definitive or exhaustive.
Each case must still be examined on its own facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While attempting to define “corrupt”, Yong CJ was also careful
in emphasising that the word should not be construed only in that
one manner and that his remarks were not intended to be exhaustive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
elements of an offence under s 6(<em>a</em>)
(where the agent has already obtained the gift) are set out in <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
2 SLR(R) 211 (“<em>Peter Kwang</em>”) at
[32] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Acceptance
of gratification.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     As
an inducement or reward (for the conferment of a benefit).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     There
was an objective corrupt element in the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
recipient accepted the gratification with guilty knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first element is the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> of the offence. The other three pertain
to the <em>mens rea</em> of the recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     
          <em>Chan Wing Seng</em> is instructive in the application
of these elements. In that case, Yong CJ held that the fourth element
of guilty knowledge refers to whether the accused knew or realised
that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard,
and is a subjective test (at [23]). On the other hand, the third
element of whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective
inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the
reasonable man and the question is to be answered only after the
court has found or inferred what the accused intended when he entered
into the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With
regards the second element of corruption under s 6(<em>a</em>),
this is normally part of the same factual enquiry as the third element,
as stated in <em>Chan Wing Seng</em> and <em>Yuen Chun Yii v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997]
2 SLR(R) 209 (“<em>Yuen Chun Yii</em>”) and
as recently followed in <em>Tey </em><em>Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor</em> [2014] 2
SLR 1189 (“<em>Tey </em><em>Tsun
Hang</em>”). As stated by Woo Bih Li J in <em>Tey </em><em>Tsun Hang</em> at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the second and third elements
[as stated in <em>Peter Kwang</em>] are conceptually
different, they are part of the same factual enquiry. <em>The question is whether the recipient received the
gratification believing that it was given to him as a quid pro quo
for conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation
to his principal’s affairs.</em> The court has treated these
two elements together in its assessment of whether an offence is
made out. Thus, <em>the causal, or consequential,
link between the gratification and the act of favour alleged to be
procured</em> was examined … <em>under the
rubric of an objective corrupt element</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Keeping
these elements in mind, we consider the paradigm of corruption under
s 6(<em>a</em>). As pointed out in the passages
from Tan Boon Gin, <em>The Law of Corruption in
Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2007) (“<em>The Law
of Corruption</em>”), and by the Judge at [8] of the Judgment,
the starting premise for the paradigm in s 6(<em>a</em>)
is that it involves at least three parties for a transaction to
be corrupt: the principal, the agent, and the person who gives the
gift (henceforth referred to as “the third party”). The purpose
of the third party in giving the agent the gift is to cause the
agent to act in the third party’s interest, and against the interest
of the principal, in breach of the agent’s duty (<em>The
Law of Corruption</em> at paras 3.4–3.5). <em>The
Law of Corruption</em> proceeds to explain that this paradigm
of corruption could be found in s 6 of the PCA (at para 3.5):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where the intent behind the transaction
is to cause an agent to act against his principal’s interest in
breach of the duty he owes to his principal, this taints the transaction
with an objectively corrupt element for the purposes of s 6 of the
PCA. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Taking
the cases and authorities cited above together, the paradigm of corruption
under s 6(<em>a</em>) brings to fore the
characterisation of the gift as being intrinsically tied to the
third party’s intention of giving the gift for the purpose of obtaining
a benefit conferred by the agent at the expense of the principal’s
interest. In the prosecution of the agent under s 6(<em>a</em>),
the intention of the third party would inform the presence of an
objective corrupt element in the transaction and the agent’s subjective
guilty knowledge. The third party’s intention, or ulterior motive,
is to be considered not only from the third party’s point of view
but also from the agent’s (see <em>Chan Wing Seng</em> at
[41] in relation to the third party; and <em>Yuen Chun
Yii</em> at [93] in relation to the agent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     From
the perspective of the agent, the reason why an agent’s actions can
be considered as being corrupt in a transaction is because the nature
of the gift or a promise of it is such that it seeks to <em>influence</em> the agent to act improperly, <em>ie</em>, for the benefit of that third party
who gave the gift or the promise of it, at the expense of the principal’s
interests. This is the objective corrupt element of the transaction.
Where the agent recognises the gift or the promise of it as having
such a connection to the conferment of an advantage upon the third
party and then goes on to act against the interests of the principal
for the benefit of the third party, he would have done so because
he had been <em>influenced</em> by the gift
or the promise of it from the third party. This is the agent’s subjective
guilty knowledge. Together, they form the agent’s <em>mens
rea</em> in a corruption offence under s 6(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In
each case, it must be established that there is, first, a <em>quid pro quo</em> between the gift received
or promised and the dishonest benefit or gain conferred against
the principal’s interests and, second, that the agent perceives
this to be so. The agent’s recognition that his actions were objectively
corrupt, his subjective knowledge, is crucial because <em>the agent must recognise that the gift is meant to
act as an improper influence on his actions</em>. If the agent
receives a gift but does not perceive it to be somehow linked to
or intended to influence his actions <em>vis-à-vis</em> his
principal, but does end up benefitting the third party, it would
be difficult to see how that gift would have affected the agent’s
relationship with the principal, and any benefit conferred upon
the third party would be unrelated to the agent’s performance of
his duties to the principal. <em>Yuen Chun Yii</em> provides
a negative example where the gift was not an influence on the agent.
Yong CJ noted (at [97]) that the $5,000 received by the agent did
not affect the performance of the agent’s duties in relation to
the principal, and the agent’s actions for the third party were
done with the due expedition he would normally have done in performing
his duties <em>vis-à-vis</em> his principal. There
was also no ulterior motive in the receipt of the $5,000 that could
be said to be a gratification that was an “inducement or reward”
and was therefore not caught by the PCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Woo
J had raised in <em>Tey </em><em>Tsun
Hang</em> the possibility of the fourth element of subjective
knowledge causing arbitrary results (at [325]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Allowing the recipient’s subjective knowledge
to come into play could lead to arbitrary results. For example,
a recipient who is a police officer who genuinely believes that
it is acceptable to receive a sum of money from a suspect because
the recipient comes from a society that believes that this is lawful
conduct may validly claim that the fourth element is not made out.
I doubt that this is the law in Singapore but I will say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We have some reservations with regard to these obiter remarks
by Woo J. Where the recipient police officer believes that it is
lawful conduct to receive money from a suspect, the real issue at
hand is still whether that money from the suspect affected the policeman’s
duties <em>vis-à-vis</em> his principal,
and in the conferment of a dishonest benefit or advantage upon the
suspect. It is not so much the belief in the lawfulness of the conduct. Ultimately,
it is the influence the gift has on the policeman and his discharge
of his duties <em>vis-à-vis</em> his principal
that matters. The policeman may very well recognise that it is lawful
to receive money, but that should not be the end of the inquiry;
the court should go further to determine whether the money did in
fact improperly influence his actions in a manner that conflicted
with his principal’s interests and that the policeman recognised
this influence the money would have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We
find support for such an analysis from the English understanding of
corruption. The offence of corruption in the form of s 6(<em>a</em>) has its roots in the common law offence
of bribery. “Bribery” was defined in J W Cecil Turner, <em>Russell on Crime</em> (Stevens &amp; Sons,
1964, 12th Ed) at p 381 as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the receiving or offering [of] any undue
reward by or to any person whatsoever, in a public office, in order
to influence his behaviour in office, and incline him to act contrary
to the known rules of honesty and integrity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this definition, the objective of the third party with
the gift is <em>to influence behaviour</em>,
and allow for an agent to <em>form an inclination</em> to
act contrary to his principal’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The
English statutory offence of corruption was created in three statutes
that were collectively known as the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889
to 1916 (<em>per</em> Prevention of Corruption
Act 1916 (c 64) (UK), s 4(1)), and were targeted at offences within
public bodies. Section 6(<em>a</em>) is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with
s 1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 (c 34) (UK). Section
1(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any agent corruptly accepts or obtains,
or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for
himself or for any other person, any gift or consideration as an
inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having
after the passing of this Act done or forborne to do, any act in relation
to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing
to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s
affairs or business;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… he shall be guilty [of an offence] …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, the word “corruptly” appeared in the Prevention of
Corruption Acts 1889 to 1916 but was not defined therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Subsequently,
the Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life, chaired
by the Rt Hon Lord Salmon from 1974 to 1976 (hereinafter referred
to as “the Salmon Commission”), recommended that the Prevention
of Corruption Acts 1989 to 1916 be consolidated and amended. In
its report, the Salmon Commission analysed the offence of corruption
as containing three main ingredients (at para 51):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     That
a gift or consideration was given or offered by one party to another;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
the gift or consideration was given, or received, as an inducement
or reward for services to be rendered or already rendered in relation
to official duties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     That
the transaction took place corruptly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In relation to the second and third ingredients, the Salmon
Commission considered them as involving the <em>mens
rea</em> of the corrupt act (at para 53):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The prosecution have to establish a particular
intention on the part of the person giving or receiving a gift –
namely that matters relevant to the affairs of a third party (the
public body or principal) should be <em>improperly influenced</em>.
It is an offence corruptly to accept a gift offered as an inducement even
if the recipient has no intention of letting the gift influence
his conduct: <em>it is the recipient’s perception
of the gift as an intended inducement that counts</em>. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this statement, there is a refinement of the definition
of “bribery”, and especially so in relation to the establishment
of <em>mens rea</em> in a corrupt act: <em>it is the influence that the received gift would
have on the agent and his conduct that matters</em>, and the
use of the word “inducement” seems to be synonymous with an improper
influence which the gift would exert on the agent. While the offence
was delineated, the definition of “corruptly” was left out on the
basis that a statutory definition would fail to capture a corrupt
intent in all cases. The Salmon Commission’s conclusion was that the
“law should continue to rely on the ordinary English word ‘corruptly’
to speak for itself” (at para 56).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We
note that the elements which Yong CJ had enumerated in <em>Peter Kwang</em> (see [20] above) bear a close
similarity to the three main ingredients that the Salmon Commission
identified. Additionally, the reservations that Yong CJ had in defining
“corrupt” and “corruptly” (see <em>Chan Wing Seng</em> at [26]–[27])
are similarly alluded to in the report by the Salmon Commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Twenty
years on, the Law Commission published a consultation paper, <em>Legislating the Criminal Code: Corruption (Consultation
Paper)</em>, [1997] EWLC C145 (15 January 1997) followed by
the Law Commission Report in 1998, <em>Legislating
the Criminal Code: Corruption</em>, LCR 1998, Law Com No 248
(“the 1998 Report”) in an attempt to codify the law as it stood. The
Law Commission similarly stated the essential character of corruption as
that set out above at [23]. In the reports, the Law Commission was
of the view that the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 1916
concerned itself not with the breach of duty by the agent but with
the influence which the gift had on an agent’s performance of his
or her functions as an agent (at para 5.73). The 1998 Report took
the position that the law of corruption, as it stood, was meant
to protect the agency relationship of trust and loyalty which is
broken by the tempting of the third party; the agent has an obligation
as the person entrusted to act in the best interests of the principal who
has entrusted him or her (at paras 5.22–5.23). The <em>real
criminality of the agent’s conduct</em> lies in the fact that
the agent has allowed his or her <em>judgment to
be influenced</em> by a gift or future hope of obtaining one <em>and thereby performs his or her functions corruptly</em> (at
paras 5.54 and 5.109).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Based
on the approach of the Law Commission, it is evident that the corrupt
act performed by the agent must be a cause or consequence to the gift
he obtains or hopes to obtain, and this is very much the same as
the <em>quid pro quo</em> nature of the gift
that Woo J had highlighted in <em>Tey </em><em>Tsun Hang</em>. Moreover, in considering the
elements of an objective corrupt element to the transaction and
the agent’s subjective knowledge, the focus of the enquiry of the
agent’s intention is not so much on the act of inducement by a third
party or the actual receipt of the gift but, more importantly, on
the <em>influence</em> that the gift from
the third party has on the agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     From
the discussion of the various reports above, it is clear that the cornerstone
of the s 6(<em>a</em>) offence is that the
agent has been influenced or tempted by the gift given or promised
by a third party and proceeds to or intends to perform his acts
corruptly, and it is <em>that</em> influence
which the law of corruption aims to criminalise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This
makes sense when we consider that there is neither a need for any
gift to have actually passed hands, nor a need to find that the
fidelity of the agent’s duty has actually been breached before an
objective corrupt element is established. In most cases, the breach
of duty would have occurred, but it is foreseeable that in some
instances, there is a possibility that an agent can be prosecuted
for corruption when the breach of duty has not yet occurred. For
example, where the agent asks for a gift and promises to confer
a benefit or advantage upon the third party which is against the interests
of the principal and is apprehended before he actually acts, such
a situation would still be caught by s 6(<em>a</em>)
as seen from the permutation that the offence of corruption is established
when an agent attempts to obtain a gift for “forbearing to show
favour” to the third party in relation to his principal’s affairs
or business. The broad scope of s 6(<em>a</em>)
is meant to protect the fidelity of the agent/principal relationship
which through the gift (or a promise of it) the third party intends
to subvert and this is an underlying theme found in the case law
(see <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Abdul Gofar</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 23
at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     From
our discussion of the case law and interpretation of s 6(<em>a</em>), it is plainly obvious that under s
6(<em>a</em>), the gift, or a promise of
it, must come hand in hand with the third party. It is conceptually
flawed to say that an agent can influence himself to act contrary
to the principal by giving a gift to himself. There is also the
question of whom the benefit has been conferred upon if there is
no third party on whom such a conferment can be made. Without a
third party present, s 6(<em>a</em>) is not
engaged. The provision requires that the agent receives the gift
or a promise of it “from any person” which in the paradigm is the
third party. However, the mere presence of a third party alone would
not suffice; it must play the role as the giver of the gift or the
promisor of the gift to the agent and who has the intention of using
the gift to obtain a benefit for himself – this much is also encapsulated within
the words of the provision itself where the agent obtains the gift <em>from</em> the third party <em>for</em> the
conferment of the benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Therefore,
having regard to the paradigm as stated above, it must be kept in
mind that in considering what constitutes an objective corrupt element
and the subjective guilty knowledge of an agent, it is crucial to establish
that the gift from that third party (given or promised) exerted
an <em>influence</em> over the agent such
that he would act corruptly by conferring a dishonest benefit or
advantage upon the third party and at the expense of the interests
of his principal, and the agent recognises that influence to be so.
The focus of s 6(<em>a</em>) thus remains
on the possibility of the weakening of the agent/principal relationship
given this external influence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     With
this understanding, we will now consider the two questions referred
to us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Question
1 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where
an agent initiated, master minded or co-conspired in the payment
of a gratification to himself, does this <em>ipso facto</em> mean
that he was not induced or rewarded in respect of his principal’s affairs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
question pertains to whether an agent could be “induced or rewarded”
in respect of his principal’s affairs where the idea of receiving
a gratification from the third party did not come from the third
party but from the agent himself. The focus of the question is on
the roles of the agent and the third party in the conception of
the transactions and whether they matter to establishing a “gratification”
for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     According
to the Judge, the agent in this case was the master mind or co-conspirator,
and that he had conceived of the plan with Gary. If so, he could
not be said to have been induced to act in the way he did by a third party.
To the Judge, the role of the agent mattered to the question of whether
the third party could be said to have induced the agent into acting the
way that he did. If it could not be found that the agent had been
induced to act in that manner, the dishonest intent of the agent
and the objective corrupt element of the transaction could not be
established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acts of inducement and “gratification
as an inducement”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It
seems to us that the Judge, as well as the PP, conflated the idea
of inducement as an <em>act of persuasion</em> with
“inducement” as a <em>descriptor of a “gratification”
within s 6(</em>a<em>)</em>. In the
Judgment, inducement for the agent to act in the way he did by the
third party requires the third party “to prevail on, make, cause,
encourage (to do something)”. We do not disagree with such a definition
of an act of inducement. On the other hand, “inducement” is used
in s 6(<em>a</em>) as constituting “gratification”
and must be read in that manner. The phrase in the provision is
“any gratification <em>as an</em> inducement or
reward” [emphasis added]. What acts as the inducement or a reward <em>is</em> the gratification (and which we have
referred to above as “the gift”). This way of considering the elements
of corruption was accepted in <em>Peter Kwang</em> (see
above at [20]) as well as by the Salmon Commission (at para 51):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… that the gift or consideration was given,
or received, as an <b>inducement</b> or <b>reward</b> for services to be rendered or
already rendered … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Establishing
the gratification as an inducement or reward is only part of the
factual enquiry. It must be linked as the cause or consequence of
the conferment of the benefit upon the third party as an analysis
under the rubric of an objective corrupt element (see above at [25]).
Thus, the correct approach is to ask the question: was there a gratification <em>by</em> inducement or reward to the agent <em>that</em> led to a dishonest or improper gain
or advantage being conferred by the agent on the third party? This
retains the importance of establishing the influence the gift has
on the agent and its relation to his acts of conferring the benefit
upon the third party and at the expense of the interests of his
principal (see above at [37]). The inquiry in relation to an “inducement”
in the context of s 6(<em>a</em>) is <em>not</em> about the presence of an act of inducement
by the third party. As a matter of principle, whether an objective
corrupt element exists, and which is related to a finding of a “gratification”, <em>cannot</em> be dependent on who initiated the promise
of a gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     If
the finding of an act of inducement by the third party is always necessary
to establishing a “gratification”, then s 6(<em>a</em>)
would be rendered potentially ineffective in certain scenarios and
lead to absurd outcomes. Should the agent be the first in time in
asking for the gift <em>eg</em>, because
the agent had conceived of the intended transaction and had asked
for the gift, he would not be considered corrupt as he was not influenced
by the third party who agrees with his suggestion to give the gift,
and does not make the offer in the first place. This would also
mean that the more outrageously an agent behaves in soliciting for
the gift the less likely he would be guilty of the offence of corruption.
If “inducement” is interpreted to mean the act of the third party
in persuading the agent, then such scenarios will not fall within
s 6(<em>a</em>). That is not only an unsatisfactory
outcome but also undermines the entire object of PCA. Indeed, common
sense would suggest that an agent who solicits a “gratification”
is equally, if not more culpable than one who responds positively
to receiving a “gratification” by the third party. In addition,
two vital words in s 6(<em>a</em>) – “accepts”
or “obtains” – clearly point to the passive or active role which
the agent could have played in receiving the “gratification” from
the third party. This was not considered by the Judge. In our opinion,
the initiation of the transaction by a third party does not necessarily
have to be found as a fact in all cases in order to establish “gratification”
under s 6(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The
case law has also shown that an active procurement of a gift by the
agent would also be evidence of “gratification”. In <em>Tan
Tze </em><em>Chye v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 357,
the offender was the managing director of a company in the business
of property consultancy. He was instructed to sell an industrial
property and was also to secure the printing of publicity brochures
to promote the sale of the property. The offender approached one
Ang from Akira Advertising Pte Ltd to do the printing, and asked
Ang for a 10% commission. Ang agreed and made the payment out to a
sole proprietorship managed and run by the offender which was recorded as
consultancy services. The offender was charged and convicted with accepting
$383 as a reward for showing favour to Ang by engaging Akira Advertising
Pte Ltd to do the printing of the brochures. In <em>Wong
Teck Long v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 488 (“<em>Wong Teck Long</em>”), the offender who was
a manager of private banking in a Singapore branch of an international
bank was approached by a borrower to arrange for a quick loan of
RM100m. The accused suggested to the borrower to open more accounts
in the name of other high-net-worth individuals thereby circumventing
the need to comply with the required approval procedure for a large
loan. The offender colluded with the borrower in submitting false
information on the net worth of individuals and the loan was approved.
Pursuant to hints to the borrower, the offender obtained a sum between
RM300,000 and 400,000 as a reward for the help he rendered to the borrower
and was convicted under s 6(<em>a</em>).
In <em>Pandiyan </em><em>Thanaraju
Rogers v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 217, one Manjit
Singh who needed assurances and wanted to be kept apprised of the
details of his assault case approached the accused who was a police
officer. The accused constantly assured Manjit and made representations
to the effect that he could assist Manjit with police matters. The
accused later asked for a sum of $2,000 from Manjit, and Manjit
agreed to it. The accused was charged and convicted for accepting
a sum of $2,000 as an inducement. In the above cases, the third
party’s act of inducement of the agent could not have arisen on
the facts as it was the agent who had first asked or hinted at a gratification
to be made. Section 6(<em>a</em>) of the
PCA therefore allows for a breadth of factual matrices where either
party, <em>ie</em>, the agent <em>or</em> the third party, can initiate the procurement
of a gift for a benefit to be conferred when establishing the objective
corrupt element of the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We
recognise, and as also correctly noted by the Judge, where an agent
plays an equal or greater role in creating the corrupt scheme, it cannot
be said that he was persuaded or induced by another to join in the scheme.
Saying so would be to understate and, indeed, even distort the agent’s
actual role. That said, and given our foregoing analysis, it is incorrect
to determine “gratification” based on the act of inducement of the agent
by the third party as that is not the basis of inquiry when considering whether
an objective corrupt element exists. Instead, the focus should be
on the nature of the gift and the influence it has on the agent
and his subsequent actions, which as we mentioned above is key to
establishing the objective corrupt element of the transaction and
the agent’s subjective guilty knowledge. With respect, we hold that
the Judge had erred in defining “inducement” in the context of s
6(<em>a</em>) in the way that he did, and find
that the fact that an agent had not been induced by the third party
into entering the scheme is not fatal to establishing the “gratification”
in the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However,
we should add that this is <em>not</em> to
say that the initiation of a scheme is not relevant to the inquiry.
Active solicitation or acts of inducement by a third party would
go towards establishing the circumstances before or after the gratification
is given and would go some way to show that the agent believed that
the gratification that was promised or given to him was so that
an advantage would be conferred upon the third party or another
and thereby show that the agent was influenced by the receipt of
the gratification or promise of it. To that extent, where it was
the third party who initiated the scheme, the third party’s role
as the initiator will be an important fact to consider, and would
also go to establishing the objective corrupt element of the transaction
and the agent’s guilty knowledge. Of course, evidence that the third
party was not corrupt in making the gift (<em>eg</em>,
because he meant it as a <em>bona fide</em> gift
without an expectation of a dishonest gain or advantage) would also
be relevant in establishing what the intention or ulterior motive
behind the giving or promise of the gratification was (see <em>Chan Wing Seng</em> at [37] and [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
conclusion, we answer Question 1 in the <em>negative</em>.
We are of the view that it is not necessary in every case of establishing
the “gratification” of the transaction that it must be proven, as
a fact, that there was an act of inducement by the third party upon
the agent. Such a finding may not arise in all cases and will be
largely dependent on the facts before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Question
2 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of s 6 of the PCA, where
an agent used his position (<em>vis-à-vis</em> his
principal) to create an arrangement for the payment of a gratification
that conflicts with the interests of his principal, does this <em>ipso facto</em> mean that the agent was not,
by such arrangement, induced or rewarded for showing favours in
respect of his principal’s affairs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On
the face of it, Question 2 seems to raise very much the same query as
Question 1. However, in the light of the views of the Judge and
the PP’s submissions, we have taken it to have raised the query
whether, in a situation where the agent has some beneficial or legal
interest in the third party, the agent’s drawing of his share of
the profits obtained by that third party from the benefits conferred
could be considered a “gratification” for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     According
to the Judgment, the money that was received by the Respondent should
be considered as secret profits which he shared with his partners
and such profits could not amount to a “gratification” for the purposes
of s 6(<em>a</em>). The crux of the Judge’s
reasoning is that the benefits which the Respondent conferred on
AT35 and FRT were effectively secret profits which the Respondent
had created for himself using AT35 and FRT as business entities.
The Judge was of the view that the agent was effectively benefitting
himself which meant that there was no third party upon whom the
agent was conferring a benefit – the party that the agent was conferring a
benefit upon included, or was, himself, as there was some evidence
of equal ownership in the two entities by Andrew, Gary and the Respondent (see
[13]–[14] of the Judgment). In other words, when the Respondent drew
his entitlement from the profits obtained by the two entities (his
one-third share), that was his share of the secret profits and could
not be considered as “gratification”. He was withdrawing what was
his as he had a beneficial ownership in the third party (<em>ie</em>, the two entities). The Judge’s analysis
thus proceeded on the basis that because of this, it could not amount
to a corrupt transaction. In other words, you could not give a gratification
to yourself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Two
related issues arise from the Judge’s findings: (i) where a benefit is
conferred upon an entity in which an agent has a beneficial interest,
could such an entity be the third party for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>); and (ii) whether the agent receiving
his share of the profit made from the benefit conferred upon the
entity would constitute “gratification” for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>). As these two issues are closely connected,
we will consider them together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We
also note, cursorily, that while what are loosely termed as “secret profits”
may be the subject of an actionable civil wrong, that does not preclude
it from being relied upon as evidence of an objective corrupt element.
Nothing in the PCA provides that civil wrongs cannot also be a criminal
wrong. Prosecution of cases such as the present do not amount to the
“broadening [of] the scope of the offence of corruption” as the
PCA can capture civil wrongs in the appropriate cases (see [14]
of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interest in a third party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The
starting premise is – what should the court be concerned about when
the agent has some form of a beneficial or legal interest in the
third party which is conferred the benefit?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In
this regard, we would make the following observations. It must be borne
in mind that persons who have a shareholding, legal and/or beneficial
ownership or interest in a legal entity are not synonymous with that
legal entity, and the two must be treated as distinct. We do not
see why the separate legal entity doctrine should not otherwise
apply in the context of s 6(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In
this case, the vehicles used to confer the benefits were two business entities
(AT35 and FRT), which were not incorporated companies. However,
we do not think that that should matter as the two business entities
were no less separate entities from the people who owned them. Following
the doctrine of separate legal entity, some form of ownership in
a legal entity does not preclude it from being considered a third
party for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>).
On that premise, an agent’s ownership in the entity does not alter
the fact that it is a separate legal entity and is a third party
distinct from the agent and his principal. The position of the agent
in the entity would be like any other person who has a beneficial
or legal ownership in the entity. Thus, the mere fact that the agent
is a legal and/or beneficial owner of the third party does not mean
that the requirement for there to be an agent, principal, and third
party under s 6(<em>a</em>) cannot be satisfied.
We would hasten to add that there may be situations in which, due
to the fact that the agent owns the third party, that the lines
between the agent and the third party may be blurred. For example,
where the third party is a sole proprietorship with the agent being
the proprietor or the third party is an incorporated company with
the agent being the sole shareholder. In such circumstances, arguably
the agent and the third party could be considered (looking at the
substance) to be the same or identical. Such a situation does not
arise in the present case and there is thus no need for us to make
a definite ruling on the PCA’s proscription for such situations.
Accordingly we say no more and leave it for another day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Where
the three parties are established, and s 6(<em>a</em>)
is engaged, whether the secret profits received by the agent would
be considered a “gratification” would be dependent on the same factual
inquiry of an objective corrupt element that we posited earlier
(at [43]): was there a gratification <em>by</em> inducement
or reward to the agent <em>that</em> led
to a dishonest gain or advantage being conferred by the agent on
the third party?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     So,
the court will balance the fact that the agent had an entitlement
to the profits made by the beneficially owned legal entities with
the other facts which might otherwise show that an objective corrupt
element is still present. Some relevant, but non-exhaustive, factors
would be: the workings of the scheme; how the secret profits were
derived; the setting up of the third party; the duration and purpose
of the third party; fair competition against other entities for
contracts with the principal; fair competition against the principal
for contracts by other parties; and the agent’s actions <em>vis-à-vis</em>, the principal and the third
party in making the profit. Depending on the facts of the case,
the scheme may be considered as having an objectively corrupt element
despite the agent’s beneficial interest in the monies received by
the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It
would thus be incorrect to assume that simply because the agent
has a part ownership in the third party and the agent has obtained
his share of the profits from it that the agent could not be said
to have obtained that share of the profits as a “gratification”.
An inquiry into all the circumstances of the case is called for.
The Judge had erred in thinking that because the Respondent had
some beneficial ownership in the third party (AT35 and FRT) and
had merely obtained his share of the profits of AT35 and FRT that
a corrupt transaction could not thereby take place. The beneficial
ownership and the agent’s share of the profits obtained are only part
of the picture, and a proper inquiry must be made into the true
nature of the arrangements between the agent and the third party.
Otherwise, it would be all too simple for an agent to devise inventive
and sophisticated schemes related to skimming secret profits off
the principal in order to escape the sanction of s 6(<em>a</em>). An agent who seeks to obtain a gift
under the guise of a cleverly devised scheme may very well find
himself guilty of corruption as the court will not hesitate to look
beyond the pretext or the guise and determine the presence of an
objective corrupt element in the transaction and the true nature
of the arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Therefore,
our answer to Question 2 is in the <em>negative</em>.
Where the agent has a beneficial interest or ownership in a legal
entity, this does not mean that the entity is not a separate legal
entity and is not a third party for the purposes of s 6(<em>a</em>). In determining whether so-called secret
profits received by the agent are a “gratification”, the court will
take into consideration the agent’s beneficial interest in the profits,
but this is not determinative. The court must consider all the facts
surrounding the transaction to see if an objective corrupt element
is present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Given
our analysis and for the reasons above, we have arrived at the conclusion
that both the questions referred to this court, and which relate to
s 6(<em>a</em>), must be answered in the <em>negative</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Under
s 397(5) of the CPC, this court may make such orders as the High
Court might have made as this court considers just for the disposal
of the case. In light of our answers to the questions raised in
this criminal reference, parties are to address us on the appropriate
orders that this court should make in relation to the decision of
the Judge.</p>
