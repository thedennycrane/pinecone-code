In 2017, Enjin changed strategy and focused instead on developing a proprietary blockchain technology for software developers. Their technology allowed software developers to integrate digital tokens within their games, applications and other programs. Enjin began issuing a digital token called “ENJ Coin” (“ENJ”) which was based on the Ethereum network.

</div> ENJ is a utility token that can be used to create digital assets. There is a fixed amount of ENJ because there is no way to create new ENJ. Therefore, using ENJ to create digital assets gives the asset scarcity and value. In late 2017, through an Initial Coin Offering (“ICO”), Enjin created 1bn ENJ and sold around 700m ENJ to the public to raise capital.

Nor were these proceedings where a married person was being prosecuted for a crime committed against the other. Thus, all communications between Ms Pritchard and Mr Blagov during the period of their marriage between 29 January 2004 and 15 November 2019 were protected by the privilege.

Here, the party invoking the privilege was Enjin, rather than Mr Blagov. In response, Enjin's counsel indicated that he had firm instructions from Mr Blagov to commence an application on his behalf should that be necessary. Thus, I decided that it was simpler and more convenient to proceed as if such an application had been made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Origins of the provision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Section 124 of the EA was based on s 122 of the Indian Evidence Act (Act No 1 of 1872) which was enacted in Singapore <span class="font-italic">vide</span> the Evidence Ordinance (No 3 of 1893). At the time, the statutory position in England with regard to privilege between spouses was contained in the Evidence Amendment Act 1853 (“EAA 1853”). There were two key aspects to the EAA 1853:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Individuals were <span class="font-italic">competent and compellable</span> to give evidence in civil proceedings involving their spouses. Section 1 provided that husbands and wives of parties were to be admissible witnesses, meaning that they were competent and compellable to give evidence in a trial involving their spouse. This provision was enacted to displace the prevailing rule to the contrary (see <span class="font-italic">Rumping v Director of Public Prosecutions </span>[1964] AC 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Rumping</span>”) at pp 856–858). However, this new rule did not apply to criminal proceedings by virtue of s 2 of the EAA 1853.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Individuals were <span class="font-italic">not compellable</span> in any proceedings to disclose communications made to them by their spouse, pursuant to s 3 of the EAA 1853. While witnesses were entitled to refuse to disclose martial communications, they could do so if they wished (<span class="font-italic">Rumping</span> at p 858). Further, this privilege only extended to communications made <span class="font-italic">to</span>, rather than <span class="font-italic">by</span>, the individual (<span class="font-italic">Rumping </span>at p 859).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It is worth noting that the <span class="font-italic">prohibitory</span> aspect of s 124 EA, that no spouse shall disclose marital communications without the consent of the other spouse, (which is relevant here) was not present in the EAA 1853.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Singapore case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 There is limited case law on s 124 EA.

The AR did not agree with this proposition for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Based on the historical background of the legislature in England and India relating to marital communications privilege the AR concluded that the doctrine of marital communications privilege was rooted in the public interest in the protection of marriages and the preservation of domestic harmony: <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [23]. The privilege promoted absolute frankness and candour in marital communications, and avoided unhappiness that might arise if one spouse were to reveal marital communications without the other’s permission. For the privilege to be effective in doing so, it had to apply to <span class="font-italic">all </span>marital communications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 EQ Capital relied on some American cases to make the argument that there was a “business transaction exception” to marital communications privilege. The AR dismissed this argument because the American statute that was interpreted in those cases referred to “<span class="font-italic">confidential</span> communications” between spouses.  In contrast, s 124 of the EA referred to “<span class="font-italic">any</span> communications” between spouses. There was therefore no room to read such an exception into s 124 EA: <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [28]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 EQ Capital then argued that in fact, s 124 EA only applied to “<span class="font-italic">confidential</span> communications”. It cited John Henry Wigmore, <span class="font-italic">A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law: Including the Statutes and Judicial Decisions of all Jurisdictions of the United States and Canada</span> (Little Brown, 2nd Ed, 1923) (“<span class="font-italic">Wigmore</span>”) which opined that because “the essence of [marital communications] privilege is to protect <span class="font-italic">confidences</span>” [emphasis added], only communications that are intended to be private would be protected (at §2336). The AR did not agree for three reasons. First, the use of the word “<span class="font-italic">any</span>” in s 124 EA could not be ignored. Any interpretation of s 124 EA which read a limitation into the statute would be contrary to its clear words: <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [30]. Secondly, the marital communications privilege was meant to protect the <span class="font-italic">relationship</span> of confidence between spouses, rather than specific communications between them. Thus, it would not be consistent with the object of the statute expressed in its legislative history to protect some communications between spouses, but not others: <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [31]. Finally, there would be considerable difficulties with applying any test to determine which communications between spouses were confidential and which were not. The “but for” test suggested by EQ Capital would be impossible to apply – the fact that parties are married affects in some way all aspects of all communications between them, so determining what would have been said between them regardless of their relationship would be pure guesswork: <span class="font-italic">EQ Capital </span>at [32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Thus, the AR concluded (at [34]) that marital communications privilege extended to “<span class="font-italic">all</span> communications, ranging from the most quotidian of daily banalities to the deepest intimacies, and must include matters relating to the ordinary business affairs of the spouses” [emphasis in original]. The AR noted EQ Capital’s final argument – that such a conclusion resulted in the practical absurdity where a family-owned company whose board is made up of spouses was able to resist disclosure of all company communications – but held that some degree of unfairness in litigation accompanied all privileges, and that it was for Parliament to decide where to strike that balance. The existence of s 124 EA in its current form made it clear where this balance had been struck with regard to marital communications privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The AR’s decision was appealed but Chua Lee Ming J dismissed the appeal. Chua J was troubled by the fact that, in that case, communications between two directors regarding the affairs of the company were being protected by marital privilege, but broadly agreed with the AR’s reasons and considered that any reform to s 124 EA (including its repeal) should come from Parliament.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, I did not accept Ms Pritchard’s submission that s 124 EA was limited to communications between spouses that would not have been made but for their marital relationship. For broadly similar reasons to those given by the AR in <span class="font-italic">EQ </span><span class="font-italic">Capital</span>, such an interpretation is untenable on the wording of s 124 EA. When interpreting a statute, the first step that a court must take is to ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock”</span>) at [37]. I do not see Ms Pritchard’s proposed interpretation to be a possible interpretation of s 124 EA, which clearly covers “any communication made to [a spouse] during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married”. Ms Pritchard’s proposed interpretation failed to satisfy the first step set out in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock. </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Nor did I accept Ms Pritchard’s submission that her interpretation should be preferred because the courts can, and do, construe statutes in an ambulatory manner, taking into account new situations which arise and were not within contemplation at the time of the statute’s enactment.

</div>
</div> Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that when s 124 EA was enacted it was not commonplace for husbands and wives to be in business together, it might be said that the injustice resulting from the situation where a spouse was prevented by s 124 EA from adducing relevant evidence in a commercial dispute would have been occasional when the section was enacted but would now be far more common. However, I disagreed with Ms Pritchard’s submission that s 124 EA must be interpreted more narrowly to avoid injustice and to account for this change in societal circumstances. Ms Pritchard cited <span class="font-italic">AAG v Estate of AAH, deceased </span>[2010] 1 SLR 769 (“<span class="font-italic">AAG</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>) at [30], where the Court of Appeal held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> It is a settled principle that a statutory provision should be construed in a manner which will take into account new situations which may arise and which were not within contemplation at the time of its enactment... The court is to apply to an ongoing Act a construction that continuously updates its wording to allow for changes since the Act was initially framed (see Francis Alan Roscoe <span class="font-italic">Bennion, Bennion on Statutory Interpretation – A Code</span> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008) at p 889 (on s 288(2)). A statutory provision should not be regarded as a historical document but a document written with an eye to the indefinite future, ie, that it will be applied not only to facts in existence at the time it came into force but also to conditions and circumstances which may surface in the future (see Ruth Sullivan, <span class="font-italic">Driedger on the Construction of Statutes </span>(Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1994) at p 139).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">AA</span><span class="font-italic">G </span>did not assist Ms Pritchard. There, the court was making the point that the things that words in a statute may encompass may change over time, with changes in technology or social practices. As an illustration, when the drafters of s 124 EA chose the word “communication”, they clearly did not contemplate e-mails. However, given that e-mails are now frequently used by people to convey information to each other, it is clear that the word “communication” in s 124 EA would include them. This is consistent with the first step in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>. Here, Ms Pritchard’s argument was not that any of the words in s 124 EA have broader application now than they did in 1893. She was not suggesting that the meaning of “any” had changed over time. Rather, she was suggesting that the court disregard the meaning of s 124 EA in favour of an interpretation which, in her view, would strike a more desirable balance between competing policy objectives, given present social conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Secondly, I dealt with Ms Prichard’s submission that the s 124 EA exception applied to suits that were, in substance, between married persons, even if on one side or both the spouse sued by corporate vehicle. I was not convinced that this was the case as a matter of law, although it had some cogency. In any event, given that there was a minority shareholder in Enjin, I was not able to accept that this suit was, in substance, between Mr Blagov and Ms Pritchard. The s 124 EA exception for disputes between spouses therefore did not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, I was of the view that communications between spouses only fell within s 124 EA if they were made between them in their capacity as spouses as principals; thus, where a spouse communicated with a spouse on behalf of another person, the section would not apply. In such cases, the communication would be by the spouse's principal, rather than by the spouse. Section 124 EA would not apply because it only applies to communications “by any person to whom [the spouse] is or has been married.” One example of such a case may arise where two spouses work for different companies that do business with each other. If the wife acting for her employer offers to purchase something from the husband’s employer, and conveys this offer to her husband, the conveyance of that offer to her husband is not a marital communication. It is a communication between the spouses’ respective employers that happens to take place via the spouses. Another example arises where two spouses work for, or are officers of, the same company. They may communicate with each other in circumstances where the communication is part of the company's business and forms part of the company's record. Take the case where the two spouses are the only directors of that company. The minute kept by one of them of a board meeting held between them without others present, or a communication between them approving the entry by one of them into a contract with a third party on behalf of the company, would not be protected by marital communications privilege. Those would be records of the company or communications between the company and either spouse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this case, Ms Pritchard was employed by Enjin first as its COO and then as its CFO. Mr Blagov was its CEO and a 67% shareholder. Thus, it would not be surprising that they communicated with each other concerning the terms of Ms Pritchard's employment and her alleged entitlement to ENJ tokens. Mr Blagov's communications with Ms Pritchard about these matters would arguably be made on behalf of Enjin and be understood by Ms Pritchard as such given the usual authority of a CEO – especially one who was also a majority shareholder. In particular, I noted that even on Enjin’s own pleading, Ms Pritchard was authorised to sign contracts on behalf of Mr Blagov so as to bind Enjin.

While 6m ENJ was set aside for her some time in 2017, this sum was merely earmarked for her and would be awarded over time at the sole discretion of Enjin’s directors. This was in accordance with Enjin’s standard procedure for all its staff. After awarding 3m ENJ to Ms Pritchard in March 2019, Enjin’s directors exercised their discretion to award her only 500,000 ENJ in February 2020 in light of her poor work performance.

In relation to bonus, it is common for an employee to be given the right to participate in a bonus scheme. A typical bonus scheme might involve an annual consideration of an employee’s performance and then a declaration of bonus. The court would look to the terms of the bonus scheme to determine the employee’s rights both before and after declaration. In this case however Ms Pritchard’s counsel has specifically disavowed reliance on any right as an employee to participate in the ENJ allocation exercise described in the white paper. Instead, he has put her case on the basis of a standalone oral contract that was formed during the 2017 discussions:

</div> In my view, this reliance is misplaced.<span class="font-italic"> </span>It is of course the case that the formation of bilateral contracts requires an event, a point in time when parties achieve the proverbial meeting of minds.

A plaintiff may recall that a meeting took place at which the contract was formed but not have recorded the date at that time and be unable to remember the date when the matter is litigated. The plaintiff may insist the meeting took place on one date and the defendant another, with no way to tell who is right. Neither situation is fatal to a successful claim. The question is whether the plaintiff has proved that an oral contract was formed at that meeting, notwithstanding that the date of the meeting remains unclear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 At the same time, in evaluating credibility and the balance of probabilities, lack of clarity about dates may well count against the plaintiff.

To my understanding, there were no caveats or conditions attached to the bonus where the amount of bonus could be varied, or additional terms imposed in relation to it. I had rightfully earned the same after years of being part of the management of Enjin and for being instrumental to the success of the ICO.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I would make three comments on this evidence (other than its lack of detail). First, it is phrased as an award of bonus for past performance and contribution, not as a free-standing contract. Secondly, it dates that contribution from 2007, when Enjin was only incorporated in 2012. Thirdly, it dates the award to a time after the ICO succeeded. As the fund raising achieved by the ICO itself, as opposed to presales, occurred in November 2017, this would date it to November or December 2017 at the earliest.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63  Ms Pritchard’s evidence at trial was both more detailed and different in substance.

</div> Ms Pritchard asked him about the ENJ that was hers from Enjin. Mr Blagov checked the ENJ allocation spreadsheet and told her that 6m ENJ had been assigned to her, of which 3m had been sold by Enjin and paid out to her in cash as US$300,000, so that “3m enj remains for u”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As an aside, this was one of the conversations over which Enjin sought to assert Mr Blagov’s marital privilege. It is clear however that just as much as statements made by Mr Blagov on behalf of the company in 2017 concerning the company setting aside for her 6m ENJ were not marital communications, nor was this confirmation in 2019. Before responding to Ms Pritchard and in order to give her the accurate figure, Mr Blagov checked a company document, namely the ENJ allocation spreadsheet. I have no doubt that he intended to communicate to her on behalf of Enjin and that she understood him to be so communicating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Eight months later, on 7 February 2020, and following from Mr Blagov’s confirmation, Ms Pritchard reminded Mr Blagov and Mr Radomski on Slack of the 3m ENJ that remained for her.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I do not accept Mr Blagov’s evidence. First, what was discussed was 6m ENJ and not 3m. Secondly, I do not accept that he expressly tied the tokens to future work performance or used the words “up to” or “earmarked”. This paragraph in his AEIC is a self-serving afterthought. Had he done any of these, then it would have been natural for him to use the words “up to” or “earmarked” rather than simply the word “assigned” when he responded to her in 2019, and also to remind her that it was conditional on work performance. The same point applies to Mr Radomski’s response in February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The question remains, however, whether Mr Blagov’s statement to her, while he and Mr Radomski worked on the ENJ allocation spreadsheet, that she would get 6m ENJ, amounted to an enforceable promise.

All that was said here was that Ms Pritchard would get 6m ENJ, in the context of and with reference to the ENJ allocation spreadsheet, which was itself being worked on to aid the exercise of allocating ENJ to the team contemplated by the white paper. Ms Pritchard has disavowed any incorporation of the terms applicable to team members generally, and asserted that her allocation was final and not subject to any further discretion or variation by Enjin. I am not able to find that her being told that she would get 6m ENJ meant that Enjin was offering them to her on terms different from those applicable to the team generally. Simply put, not enough was said to imply or infer that the offer was for her to receive 6m ENJ regardless of whether she remained in Enjin for any particular period of time, or on any other special terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consideration </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72   Consideration is a requirement for the enforceability of a contract that is not executed under seal.

Something that the promisee has already done prior to the promise being made does not count because it cannot have been given in exchange for the promise. Generally, past consideration is no consideration: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [83]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73  Ms Pritchard’s pleaded case, carried through into her evidence at trial, is that she was awarded a total of 6 m ENJ due to the success of the ICO and in consideration of her efforts and contributions to the business since 2007.

The court must be able to infer this intention from the circumstances in which the promise is made. The intention to create legal relations is an intention that the transaction was to have legal effect, such that if a disagreement arose or the contract was not honoured subsequently, the aggrieved party could invoke the assistance of court: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [71].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The discussions in this case took place in the context of a company and a business. The context of the conversation does not of itself negate an intention to create legal relations. Moreover, there was a degree of informality in how Enjin was run, including the fact that Ms Pritchard’s terms of employment were not reduced into writing. Where there is informality, it cannot be said that the lack of writing itself suggests the absence of an intention to create legal relations. I have also considered the fact that she and Mr Blagov were then husband and wife, which might help to explain both the absence of a written contract of employment and their not feeling the need to put into writing an award of bonus to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 However, I accept Mr Blagov’s and Mr Radomski’s evidence that in substance what was happening was “brainstorming”, with the ENJ allocation spreadsheet being a tool for that. Mr Blagov seems to have spoken casually and without detail. In a way, it would have been a passing comment made naturally in the context of discussions with Mr Radomski while Ms Pritchard was in the room. I therefore find that not only were the terms uncertain, the lack of clarity and absence of detail leads to the inference that Mr Blagov was not intending to create legal relations. I also find that when Ms Pritchard was told by Mr Blagov that she would get 6m ENJ, she could not reasonably have believed that this was meant to establish a legal right such that she could sue Enjin if the number was reduced subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Upon clarification that Ms Pritchard’s case was that there was a standalone or free-standing contract for her to receive 6m ENJ, the requirements for contract formation and enforceability became critical. I am unable to find that any offer was certain as to its terms, supported by consideration or made with an intention to create legal relations. I conclude that Ms Pritchard was not legally entitled to the 6m ENJ prior to its being transferred or its equivalent in money being paid to her. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there an agreement on 22 April 2020 between Mr Blagov and Ms Pritchard to resolve her entitlement to 2.5m ENJ?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Even though Ms Pritchard was not entitled to 2.5m ENJ, she was claiming that she was so entitled in April 2020. If she compromised that claim with Enjin, that compromise agreement would be binding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80  As with the issue of entitlement, Ms Pritchard alleges an oral contract. According to her, as of April 2020, she still wished to continue to work for Enjin. However, on 22 April 2020, while they were speaking over Slack, Mr Blagov told her she did not have to continue working for Enjin and suggested that she leave peacefully, by submitting a formal letter of resignation and then transferring a sum of money equivalent to her remaining entitlement from Enjin’s account to their joint bank account. They would each be entitled to half of this money. In addition, she could also transfer the balance of the ENJ and ETH tokens in the company’s virtual wallet to herself, after which Enjin would write them off. Ms Pritchard says she agreed to this and proceeded to act on their agreement. To her surprise, Mr Blagov immediately reneged on their agreement. In fact, even while proposing this course of action to her, he was acting in bad faith, as he had already cancelled the digital tokens that she held for access to and operation of Enjin’s account with Standard Chartered Bank.

I find it quite implausible that Mr Blagov would have deliberately tricked Ms Pritchard into transferring money out of Enjin with a view to then holding her to account for taking money from Enjin. Having observed him giving evidence, I do not think such behaviour would accord with his character. While he was at times grudging concerning Ms Pritchard’s role in Enjin and was not altogether forthcoming concerning how the 6m ENJ was set aside for her, this does not support in any way the allegation that he, in effect, framed Ms Pritchard for unauthorised withdrawals from Enjin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Ms Pritchard’s account was not supported by the documentary evidence before the court. She was unable to provide any documentary evidence to show that the conversation with Mr Blagov took place on 22 April 2020. At the same time, the documentary evidence that was available only highlighted inconsistencies in her account. In particular, I refer to her email of 24 April 2020 to Mr Radomski.

</div> A waiver by election operates where there is a choice between two inconsistent courses of action. This is illustrated by the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> Lim</span> [2010] 3 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>”), where one party had consigned jewellery to the other. The consignee sold the jewellery without paying any share of the sales proceeds to the consignor. The consignor took steps to claim a share of the proceeds, including by writing letters of demand. He was held to have thereby waived any right to claim in conversion, as he had chosen to treat the consignee’s actions as an authorised sale. There, the claim for conversion was inconsistent with the claim for the sale proceeds: <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock </span>at [31]. In this case, on 22 April 2020, Ms Pritchard did not choose a course of action that was inconsistent with the right she seeks to enforce in this suit. Instead, she then sought to take what she believed was hers by self-help, instead of by a legal suit as she is doing now. In short, she used her authority with Enjin’s bank to pay herself what she believed was due to her rather than commencing a legal suit for the tokens or their equivalent in money. A failed attempt at self-help would not bar a plaintiff from continuing to assert the right in respect of which self-help was attempted.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Ms Pritchard’s counsel did not dispute that if she failed in relation to the two alleged oral contracts she was not entitled to retain the balance of the S$407,000 in her hands, namely S$197,672, nor was she entitled to transfer to herself the ENJ and ETH tokens in Enjin’s virtual wallet. She must repay the sum of S$197,672 together with simple interest at the court rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ originally filed in the District Court until date of judgment. I note that Enjin’s claim is for S$209,304.86, derived from the sum she transferred from the Joint Account to her personal accounts (see [13(d)] above).

However, in its pleadings and in submissions to me, Enjin quantified the value of the 42,000 ENJ and 3.3 ETH in monetary terms, while Ms Pritchard’s counsel agreed in oral submissions that if Enjin succeeded,  the remedy should indeed be payment of money, in either currency that had been pleaded, and that consequently the Injunction should be discharged.

I find that she made these purchases in anticipation of her resignation and would clearly have understood that any implied authority she might have to make such purchases could no longer be relied on without first checking with Enjin. This comes from her duty of good faith and fidelity as an employee to Enjin, which entails not making use of Enjin’s property for her own purposes, and giving due consideration to the interests of Enjin: <span class="font-italic">Piattchanine, Iouri v Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1257 at [242].

While the TransferWise Statement reflects the S$1,078 transaction, the heading under which the transaction appears is “USD balance on 24 April 2020 [GMT]”. Thus, it is possible that some of the transactions reflected therein were refunded or voided after 24 April 2020. In fact, the transaction of S$5,538 which Enjin accepts was ultimately not successful is also reflected in the TransferWise Statement. It is entirely possible that some time between 24 April 2020 and 10 July 2020, Enjin disputed the S$1,078 transaction with TransferWise and TransferWise in turn refused to pay Amazon. I find it unlikely that in such a situation, TransferWise would have withheld the sum from Amazon without returning it to Enjin’s account.
