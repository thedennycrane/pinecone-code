</div>  The minutes of the November 2012 AGM do not record any explanation for the appellants’ proxy’s caution.  Nonetheless, it may be surmised that the appellants and/or the proxy were likely of the view that item (b) required a 90% resolution because it came under s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA (see below at [64]).  Similarly, the appellants and/or the proxy likely considered that item (c) required a special resolution either under s 32 of the BMSMA by virtue of being a by-law relating to common property, or under s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) as it pertained to the removal of structures from common property.  However, in spite of this, the then chairman of the management council indicated that the council had taken legal advice and was content to proceed by way of an ordinary resolution for items (a) to (c) above.

While numerous points of law were raised, I find that they were worded rather clumsily and in a confusing manner.

I found that the points of law in question could be grouped into the following two categories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first point of law is whether the STB erred in not granting the orders sought by the appellants in relation to the removal of the awnings and the restoration of the external walls despite its findings that (a) there was no 90% approval for the SPs of the relevant 14th floor units to carry out such works on the common property of the development, and (b) there was no “killer litter” problem in the development.

</div>  Put another way, the alleged error of law is that the STB, in deciding against ordering the respondent to take steps to restore the common property, took into account the irrelevant consideration that the affected SPs of the 14th floor units ought to have been given a chance to be heard and to raise any possible defences and/or counterclaims against the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In respect of this point of law, the respondent argues that the STB’s decision would stand even if the issue of the affected SPs of the 14th floor had not been considered by the STB.  First, it argues (contrary to its stance before the STB) that the external walls are <span class="font-italic">not</span> common property after all, and there was therefore no need for approval via resolution under s 33 of the BMSMA for the works to be carried out.  Second, even if the external walls are common property, the November 2018 and November 2019 resolutions had provided the necessary approval for the works. I shall deal with these arguments by the respondent in the course of dealing with this point of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The second point of law raised by the appellants is whether the STB had erred in failing to consider a whole host of the appellants’ alternative arguments as to why the structures installed on, and the alterations made to, the common property are illegal and should be ordered to be removed and/or restored.

In the first place, if counsel’s argument is correct, there would have been no necessity to enact s 33(2) giving the management corporation the power to sue in respect of any matter affecting the common property. The subsection contains no limitation as to the type of matters concerning the common property in respect of which the management corporation can sue or be sued or as to the circumstances in which such suits may be brought by or against the management corporation. Secondly, the common property is under the control, management and administration of the management corporation, and it is also the management corporation, rather than the individual subsidiary proprietors, who have the duty to keep it in good and serviceable repair. Thirdly, it is obviously more convenient for the management corporation, operating under well-defined decision-making procedures prescribed by the Act and bye-laws, to take proceedings in respect of any matter concerning the common property, rather than for the subsidiary proprietors as individual subsidiary proprietors to do so. There is no reason for any particular subsidiary proprietors whose property is not specially affected by defects in the common property, to take the initiative of suing. This is of special relevance in a large condominium with many subsidiary proprietors, some of whom might be more affected by the defects than others.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28     I am therefore of the view that it is consistent with the purpose and objective of the Act that, in regard to common property in general, it is the management corporation, rather than the subsidiary proprietors, which should normally be the party to sue and to be sued. Such proceedings are for the account of the management corporation as management corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In sum, it is the MCST that is the statutorily empowered body that manages the common property of the development.  Further, it is clear from the authorities that the MCST is the correct party, in form and substance, to defend a claim that relates to the common property of the development.  The MCST can be sued in respect of common property, and any judgment obtained against them takes effect as a judgment against all the SPs of the development.  The purpose of the statutory provisions is to simplify the procedural aspects of legal proceedings, so that there is no need to name all the SPs of the development as defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my judgment, there was no procedural defect in the proceedings commenced before the STB.  The appellants have taken issue with the installation of fixed awnings on the external walls, and also the demolishing of some external walls of the development, within the balcony areas.  There was no dispute between the appellants and the respondent in the STB proceedings that these external walls of the development are common property.  That being the case, the respondent, being the MCST, is the correct party to be named as the party to defend the STB proceedings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I do not think that it was necessary for the appellants to have named the affected 14th floor units’ SPs as respondents in the proceedings, because there was no dispute that what they had done was to install structures and make alterations to the <span class="font-italic">common property</span> of the development.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 While it certainly is true that the 14th floor SPs would be significantly affected if the respondent is ordered to take steps to remove the structures and to procure the restoration of the external walls, I find that this simply followed from the fact that these SPs had erected illegal structures on the common property, and in some cases, demolished common property.  The STB made the point that the affected 14th floor SPs ought to be heard in their defence.  I agree to the extent that, insofar as they <span class="font-italic">might</span> have some claim against the MCST for having misled them into believing that their additions and alterations were legal and authorised, these affected 14th floor SPs would be entitled to bring claims against the MCST to seek legal recourse.  However, it does not follow that they have a defence, if the MCST is ordered to take steps to remove the illegal structures and/or restore the external walls.  In other words, I do not see how they can successfully resist any order which requires the common property to be restored to its original form.  They cannot insist on keeping their fixed awnings, and their sliding glass doors, since these were constructed on common property without the proper approvals as required under s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA.  The only possible defence is if a particular 14th floor SP can show that he requires his awnings for reasons of safety, for instance if his unit suffers from a “killer litter” problem; this is a point I will deal with in making my orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Thus, I am of the view that the STB erred in not granting the orders sought by the appellants in respect of the common property of the development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In any event, I noted that, in the STB proceedings below, one of the SPs of the 14th floor unit below the appellants gave evidence as a witness for the respondent.  As such, it could not be said that, for at least this SP, he was not heard as to why the fixed awnings that were installed for his unit should not be removed.  His evidence was to the effect that the fixed awnings which covered his balcony should not be removed because of the risk of “killer litter”, and because it prevented the ingress of water into his unit during torrential rain.

As such, even if I am wrong in holding that it was not necessary for each affected SP to be heard in relation to whether the alterations that they made to the common property should be restored, this consideration should not apply to the SPs of the 14th floor unit directly below that of the appellants’ unit, as it is clear that their evidence had been heard and considered by the STB. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Common property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the appeal, the respondent belatedly attempted to argue that the external walls of the development that were within the balcony areas of the 14th floor units were actually <span class="font-italic">not</span> common property, but owned by the individual SPs of the units.  As such, it is argued that there was no requirement for the respondent to procure a 90% resolution under s 33 of the BMSMA (see [64] below) to permit the 14th floor SPs to make alterations to the external walls on a permanent basis.

</div>
</div>
</div>  I accept the submission by the appellants that they will be prejudiced if the court is now to entertain the contention that the external walls might not be common property.  As pointed out by counsel for the appellants, the case could well have proceeded differently below, in that counsel could, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, have attempted to elicit evidence from the respondent’s witnesses as to who was responsible for maintaining and painting the external walls of the development in order to persuade the STB that the external walls are common property.  Such evidence is now not before me because of the concession by the respondent that the external walls are common property.  Also, the appellants might have focused more on their arguments in relation to s 37(4) of the BMSMA, to show that the MCST was wrong in granting the 14th floor SPs permission to make improvements to their lots because the MCST did not consider whether these additions and alterations affected the façade of the development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For these reasons, I reject the respondent’s contention that the external walls of the development are not common property, and find that s 33 of the BMSMA is in fact applicable.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The resolutions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I now turn to the respondent’s other argument as to why the STB’s decision should stand, namely that even if s 33 of the BMSMA were to apply, the November 2018 and November 2019 resolutions sufficed for the purposes of that section to authorise the installation of the awnings and the modification of the walls.  I begin with the November 2019 resolution, as it appears to have carried more weight in the view of the STB.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The November 2019 resolution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The STB suggested that the special resolution, for the creation of a by-law, passed with 89% vote at the November 2019 AGM, might provide the basis of a possible defence by the affected 14th floor SPs, if the respondent were to take action to enforce any order for the removal of the fixed awnings, or to restore the demolished external walls.  It appears to me that this was an additional reason the STB declined to make an order for the removal of the awnings or the restoration of the external walls.  The STB was of the view that the by-law passed by the November 2019 resolution “may well make the disputed awnings etc. to be authorised structures as they stand now.”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I am unable to agree with the views expressed by the STB.  This special resolution passed at the November 2019 AGM was a clear attempt to provide a blanket whitewash approval in respect of <span class="font-italic">all</span> unauthorised structures on the common property of the development.  This is readily apparent from the plain wording of the by-law.  It allows SPs to submit a list of all hitherto unauthorised structures on common property, or all hitherto unauthorised alterations to common property, to the office of the management by 2 January 2020, and once recorded by the management office staff, these structures or alterations would be <span class="font-italic">deemed</span> authorised.

Section 41(8) of the LTSA embodied this by requiring a unanimous resolution for a by-law to confer on an SP exclusive use or special privileges.  While the present s 33(1) of the BMSMA does not go quite so far, the gradated approach it takes, which matches the length of time over which a resolution extends with the threshold required for the passing of that resolution, demonstrates that same implied recognition of other SPs’ rights.  This gradated approach sets out a carefully considered balance between the rights of the SPs as a whole to the use and enjoyment of the common property and the conferring of rights of exclusive use or special privileges over common property to individual SPs, by requiring higher majority approvals for longer periods of exclusive use or special privileges over common property.  To preserve this balancing of rights, the requirements of s 33 must be strictly complied with whenever exclusive use of, or special privileges over, common property in a development is contemplated.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my judgment, it is clear that, under s 33 of the BMSMA, the resolution in question which confers on a SP the exclusive use of, or special privileges over, the common property, must identify the SP in question, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SP of which unit.  It should also specify the period of time over which the exclusive use, or special privilege accorded, should last.  It should obviously also identify clearly the nature of the exclusive use or the special privilege, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the fixture of awnings to shelter the balcony of the particular unit, or permission to demolish the external walls in the balcony of the particular unit.  I find that the November 2019 by-law flouts all these requirements.  It gives <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> to the SPs to submit a list of all the exclusive uses of the common property they wish to enjoy, or special privileges over the common property which they wish to exercise, and allows the management office to effectively grant them to the SPs, who are not even named in the by-law, without further question.  In my view, this is undoubtedly an invalid resolution, insofar as it is one that is passed purportedly to comply with s 33 of the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In addition, as already noted, the by-law does <span class="font-italic">not</span> specify the duration which the exclusive use of, or special privileges over, the common property, whatever they might be, are to last.  According to the respondent, the intent behind the by-law, which was passed after the appellants commenced STB 87/2019, was to authorise the installed fixed awnings, and the demolition of the external walls, for the period of three years, starting from the date of the November 2019 AGM,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Kwang and Ng’s 1st Affidavit at para 34(c): ROP at pp 936–937.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  Counsel for the respondent urges me to accept that the November 2019 by-law is effective in allowing the alterations to the common property to remain in place for this three-year period.  This is in spite of the fact that this three-year period is not even stated in the by-law.  He explains that parties would continue to attempt to resolve the dispute during this period, or perhaps even attempt to pass 90% resolutions to authorise the alterations to the common property which are the subject of these legal proceedings.  While counsel for the respondent assures me that there would be no further attempt to pass yet another special resolution to “authorise” the changes for a further three-year period because s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) would “not allow for such an extension”, he candidly accepts that this restriction on further attempts was not apparent from the wording of the by-law.  I note, however, that the affidavits of the respondent’s representatives were silent as to whether there would be another attempt to pass a special resolution upon or close to the expiry of the initial three-year period, that is, November 2022, to authorise the changes to the common property for another three years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I cannot accept this submission.  First, the structures erected and the changes to common property that are intended to be addressed by the November 2019 by-law, that is, the affixing of the awnings on the external walls, and the demolition of part of external walls, are clearly intended by the relevant 14th floor SPs to be permanent in nature.  There is no doubt that those SPs’ real intent is to keep these changes for more than three years.  In fact, for the 14th floor unit below the appellants’ unit, the fixed awnings have been in place since 2011, without any proper approvals.  Some of the changes to the common property, by which I mean, the demolition of the common walls, are in their very nature clearly intended to be permanent, unless there is a change in ownership of the unit, where the new SPs may wish to reinstate those demolished walls.  All this being the case, it is incumbent for the by-law to be passed pursuant to a 90% resolution.  Following the failure to pass the by-law with a 90% resolution, the fixed awnings and the demolished walls cannot be then simply deemed authorised for a period of three years under s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the BMSMA, without any mention of this under the by-law.  In my view, they are and continue to be unauthorised structures affixed onto common property of the development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Secondly, it would be an improper and illegal use of the procedures set out in s 33(1) of the BMSMA, if one could effectively accord to SPs exclusive use of, or special privileges over, common property <span class="font-italic">indefin</span><span class="font-italic">itely</span> by the passing of <span class="font-italic">special</span>, but not 90%, resolutions, every three years, in cases where the intended use or privilege involves changes to the common property that are permanent in nature.  In my view, this appears to be the true intent of the respondent, whose management council members do not want to face up to the realities of the situation they are presently in, and to accept the fact that the previous management council members might not have carried out their duties in accordance with what is required by the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the above reasons, I find that November 2019 by-law is not legally effective insofar as it purports to authorise the fixed awnings installed by the 14th floor SPs, or the demolition of the external walls of the development.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The November 2018 resolution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 As for the special resolution passed by the SPs in November 2018, I agree with the STB

</div>
</div> that, on its plain wording, it did not deal with the fixed awnings that had been installed by the 14th floor SPs, or the demolition of the external walls of the development.  That special resolution would have, if passed, allowed the management council to approve applications for the “installation of fixed shelter at balcony private enclosed space (PES) area at level 14”.  It is not unambiguously stated in this resolution that it applies to the affixing of awnings on the external walls of the development.  As such, I agree with the STB’s decision that this special resolution did not deal with existing awnings installed by the 14th floor SPs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 However, even if the November 2018 resolution can be read to apply to the awnings installed by the 14th floor SPs at the balconies for their units, it suffers from the same infirmities as the November 2019 resolution, in that it did not specify any SPs, the nature of the exclusive use or the special privilege, or the period of time over which this use or privilege was to last (see above at [66]).  Not only that, insofar as it purports to grant permission for the 14th floor SPs to keep their awnings affixed on common property on a permanent basis, the resolution was not passed by the requisite 90% approval as required by s 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the BMSMA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Alternative arguments not considered by the STB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As mentioned, the appellants also raise in this appeal several points of law which were canvassed before the STB, but not dealt with in its decision.  However, given my view that the STB erred in not granting the orders sought by the appellants because the 14th floor SPs were not parties to the STB proceedings, there is no need for me to consider these alternative arguments.  It suffices for me to say that I am of the view that a number of the points raised by the appellants are not quite sustainable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As an example, the appellants assert that the respondent breached s 37(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the BMSMA by allowing the 14th floor SPs to install the fixed awnings and/or demolish parts of the external walls of the development without considering whether it would detract from the appearance of any of buildings in the development.

</div>  Under s 37(4) of the BMSMA, the respondent may authorise the SP to effect improvements “in or upon his lot” if it is satisfied that the improvements will not detract from the appearance of the building, or are in keeping with the appearance of the rest of the buildings in the development, and also if those improvements will not affect the structural integrity of any of the buildings comprised in the strata title plan in question.  There is no requirement that the SPs vote at a general meeting in favour of the making of such improvements by any requisite majority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present matter, the appellants’ case is that the 14th floor SPs had effected alterations to the common property by affixing the awnings to the external walls and/or by demolishing part of the external walls.  As already mentioned, there was agreement between the parties before the STB that the external walls are common property.

</div>  That being the case, I am of the view that s 37(4) of the BMSMA has no application to the facts, because that section does not apply to the grant of exclusive use or privileges over common property, which is governed by s 33 of the BMSMA.  This was in fact accepted by counsel for the appellants in the course of the oral arguments before me.  Otherwise, an MCST could simply circumvent the requirements for obtaining resolutions set out in s 33 of the BMSMA, by simply considering itself satisfied as to the conditions set out in s 37(4) of the BMSMA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Another example is the appellants’ point regarding estoppel.  According to this argument, the appellants had been misled by the representations by the management council of the respondent made after the November 2012 AGM  that there was a by-law that would require the 14th floor unit’s SP below theirs to remove his awnings if he should sell his unit.

</div>  The appellants relied on these representations and waited for six years only to discover that the representations were false, because the by-law was never acknowledged by the BCA, and thus had no force or effect.  I can appreciate the appellants’ criticisms that have been levelled against the respondent and its management council at that time, and also the frustration that the appellants must feel.  The conduct of the management council was quite poor in this regard.  However, as rightly acknowledged by counsel for the appellants himself at the hearing, these circumstances, while certainly lamentable, do not give rise in law to any cause of action or right to relief against the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the reasons set out in this judgment, I find that the STB erred in not granting the orders sought by the appellants against the respondent for the removal of the fixed awnings and/or the restoration of the demolished external walls.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 At the oral hearing before me, counsel for the respondent submitted that, even if the court were to order the removal of the fixed awnings and/or the restoration of the demolished external walls, the respondent should be given some time to make one final effort to obtain 90% resolutions for these exclusive uses of the common property by the 14th floor units’ SPs.  The respondent also argued that it needed some time to explain the legal impact of any adverse decision to the SPs as a whole, including the resulting claims that may be brought against the respondent by the affected 14th floor SPs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In reply, counsel for the appellants argued that the respondent should at most be given up to a month to remove the awnings and restore the demolished external walls.  Counsel pointed out that the respondent has had more than sufficient opportunities to obtain the required 90% resolutions and each time it was attempted, the 90% approval threshold could not be reached.  In the meantime, since 2011, the appellants have had to endure living with the nuisance caused by the unauthorised awnings just outside their windows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In my judgment, a period of three months would be sufficient time for the respondent to carry out what it needs to do before proceeding to take steps to remove the fixed awnings and restore the demolished external walls.  As such, pursuant to s 98(2) of the BMSMA, I remit this matter to the STB for it to make the necessary orders for the respondent to remove the fixed awnings and restore the demolished external walls if, within a period of three months from the date of this judgment, the necessary 90% resolutions for the installation of the awnings and the demolition of the external walls for each of the affected 14th floor units have not been obtained.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the meantime, the orders made by the STB in relation to s 63 of the BMSMA are stayed for the time being, with liberty to the appellants to apply to the court to lift the stay in the event that a 90% resolution for the installation of the awnings is in fact obtained in respect of the 14th floor unit directly below the appellants’ unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the event that the awnings have to be removed and the external walls restored, I appreciate that the respondent may require the necessary orders from the STB in order to get the 14th floor SPs to comply.  Should that need arise, the respondent should make the necessary applications to the STB.  If an affected 14th floor SP claims that his unit suffers from a “killer litter” problem, and he can raise fresh evidence of this not already dealt with by the STB in the proceedings below, then the STB can decide whether the exception does actually apply to his unit such that the MCST should authorise the maintenance of that SP’s awnings for reasons of safety.  Obviously, this would not apply to the 14th floor SPs below the appellants’ unit given that their claim about “killer litter” had already been rejected by the STB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I will also grant the respondent liberty to apply in the event that more time is needed to comply with this judgment.  However, I must stress that strong cause must be shown before any extension of the three-month deadline will be granted.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I will deal separately with the issue of costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Xiancong (Taylor Vinters Via LLC) for the appellants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Seng Siew and Lip Wei De Eric (OTP Law Corporation) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
