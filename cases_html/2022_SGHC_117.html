While the position has been made clear under s 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (the “IRDA”), as a number of cases remain to be decided under the Companies Act, these remarks are published for the benefit of those in practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applicant seeks orders allowing the liquidator of the applicant to enter into a funding arrangement, under which the benefits or proceeds of claims are assigned and, further or alternatively, a declaration that the funding arrangement does not amount to maintenance or champerty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary points</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 It suffices for me to note in passing that a sealing order was sought and granted. I also accept the applicant’s arguments that the present application is governed by the Companies Act rather than the IRDA, as the date of the resolution of the creditors’ voluntary winding up was passed on 29 October 2019 before the commencement of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether proceeds of a cause of action count as property under s 272</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 It is not argued by the applicant that post-liquidation causes of action vesting in a liquidator are property of the company and hence assignable. The decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 717<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Neo Corp</span>”) controls the issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The applicant argues, though, that the proceeds of causes of action arising in liquidation are property of the company which may be sold by the liquidator under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act. Just as no distinction is drawn between pre and post-bankruptcy assets, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Re Fan Kow Hin</span> [2019] 3 SLR 861 (“<span class="font-italic">Fan Know Hin</span>”)<span class="font-italic">,</span> neither should any be drawn in respect of the corporate insolvency context. The English decision in <span class="font-italic">In re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd</span> [1998] Ch 170 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Oasis</span>”) which ruled that a liquidator could only sell pre-insolvency assets should not be followed. The Singapore Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp </span>only endorsed <span class="font-italic">Re Oasis </span>for the narrow position in law concerning the assignment of causes of actions only, but does not bar the proceeds of post-liquidation causes of actions from being part of the property of the company which may be assigned by the liquidator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 However, as I did in <span class="font-italic">Fan Kow </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span> (at [17]), I do not find that it is open to me to go behind the Court of Appeal’s endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Re Oasis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp</span>. I have considered much the same arguments in <span class="font-italic">Fan Kow Hin</span>. While the applicant has tried to narrow the scope of the endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Re Oasis </span>by <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp</span>, it is not appropriate for me to so distinguish the Court of Appeal’s decision. I find that the scope of the <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp </span>adoption or endorsement is wider than that characterised by the applicant. There was no limitation as argued for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It may be that it would be more rational to not distinguish between the position under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), as determined by <span class="font-italic">Fan Kow Hin</span>, and that under the Companies Act, but that is where we are: avoiding that differentiation is not reason enough for this court to go behind <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp</span>. It was not argued by the applicant that the position under the IRDA shows the clear parliamentary intention to do away with that distinction between the Bankruptcy Act and the Companies Act. But I would have rejected that argument in any event: the fact that Parliament enacted the provision in IRDA does not change the proper interpretation to be given to the Companies Act provision as indicated in <span class="font-italic">Neo</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In fact, the very enactment of s 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA supports the proposition that it was not previously possible to assign the proceeds from post-liquidation causes of action under the Companies Act,<span class="font-italic"> </span>following the principle that “Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain” <span class="font-italic">(Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [38]). This is made clear from the parliamentary debates discussing, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, s 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (1 October 2018) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… These new provisions allow the judicial manager to assign proceeds from such an action to a third party, in exchange for funding of the action. This new avenue of funding may increase the likelihood of such an action being pursued. This will, in turn, benefit stakeholders by providing higher recoveries, if such actions are successful. This new power is similarly provided to liquidators in clauses 144(1)(g) and 177(1)(a).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To avoid doubt, these new provisions are only intended to provide for the assignment of proceeds from such an action brought by the judicial manager or liquidator. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The enactment of s 144(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the IRDA was described as a “new power” provided to liquidators and would introduce a “new avenue of funding”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">No maintenance or champerty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The approach in <span class="font-italic">Re Vanguard Energy Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 4 SLR 597<span class="font-italic"> </span>applies to the present case. I find on what is before me that the funding arrangement does not violate the rule against champerty or maintenance. Those standing behind the arrangement, namely creditors of the company, have an interest in the litigation. The proceedings will be under the control of the liquidator and allowing the arrangement to proceed will ensure access to justice since, otherwise, the company would not be able to investigate and pursue the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 This is sufficient for the applicant to be granted the substance of its application. The court thus grants the declaration sought by the applicant. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew Chan Chee Yin (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) (instructed), Clarence Lun Yaodong, Ang Minghao, Wong Changyan Ernest, Christopher Lim and Chua Qin En (Fervent Chambers LLC) for the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
