</div>  However, I disagree with the first and second defendants that the overlap in issues between OS 1446 and Suit 1048 was “engineered” by the plaintiff’s belated amendments to his pleadings in Suit 1048.

</div> By that time, the 2016 dividend and cheques were already in issue in Suit 1048. In fact, as the first defendant’s counsel observed in oral submissions before me, the 2016 dividend and cheques were an integral part of Suit 1048. The first defendant’s claim in Suit 1048 for monies allegedly owed to her by the plaintiff forms the basis for her assertion that she was entitled to withdraw $4m from the second defendant via the eight cheques. Furthermore, the amount claimed by the first defendant in Suit 1048 was derived after setting off the amounts she had declared under the dividends. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 More importantly, in determining whether it is fair and efficient to order a stay of proceedings, the court must consider <span class="font-italic">all the circumstances of the case</span>. This entails taking a broader view of the situation in order to evaluate the justice of the case as a whole. Taking this approach, I find that the justice of the case lies in staying the proceedings for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 First, the starting point is whether there is a multiplicity of proceedings. This is the “trigger” for the court’s discretion to grant a case management stay (see <span class="font-italic">BNP Parib</span><span class="font-italic">as </span>([10] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35]). Here, it is clear that there are overlapping issues in OS 1446 and Suit 1048. Although the first defendant asserts that OS 1446 concerns the validity of various meetings whereas Suit 1048 involves the repayment of debts,

</div>
</div>
</div> the <span class="font-italic">underlying </span>disputed issues of fact are similar, in particular, the circumstances surrounding the 2016 dividend and cheques. While the second defendant contends that there is no risk of conflicting judgments due to <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>and estoppel, the fact remains that these are issues that are common to both proceedings. The question, therefore, is which proceeding is more appropriate to determine these disputed issues of fact. As I shall elaborate below, the robustness and thoroughness of the trial process in the evaluation of the evidence in Suit 1048 is superior to relying solely on affidavit evidence in OS 1446.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Secondly, I am cognizant of the fact that the overlapping issues involve serious allegations of misconduct, fraud, dishonesty, forgery and the alleged making of a false police report by the plaintiff. If these allegations are found to be proven, there could be serious repercussions for the parties involved. Furthermore, the parties have put forward two diametrically different versions of the events. As such, it is important that these issues be properly ventilated and the parties’ positions tested against the evidence. Yet, to proceed with the hearing of OS 1446 would mean that the court will have to determine these issues without the benefit of cross-examination, the litmus test of the truth, and based on the untested affidavit evidence of the first defendant and her witnesses. In my view, it is unwise and unsafe to embark on such a quick and summary process. In contrast, the parties will have access to much more evidence and will be able to cross-examine all the witnesses as of right in Suit 1048. Given that the same allegations regarding the 2016 dividend and cheques will also be dealt with extensively in Suit 1048, it is more appropriate, just and expedient for these issues to be determined there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Thirdly, the grant of the Stay Application will not unduly prejudice the first and second defendants. The first defendant can still cross-examine the plaintiff in the trial of Suit 1048 and make her case there. Furthermore, I disagree with the first defendant’s submissions that she will be “irreparably prejudiced by a stay as the issues in the counterclaim will remain hanging for years”.

</div> The trial of Suit 1048 is fixed for hearing on 14 January 2021, which is in a few months’ time from now. Furthermore, although there will be some delay to the resolution of OS 1446 pending the determination of Suit 1048, this will have minimal practical effect given that the director, namely, Mr Poon, sought to be appointed via the EGMs and the board of directors’ meetings has already tendered his resignation.

</div> Furthermore, the plaintiff has withdrawn his claim in OS 1446 and there is an existing court order that the plaintiff will not reinstitute the same action in future. The first defendant’s concern that the impugned notices and resolutions will be treated as valid during the period of the stay can be addressed by an order that such validity is suspended pending the determination of Suit 1048, until the counterclaim in OS 1446 is heard. In any case, it is highly undesirable for the court to determine the serious disputed issues based on insufficient and untested evidence albeit it may be due to the plaintiff’s unwillingness to be cross-examined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The second defendant submits that it is prejudiced if the stay is granted as it is not a party to Suit 1048. In OS 1446 the protagonists are the plaintiff and the first defendant. The second defendant is a party to OS 1446 as the case also concerns the proper function and the legal propriety of the board of directors and the EGMs. In Suit 1048 the <span class="font-italic">dramatis personae</span> are the plaintiff and the first defendant in OS 1446, and the second defendant is not a party to Suit 1048 as the disputes do not involve the second defendant. However, the outcome and findings in Suit 1048 will resolve the disputed issues of fact in OS 1446, in particular, the circumstances surrounding the 2016 dividend and cheques. Nevertheless, the second defendant will still have the opportunity to make its case, if any, in OS 1446 upon the conclusion of Suit 1048. Hence, the interests of the second defendant in OS 1446 are also not compromised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For the above reasons, I find that it is both fair and efficient as regards the resolution of the dispute to stay the proceedings in OS 1446, pending the court’s determination of Suit 1048. This is on the condition that the validity of the impugned notices and resolutions is suspended.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether OS 1446 should be converted to a writ action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Since the Conversion Application is an alternative application,

</div> there is no need for me to grant it in light of the fact that I have allowed the Stay Application. Nevertheless, I do not think it would be appropriate to allow the Conversion Application, as it would only replicate what is already in progress in Suit 1048 and result in unnecessary duplication and further multiplicity of proceedings. Moreover, once the disputed issues of fact have been determined in Suit 1048, it will not be necessary to determine them in OS 1446. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In summary, having considered all the circumstances, I find that it is fair and efficient to stay the proceedings of OS 1446 pending the determination of Suit 1048 notwithstanding that this application was literally made at the door step of the hearing of OS 1446. Not only are there overlapping issues in these two proceedings, such overlapping issues include egregious allegations of misconduct potentially amounting to fraud, dishonesty and/or forgery as well as the allegation that the plaintiff had made a false police report. It is more appropriate for such alleged shenanigans to be fully ventilated at the trial of Suit 1048, where more comprehensive evidence will be disclosed, thoroughly tested and the witnesses acutely cross-examined. Further, the stay will not unduly prejudice the first defendant as the plaintiff has withdrawn his claim in OS 1446 and there is an order that the plaintiff will not reinstitute the same action in future. This is the outcome that the first defendant seeks to achieve in her counterclaim in OS 1446. I further order that the validity of the impugned notices and resolutions is to be suspended during the period for which OS 1446 is stayed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I do not think it is appropriate to grant the Conversion Application as it would result in a multiplicity of proceedings <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Suit 1048. Further, since I have granted the Stay Application, there is no need for me to grant the Conversion Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Ultimately, the court’s primary duty is not to tick the boxes but to ensure that it is fair and just to the plaintiff and the first and second defendants. The actions and inactions of the plaintiff may appear to be contrived to avoid being cross-examined by the first defendant’s counsel. I am also cognizant of the fact that this decision may appear to put the first defendant at a tactical disadvantage as it deprives her of the benefits of the plaintiff’s failure to be cross-examined and thus, his inability to rely on his affidavit in OS 1446. However, the allegations made by the plaintiff and the first defendant are extremely serious and the justice of the case warrants that the trial process is necessary to sieve out the truth of their allegations. I have mentioned at the hearing of SUM 3213, when I granted the first defendant’s application to cross-examine the plaintiff, that it is extremely difficult for the court to discern the truth from the affidavit evidence. It is unfortunate that the plaintiff had not applied to cross-examine the first defendant in OS 1446. Therefore, Suit 1048 will be the best forum to serve the ends of justice and for the truth to be precipitated. For these reasons, I grant SUM 2628 and dismiss SUM 2629. The first defendant’s counterclaim in OS 1446 is stayed pending the outcome of Suit 1048, on the condition that the validity of the impugned notices and resolutions is suspended for the duration of the stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I shall now hear parties on the issue of costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eng Zixuan Edmund, Tham Wei Chern, Danica Gan <br/>Fang Ling and Yang Yuanhong Bernard <br/>(Fullerton Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh SC, Tan Siew Wei Cheryl, Pardeep Singh Khosa, Tan Mao Lin, Darveenia Rajula Rajah and Vanessa Poo Jill (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Benny Jude Philomen and Mary-Anne Shu-Hui Chua (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
