        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, PC Connect Pte Ltd operated a
                    retail outlet dealing with computers and related merchandise at #03-38 Funan
                    Digitalife Mall (“the plaintiff’s unit”). The plaintiff
                    instituted these proceedings to seek damages it claimed to have incurred as a
                    result of water leakage from the unit directly above its unit. The unit above,
                    unit #04-38, (“the second defendant’s unit”) was used by the
                    second defendant, Bachmann Japanese Restaurant Pte Ltd, as a Japanese
                    restaurant. The first defendant managed the Funan Digitalife Mall on behalf of
                    the owners, CapitaMall Trust, and was the landlord of both units.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s case was that on
                    3 December 2006 (“the first incident”), then on
                    31 August 2007 and 4 September 2007 (“the second
                    incident”), greasy waste liquid leaked from the second defendant’s
                    unit onto the plaintiff’s unit and damaged the plaintiff’s
                    goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff’s action was in negligence
                    and nuisance. The allegations against the two defendants related to the
                    maintenance of the pipes and drains in the first defendant’s unit, the
                    provision of grease traps and the prevention of water leakage onto the
                    plaintiff’s premises. The plaintiff also invoked on the doctrine of
                        <em>res ipsa loquitur</em>. The plaintiff also
                    proceeded on the basis that the defendants were liable for the leakage in
                    nuisance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff claimed for the costs of the goods
                    damaged by the water, which they quantified as $111,625.75 on 3 December
                    2006 and $134,144.31 on 31 August 2007, and $25,558.51 being loss of profit
                    from both incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first incident – 3<sup>rd</sup> December
                2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff presented its evidence through two
                    witnesses. One was its Business Manager, Melvin Lee Yiew Kee (“Melvin
                    Lee”). His evidence was that the plaintiff’s unit was closed for
                    business between 30 November and 3 December 2006 as its staff were
                    deployed at a computer fair. On 3 December 2006, when they returned to the
                    unit, they found that the floor was wet, water was seeping down the ceiling, and
                    some goods in the unit were damaged. He alerted the first defendant’s
                    Centre Management, which sent someone to the unit to investigate and take
                    photographs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       This account was not corroborated by the records
                    of the first defendant which included a report of leakage on 9 December
                        2006,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> but not on
                    3 December 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However the incident was also referred to in
                    three documents. They were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_i"></a>(i)     a letter from loss adjusters
                        Cunningham Lindsey (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Cunningham Lindsey”)
                        to the plaintiff dated 5 December 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     a letter of Rajah &amp; Tann dated
                        28 December 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                        written on behalf of the plaintiff to the second defendant giving the latter
                        notice of the water leakage on 3 December 2006, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     a letter from loss adjusters
                        Crawford &amp; Co International Pte Ltd, the first defendant’s
                        insurers dated 13 February 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> which referred to
                        the first defendant’s staff giving notice on 4 December 2006 on
                        an incident of water leakage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Against this backdrop, the first defendant
                    accepted that there was water leakage on 3 December 2006, but the second
                    defendant put the plaintiff on formal proof on this issue. In the totality of
                    the evidence, I accept that water leaked onto the plaintiff’s unit on the
                    night of 3 December 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In its letter to the plaintiff, Cunningham
                    Lindsey advised the plaintiff to mitigate its loss and to submit a list of the
                    damaged stocks. On 11 December 2006, the plaintiff informed Cunningham
                    Lindsey that the damaged goods were sold to a buyer for the goods at a 80%
                        discount<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and
                    enclosed a copy of the plaintiff’s invoice/delivery order dated the same
                        day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There were three shortcomings in the way the
                    plaintiff presented its case for the 3 December 2006 incident. Firstly, it
                    had not engaged any qualified party to examine and report on the leak. Secondly,
                    it had not engaged any surveyor to examine, record and tally the damage to the
                    plaintiff’s goods. Thirdly, the plaintiff had not mitigated its losses
                    properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the absence of any independent examination
                    of the premises, there was only Melvin Lee’s evidence that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he floor was wet, and water was seeping through from the
                            ceiling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">which fell well short of the plaintiff’s pleaded case
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">greasy waste liquid seeped from the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant[‘s] property into the
                        Plaintiff’s premises. The waste liquid was seeping out from the pipes,
                        floor traps or other conduit or pipe … and or the floor slab of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant[‘s] property at or around
                        the said pipes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The absence of any independent survey on the
                    goods was also troubling. All that was produced as evidence of the damage was a
                    list prepared by the plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> which was not verified, with
                    no photographs or descriptions of the damage to the goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The enormity of this omission was revealed at
                    the trial. While the plaintiff had pleaded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Some of the Plaintiff[’s] goods were <em>completely
                            damaged</em> by the greasy water<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Melvin Lee, under cross-examination, conceded that the actual damage
                    was restricted to the boxes or packing,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and there was no damage to their
                        contents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     When the plaintiff overstated the damage so
                    grossly, a serious doubt must arise over the accuracy of its count of the boxes
                    or packages that were affected by the water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff pleaded that the affected goods
                    to the value of $111,625.75 were damaged. Melvin Lee’s evidence, however,
                    was that $132,887.80 of goods were damaged, which were sold for $26,577.56, at a
                    loss of 80%. The record of sale produced was the plaintiff’s
                    invoice/delivery order dated 11 December 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Melvin Lee’s evidence was that
                    the damaged goods were sold to a <em>garang guni</em> man
                    dealing in used computer note books and items without packing, who paid for them
                    in cash. The plaintiff had invited just one <em>garang
                        guni</em> man to buy the goods. His identity was not disclosed in the
                    invoice/delivery order and no receipt was issued. There was no evidence that
                    this was a reasonable way for a computer trader to dispose of computers and
                    computer accessories with damaged packaging, or that such goods could only fetch
                    20% of their usual price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff also made a claim for the loss
                    of the profits of $12,210.43 it claimed it would have made from the sale of the
                    goods. Melvin Lee produced a list of the plaintiff’s ranges of profit
                    margins it could make from the sale of the goods and exhibited the
                    suppliers’
                    <em>suggested</em> retail prices for some of the goods.
                    There was no evidence that the plaintiff sold their goods at the
                    suppliers’ suggested prices, and no evidence of the prices the goods were
                    actually sold at. The plaintiff could have proved the profit margin more
                    satisfactorily by producing records of the prices at which it was selling the
                    products. This could be done quite simply by showing invoices and receipts in
                    which the transacted prices are stated. While I accept that the plaintiff would
                    have sold the goods at a profit, I find that the plaintiff had not proved the
                    amount of the lost profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On a review of all the evidence relating to
                    the plaintiff’s claim arising from the leakage on 3 December 2006, I
                    find that firstly, the plaintiff had not proved the leak of greasy waste liquid
                    alleged in its statement of claim, secondly it had not proved the damage that
                    was alleged to have been caused, thirdly that the plaintiff had not mitigated
                    its loss, and lastly that it had not proved its lost profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the result, its claims against both
                    defendants in respect of the leakage of 3 December 2006 are
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second incident – 31 August and 4 September
                2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff’s unit was closed for
                    business from 30 August to 2 September 2007 because there was another
                    computer fair. On 31 August, Melvin Lee and some colleagues went to the
                    unit and found the store room wet and the ceiling dripping. The plaintiff
                    reported the matter to the police and the second defendant and engaged Chin
                    Cheong of Building Appraisal Pte Ltd to inspect the premises. On
                    4 September 2007, when leaking was seen again, he informed Chin Cheong of
                    that. The first defendant accepted that the incidents took place, and produced
                    the incident reports<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>on the incident of 31 August.
                    There was no doubt over the second incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Chin Cheong was a witness for the plaintiff.
                    He is a Chartered Building Surveyor with a degree in Building Survey. He was
                    instructed by the plaintiff in June 2007 to:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There were three other reports which touched
                    on the incident. One was by Eric Poh of McLarens Young International, dated
                    5 January 2007, to the insurers of the second defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In this report, it
                    was stated at p 3:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At this juncture, it would appears [<em>sic</em>]
                        that the water leakage could be due to deteriorated or damaged waterproofing

                        further investigation to determine the ‘cause’ of the
                        deteriorated/damaged waterproofing membrane leading to the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Eric Poh was a loss adjuster, and it was not shown that he had any
                    qualifications in examining the leaks, and his report concluded with a
                    recommendation of a provisional reserve against the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second report was by Crawford &amp; Co

                    defendant. This was a loss adjustment report. The identity and the
                    qualifications of the author of this report were not disclosed. There was also
                    no reference to any inspection of the premises and the report did not go beyond
                    stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is believed faults in the floor waterproofing, was allowing water from

                    Shao Hing of Camden Engineering Associates. He was a professional mechanical
                    engineer engaged by the second defendant in July 2009 after the second defendant
                    had vacated the premises. He did not profess any special knowledge in building
                    inspection. His findings were that he suspected that:</p>

                    called as witnesses at the trial, and their absence further reduced the
                    probative value of their reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On reviewing the evidence, I find Chin
                    Cheong’s findings on the cause of the second incident of water leakage
                    cogent against the background of his professional qualifications, his personal
                    observations of the conditions and his explanations for his
                conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As in the claim arising from the first
                    incident, there was no survey of the affected goods and no proof of the loss of
                    profits in this claim. The other issue, <em>ie</em>, the
                    failure to mitigate the loss, was even more serious. The plaintiff had not sold
                    the alleged affected goods, and was claiming their full cost price. It had not
                    mitigated its loss at all. Consequently, the plaintiff can only be entitled to
                    nominal damages for the loss.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability in negligence for the second incident</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I will examine the respective
                    defendants’ liability for the water leakage. I will start with the
                    position of the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second defendant was in occupation of the
                    unit as a tenant of the first defendant. At the time of the second incident, the
                    second defendant was in occupation of the unit under a tenancy agreement dated
                    15 September 2006 for a term running from 1 August 2006 to
                    31 July 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Clause 2.13.1 of the tenancy agreement provided
                    that it was the tenant’s duty:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To keep the Premises and every part thereof clean and hygienic and tidy
                        and at a standard acceptable to the Landlord and to keep all pipes drains
                        basins sinks and water closets if any in the Premises clean and unblocked.
                        Any cleaners employed by the Tenant for the purposes hereof shall be at the
                        sole expense and responsibility of the Tenant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Was there a duty of care on the second
                    defendant to prevent the water seepage? The second defendant’s unit was
                    directly above the plaintiff’s unit and it was obliged to maintain the
                    pipe. The Court of Appeal declared in <em>Spandek Engineering (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 100 that the governing conditions for the imposition of a
                    duty of care are firstly, legal proximity, and secondly, policy considerations.
                    Applying the test to the facts, I find that the second defendant owed a duty of
                    care to the plaintiff, and that it had failed to discharge the
                duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff’s claim against the first
                    defendant in negligence has to be examined on its own facts. The first defendant
                    was not in occupation of the second defendant’s unit. The pipe in question
                    served the second defendant’s unit exclusively, and the duty to maintain
                    the pipe had been placed on the second defendant. In the circumstances, the
                    first defendant was not under a duty of care to maintain the pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Even if the first defendant had the duty to
                    maintain the pipe, it may not be answerable to the plaintiff for the leakage.
                    The plaintiff was in occupation of unit #03-38, but it was not the first
                    defendant’s tenant. The tenant of the unit was Neat Technology Pte Ltd
                    (“Neat”). Neat had entered into a tenancy agreement for the unit
                    for the period 1 June 2003 to 31 May 2006. At the end of that term,
                    the first defendant offered Neat a further term from 1 June 2006 to
                    31 May 2006 on the terms and conditions set out in the draft tenancy
                    agreement that was forwarded with the offer,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and it was also provided
                    that the terms of the draft tenancy agreement shall apply to the new term even
                    if it was not executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Neat accepted the first defendant’s
                    offer, but the tenancy agreement for the extended term was not executed.
                    However, by cl 4.3.1 of the draft agreement, it was provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding anything herein contained, <em>the Landlord
                            shall not in any way be responsible or liable to the Tenant or its
                            agents invitees and licensees</em> who may be permitted to enter
                        or use the Premises or the Building or any part thereof for accidents
                        happening or injuries sustained whether resulting in death or not <em>for loss of or damage to property goods or chattels</em>
                        in the Premises or the Building or any part thereof <em>howsoever caused</em> and the Tenant shall keep the Landlord
                        fully indemnified against the same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although Neat was the tenant, the plaintiff
                    occupied the unit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> There is a background to
                    this state of affairs. Originally, Neat sold computer and associated products
                    under the “PC Connect” brand name, but that brand was eventually
                    discontinued. Besides being a brand name, “PC Connect” was also
                    used as the plaintiff’s corporate name. The plaintiff had the same
                    shareholders and directors as Neat, and it carried on business in the unit which
                    Neat had been using and paid rent directly to the first defendant although the
                    rent receipts were issued to Neat. The arrangement reflected the close
                    relationship between the two companies. In these circumstances, it can be
                    inferred that the plaintiff had knowledge of the terms of the tenancy agreement
                    that allowed Neat, and through Neat the plaintiff, to occupy the unit. In any
                    event, even if the plaintiff did not have the knowledge, it should not be in a
                    better position than Neat <em>vis-à-vis</em> the first
                    defendant for damages sustained in the premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability in nuisance for the second incident</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Against the backdrop that the second defendant
                    was the occupant of the unit from which water had escaped down to the
                    plaintiff’s unit, the second defendant is liable in nuisance to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the case of the first defendant, the
                    matters referred to in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> to <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> apply to exempt it from
                liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There was also a more important issue: whether
                    the first defendant could be liable for the leakage when it was not in
                    occupation of the second defendant’s unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff submitted that the first
                    defendant was liable in nuisance even if it was not in occupation of the unit
                    and relied on the decision in <em>Wilchick v Marks &amp;
                        Silverstone</em> [1934] 2 KB 56 (“<em>Wilchick</em>”). The facts of the case were that the plaintiff
                    was injured by a falling shutter from a house abutting the highway. The house
                    belonged to the owners who were large property owners to a tenant on a weekly
                    tenancy. The house which was under rent control was rented out to a tailor in a
                    small way of business. There was no contractual liability either on the landlord
                    or the tenant to repair, although the landlord had reserved the right to enter
                    the property and do repairs if they thought fit. The plaintiff brought an action
                    against the landlord and the tenant, and succeeded against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Goddard J stated in his judgment (at
                    p 67) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a landlord lets premises on which he knows that a nuisance exists but
                        takes a covenant from his tenant to put or keep them in repair, no liability
                        remains in him … but there is no case which precisely covers the
                        present facts, where, neither landlord nor tenant being under covenant to
                        repair, the former reserves the right to enter and do necessary repairs and,
                        knowing that repairs are necessary, fails to do them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And further (at 67) that :</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A property owner knows that his house if not repaired must at
                        some time get into a dangerous state: he lets it to a tenant and puts him
                        under no obligation to keep it repaired: it may be the tenant is one who
                        from lack of means could not do any repairs. The landlord has expressly
                        reserved to himself the right to enter and do necessary repairs: why then
                        should he be under no duty to make it safe for passers by when he knows that
                        the property is dangerous? The proximity is there: he has the right to enter
                        and remedy a known danger. Is the injured person to be left in such a case
                        only to a remedy against the tenant, who in this sort of tenancy, which
                        commonly obtains only with regard to small properties, is probably in quite
                        humble circumstances?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It can be readily seen that the facts are
                    distinguishable from the facts of the present case. Firstly, the first defendant
                    had placed the duty to maintain the pipe on the tenant. Secondly, the
                    socio-economic conditions in <em>Wilchick</em> are not
                    present in the present case. There was no suggestion that the second defendant
                    lacked the means to maintain the pipes and to pay damages, and it was insured
                    against such risks. I find that the reasoning in <em>Wilchick</em> does not apply to the present case and the first
                    defendant should not be liable for the leakage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There was another fundamental issue in the
                    action in nuisance. This claim was for private nuisance affecting the
                    plaintiff’s unit. The Court of Appeal had noted in <em>Epolar System Enterprises Pte Ltd and others v Lee Hock Chuan and
                        others</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 198 at [10] that generally only
                    a person with proprietary interest such as a freehold or leasehold interest can
                    bring proceedings in private nuisance, and as a rule, occupation <em>per se</em> will not suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the Court also referred to some cases
                    in which it had been found that a person in <em>de
                        facto</em> possession by way of exclusive possession may be entitled
                    to sue. The Court then went on to find that the first, second and third
                    plaintiffs in that case who were occupying and carrying on business in the
                    premises were in possession of the premises in their own right, and were
                    entitled to sue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the present case, the plaintiff had taken
                    over the unit from Neat<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> and had carried on business
                    there. It paid rent directly to the first defendant and relieved Neat from that
                    burden. It had the physical possession of the unit, if not the tenancy. While it
                    did not have a proprietary interest in the unit in the form of a freehold or a
                    leasehold interest, it has a right from Neat to occupy the unit, and it has the
                    capacity to sue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On the evidence, I find that it has proved its
                    claim against the second defendant. However, for the reasons stated in <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>, it had not proved its damages, and it will
                    only be awarded nominal damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Third Party Proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The first defendant had, in addition to
                    defending the plaintiff’s claim, commenced third party proceedings against
                    the second defendant for the latter to indemnify it against any liability
                    towards the plaintiff. The second defendant had denied that it was obliged to
                    indemnify the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The first defendant’s claim for
                    indemnity was founded in Cl 2.13.1 and Cl 2.13.5 of the tenancy
                    agreement with the second defendant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> under which the second
                    defendant was obliged:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.13.1   To keep the Premises and every part thereof clean
                        and hygienic and tidy and at a standard acceptable to the Landlord and to
                        keep all pipes drains basins sinks and water closets if any in the Premises
                        clean and unblocked. Any cleaners employed by the Tenant for the purposes
                        hereof shall be at the sole expense and responsibility of the Tenant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.13.5   Without prejudice to any other provision in this
                        Tenancy Agreement, to indemnify the Landlord against all costs claims
                        liabilities fines or other expenses whatsoever which may fall upon the
                        Landlord by reason of any non-compliance with the provisions of this clause
                        2.13.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The first defendant was entitled to seek to be
                    indemnified by the second defendant against the plaintiff’s claims against
                    it arising from the water leakage. Although the plaintiff’s claims against
                    the first defendant ultimately failed, the third party proceedings were properly
                    taken out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     (i)      The plaintiff’s claims against the
                    first defendant are dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The plaintiff is to have judgment
                        against the second defendant for the second incident with nominal damages of
                        $100.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The
                        second defendant shall pay costs of the third party proceedings to the first
                        defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I will hear the parties on costs in connection
                    with the plaintiff’s claims.</p>
