The plaintiff was to transfer a principal sum of money (which eventually amounted to a total of S$1,784,350) to the defendant, who would hold it and invest it in equity stocks on stock exchanges in Singapore and/or Hong Kong for and on behalf of the plaintiff. On the plaintiff’s demand at any time, the defendant was to fully account for and return to the plaintiff the principal sum, along with all profits, dividends and benefits derived therefrom. The defendant would then be remunerated according to the investment returns, with the quantum of remuneration to be determined after the investment returns had been accounted for. If the investment resulted in losses for the plaintiff, the defendant would not be remunerated.

That, the defendant says, was executed in connection with a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> agreement, which he terms the “Asset Exchange Agreement”. The Asset Exchange Agreement came about from a conversation between the defendant and Li on 12 March 2018, wherein Li conveyed a request from Zhang for the defendant to provide funds from the Accounts (which were outside the PRC) to Weiye for its use outside the PRC. In exchange, an equivalent sum in RMB would be transferred to the defendant’s personal bank account in the PRC. The defendant would also be reimbursed for the entirety of the personal income tax he would incur in the PRC as a result of the assets exchanged (which in essence leads to a remittance of the defendant’s monies in Singapore currency in Singapore back to China in RMB in exchange for a remittance of the plaintiff’s monies in RMB out of China to Singapore in Singapore currency).

Alternatively, the defendant holds the principal sum, the investment returns and the first tranche of RMB680,000 in income tax – as well as all profits derived therefrom – on trust for the plaintiff. Both the Investment Agreement and the trusteeship are governed by Singapore law.

He argues that neither the Investment Agreement nor the trustee relationship has been proven. Even if the court were to find that either had been proven by the plaintiff, each would be invalid or unenforceable, whether under PRC law or Singapore law. On the contrary, it is the plaintiff who has breached the Asset Exchange Agreement, and the defendant counterclaims for the equivalent in RMB of the HK$2,785,000 transferred by Xu to Li and the balance of his unpaid personal income tax of RMB509,071.74.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As will be clear by this juncture, the parties’ narratives are practically irreconcilable.

</div> I fail to see how this might found any inferences as to Zhang’s beneficial ownership of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Next, the defendant argues that the employees and senior management of the plaintiff are linked to Zhang: for instance, Li and Wang were previously employed by Weiye or Weiye’s related companies. From this, the defendant extrapolates that Li and Wang, along with potentially others, had been placed in key positions in the plaintiff by Zhang so that he would have trusted individuals who would carry out his instructions within the plaintiff.

Similarly, even if I accept the authenticity of the salary guide (which the plaintiff strenuously denies

In this respect, I find that Li, at least, did have some ties with Zhang. For instance, they are cousins, although some years apart in age and according to Li not very close. A company which Li was involved in was also party to a suit in the PRC with Zhang in recent years, though the court in that case did not make any findings as to any sort of personal relationship between the two individuals. However, once again, I do not find that these facts adduced by the defendant prove to any significant degree that Zhang wielded control over Li and Wang, and that they were at all relevant times mere extensions of his will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In short, I accept that there exists evidence tying Zhang to various companies and parties in this matter. However, the defendant’s allegations go further than that: he says that Zhang was and is the mastermind behind various events leading up to and including this suit. Yet, the evidence which the defendant has presented in this regard is at best circumstantial in some respects and is non-existent in others. Accordingly, I do not consider the defendant to have made his case out in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is also a constant refrain of the defendant, in respect of particular aspects of the plaintiff’s conduct or the litigation, that Zhang had directed some specific chicanery. In other words, Zhang was the puppeteer behind the scenes. It suffices to say that the defendant furnishes insufficient evidence to reveal Zhang’s unseen hand and to prove these allegations. I therefore make no further mention of Zhang’s supposed manipulation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In any event, I observe that Zhang’s involvement is ultimately secondary to the question at the core of this matter: was the S$1,784,350 transferred into the defendant’s UOB account as <span class="font-italic">remuneration</span> for the defendant (pursuant to Zhang Wei’s Arrangement), or was it transferred as the <span class="font-italic">principal sum for investment</span> on behalf of the plaintiff (pursuant to the Investment Agreement)?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Zhang Wei’s Arrangement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I begin with Zhang Wei’s Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Before I proceed, I note that the defendant has argued that he ultimately does not bear any legal burden of proving the existence or enforceability of Zhang Wei’s Arrangement.

</div> This is true in one sense: it is the plaintiff’s case that the S$1,784,350 was transferred to the defendant as a principal sum for investment, and if the plaintiff does not prove on the balance of probabilities that this was the case – as opposed to any alternative explanations – then its claim will fail. In that sense, the burden of proof in relation to the Investment Agreement rests on the plaintiff and not the defendant. However, in asserting one such alternative explanation that it was to be the defendant’s remuneration (instead of an investment) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> Zhang Wei’s Arrangement), the defendant bears the burden of proof with regard to that alternative explanation: see s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “EA”).

I use “generous” here not merely in the sense that RMB9 million is a large sum, but also that Zhang would have had to be extremely generous of spirit to take the defendant at his word that he could leave Weiye to manage a RMB100 million fund as a fund manager – again, without any prior experience – and to decide to remunerate the defendant handsomely and in advance on that basis and without any proof of his performance as a fund manager yet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Further, the investment consultancy and management services which the defendant professed in his AEIC to have offered Zhang turned out at cross-examination to be as such: “basically Zhang Wei would tell me what shares he wanted to buy and I basically had to obey what he said”.

</div> RMB9 million would be, very roughly, 30% of that sum. That would be a remarkable amount to be paying somebody to merely carry out instructions to purchase a single company’s shares. I find it hard to believe that the defendant, who was to merely execute Zhang’s instructions to buy Weiye’s shares, would need to be rewarded RMB9 million by Zhang as remuneration. These appeared to be administrative actions not unlike those of a stock trading remisier in a stock broking firm. Furthermore, based on the transaction records, these purchases were rather infrequent. There was no active trading in Weiye’s shares. In other words, even as administrative work, there was hardly any work done as a whole for Zhang over the three years for the defendant to deserve that huge sum of remuneration paid.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, I do not find persuasive the defendant’s argument that the value of his services lay in allowing Zhang to delist Weiye in 2018. The question is whether it is likely that Zhang would have entered into this arrangement with the defendant in December 2014. It does not make commercial sense that Zhang would have in 2014 considered RMB9 million a reasonable commission, so to speak, to pay someone to buy HK$30 million worth of shares, for a delisting exercise that was to take place four years later in 2018. I find it difficult to believe, in the first place, that Zhang would have foreseen and therefore already planned for a delisting four years in advance, and therefore pay the defendant his full remuneration upfront to assist in that delisting, even if the defendant’s future work could be valued as RMB9 million. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It is often said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

It is disingenuous for the defendant to argue in the face of the discrepancy in the name and the seal on the Letter of Undertaking that the plaintiff lacks any basis for its assertion. The official documents concerning the destruction of the old company stamp are strong evidence that the seal on the Letter of Undertaking was not genuine. At trial, Li strongly rejected the possibility that papers might have been pre-stamped: he was the legal representative of the plaintiff at the time, and he would have known of such a use of the stamp. I accept Li’s evidence in this regard. The defendant’s allegation that the plaintiff might have deliberately used the old company seal is pure conjecture; notwithstanding the general observations of the apex court of the PRC, the defendant has not provided any evidence to suggest that in this particular case, the plaintiff undertook such devious actions. I therefore find that the Letter of Undertaking is not genuine, and it provides no support for Zhang Wei’s Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Text Messages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Third, the defendant relies on the Text Messages as evidence of the work he did for Zhang.

There is nothing in Zhang Wei’s Arrangement, as alleged, that the defendant was also to personally cover any losses incurred when his suggestions were followed. This being the case, he could simply have worded his proposal as a suggestion without any offer to make up for the losses.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I do not find that the Emails support the existence of Zhang Wei’s Arrangement. As with the Liu Yang Document and the Text Messages, the Emails indicate that the defendant was perhaps performing some work for Zhang (which appears here to be more auditing/accounting work rather than that of an investment adviser). Nothing in the Emails supports the defendant’s pleaded case that he was remunerated RMB9 million in advance for such work. I therefore find that the Emails do not support the existence of Zhang Wei’s Arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It appears likely that Zhang had indeed tasked the defendant to carry out some work, as seen from the Liu Yang Document and the Text Messages. However, it is equally apparent – not least from the evidence of the defendant himself – that the work done by the defendant was very much limited in scope and scale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It seems unlikely to me that in 2014, Zhang, upon hearing that the defendant might leave Weiye to manage about RMB100 million of funds (despite his apparent lack of experience as a fund manager), jumped to offer the defendant RMB9 million to retain his services. Had he indeed done so, as the defendant alleges, then surely he must have had great trust in the defendant’s acumen and judgment, and would have desired to exploit the defendant’s services for maximum returns on that initial remuneration. Yet, instead of being provided with a commensurate level of funds to invest as he would, the defendant was kept strictly to a tight mandate executing trades for HK$30 million of Weiye shares on Zhang’s instructions. None of the evidence proffered by the defendant provided any support for this commercially unlikely state of affairs. I therefore find that Zhang has failed to prove his case on Zhang Wei’s Arrangement on the balance of probabilities – specifically, that the RMB9 million was paid as a lump sum in advance to the defendant as his remuneration for his fund management services to be performed over the next three years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 It is pertinent at this juncture to note that the allegation that the payment of S$1,784,350 was the Singapore dollars equivalent of RMB9 million implies an exchange rate of approximately S$1:RMB5.0438. However, a quick check from the historical records of the exchange rate for the period in December 2014 shows that the market exchange rate was approximately S$1:RMB4.7 instead.

</div> If so, the sum of RMB9 million would translate to S$1,914,893, a much larger amount. I do not think that the defendant would be inclined to accept and suffer a shortfall of S$130,543 in his promised remuneration to be paid to him in Singapore dollars. Another puzzle is why the defendant would want his remuneration to be paid in Singapore dollars when he is domiciled in China. All these serve to weaken the defendant’s assertion that the RMB9 million or equivalent of S$1,784,350 was in fact paid to him as a lump sum remuneration for his future services for the next three years.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Investment Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I turn now to the plaintiff’s explanation for the transfer of the S$1,784,350 into the UOB Account – <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Investment Agreement – which it in turn must prove on the balance of probabilities in order to found its claim. In short, that explanation is that the plaintiff borrowed the S$1,784,350 from various intermediaries (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> Li, Liu Hongen, Max Fill and Well Fai), and then had those intermediaries transfer those sums to the UOB Account as a principal sum for the defendant to invest on its behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I do not agree with some of the defendant’s arguments as to why the Investment Agreement is inherently absurd.

</div> I accept that three to four years (from 2015 to 2018) is a long time for the defendant to be doing work for the plaintiff without immediate or ongoing remuneration. Nonetheless, as seen in the text message highlighted above at [60], the defendant was keen to develop his investment skills, to the point where he offered to Zhang to cover any losses incurred through his trading. Further, both Li and the defendant agree that they were friends in early 2015, when the Investment Agreement was said to have been made. I do not think it inherently unlikely that Li approached the defendant with an offer to invest on behalf of the plaintiff, and that the defendant accepted that he would be remunerated based on the performance of the investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendant also states that it would have been senseless for the plaintiff to transfer investment moneys to an account wholly controlled by the defendant.

It is not clear that the arrangement put forth by the defendant as the sensible thing to do would have resulted in greater security for the plaintiff. In any event, I accept Li’s evidence that he reposed a great deal of trust in the defendant, stemming from their friendship.

</div> There are valid concerns here: if such documents were to be simply accepted, overseas witnesses might choose to selectively participate in litigation in Singapore, by furnishing statements and documents while being safe in the knowledge that they cannot be cross-examined. However, the proper approach in this regard is not to exclude the statutory declarations under s 32(3) of the EA, but to admit them while according them less weight. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2015] 2 SLR 686 at [109], “[t]he court should not normally exercise its discretion to exclude evidence that is declared to be admissible by the EA”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the circumstances, while I do not accord the statutory declarations full weight, they do state, plainly and simply, that the transfers from Li, Max Fill and Well Fai to the UOB Account were made on behalf of the plaintiff, pursuant to loan agreements between those intermediaries and the plaintiff. I therefore do consider the statutory declarations to corroborate the plaintiff’s version of events to some degree.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Declaration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Lastly, the plaintiff relies heavily upon the Declaration and the clear statement therein that the defendant did not own any of the cash deposits and stocks in the Accounts. I accept Li’s evidence that the plaintiff obtained the Declaration from the defendant on 15 March 2018, over concerns that the defendant was being investigated by Weiye for breaches of corporate financial management policies. The plaintiff has adduced text messages from the defendant to Li from January 2018, wherein the defendant shared that he was currently under investigation.

</div> that is immaterial.

</div> But hindsight is perfect. Even in the defendant’s own account, the parties involved were businessmen who apparently thought it prudent to enter multimillion-dollar agreements on nothing but their word. I do not find it incongruous for such parties to have subsequently drafted and executed a declaration making no reference to the underlying transaction. What would have mattered to the plaintiff at the time would have been recording that the moneys in the Accounts belonged to it and not the defendant, and that the defendant would cooperate in transferring the moneys to the plaintiff. This is recorded clearly in the Declaration. While completeness would have entailed a mention of the Investment Agreement as well, it is not unlikely that the parties simply did not think to include it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In contrast, it is the defendant’s explanation of the Declaration that is difficult to believe. The defendant says that the Declaration was executed to show his commitment to upholding his end of the Asset Exchange Agreement.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-41d13f33-adc2-4013-9b1b-76e3719a1638" data-toggle="modal" type="button">128</button></sup>

</div> But the terms of the Declaration are fundamentally different from the alleged terms of the Asset Exchange Agreement. First, although the defendant has explained that the Asset Exchange Agreement entailed giving Zhang and/or Weiye the freedom to withdraw assets from the Accounts,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-8fa4deb8-a868-40e2-8371-858daca8ddd3" data-toggle="modal" type="button">129</button></sup>

</div>
</div> the Declaration makes no mention of Zhang or Weiye, and refers to the plaintiff instead. Second, the Declaration does not mention a freedom to withdraw assets, or access to the Accounts, but instead unequivocally states that the contents of the Accounts are <span class="font-italic">owned </span>by the plaintiff. Third, the Declaration is strictly one-sided: it does not describe any accompanying obligation on the part of Zhang or Weiye or even the plaintiff to reimburse the defendant. Yet this reimbursement was a key part of the Asset Exchange Agreement. If the Declaration had indeed been meant to reflect the Asset Exchange Agreement, the omission of the reimbursement would surely have been extremely troubling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 All this is to say that it is difficult to believe that the Declaration had anything to do with the Asset Exchange Agreement as pleaded by the defendant, and that if it did, it is surprising – to say the least – that the defendant was willing to sign it. I find the plaintiff’s explanation for the Declaration far more likely, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the defendant was responsible for the plaintiff’s moneys, and executed the Declaration to assuage the plaintiff’s worries that the defendant might misappropriate the moneys in the Accounts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In conclusion, while there is one aspect of the Investment Agreement which gives me pause – concerning the fixed interest rate of 12% per annum for the loan – the objective evidence both around the time of the Investment Agreement and thereafter coheres to and supports the plaintiff’s version of events. I therefore find that it is the plaintiff’s explanation for the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of the transfer of the S$1,784,350 into the UOB Account – <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for investment purposes under the Investment Agreement, and not as a lump sum remuneration of RMB9 million for future services to be provided by the defendant over the next three years under Zhang Wei’s Agreement – that has been proven on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Asset Exchange Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 My consideration of the Declaration leads me directly to the final agreement to be considered: the Asset Exchange Agreement.

</div> It was as part of this agreement that the sum of RMB680,000 was paid to him through the plaintiff in September 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I find that the picture painted by the defendant makes no sense. In the first place, on the defendant’s account, there is no apparent connection between his personal income tax and the Asset Exchange Agreement. This was not disputed by the defendant: when this issue was raised to him on cross-examination, the defendant simply testified that it was a condition which he put to Zhang, in exchange for his acquiescence to the Asset Exchange Agreement.

</div> But why, then, would Zhang agree to pay what amounted to a significant premium? Even on the defendant’s own case, Zhang had his own access to funds outside of the PRC: after all, he was allegedly able to transfer, through various actors and agents, the S$1,784,350 to the UOB Account in 2015. There was no indication that Zhang had to pay any additional expenses in the form of “income tax” then. The sum which was allegedly withdrawn from the CCB Account in connection with the Asset Exchange Agreement – HK$2,785,000 – is far smaller. Hence, even taking the defendant at his word, I fail to see why Zhang could not simply have routed RMB sums equivalent to that HK$2,785,000 out of the PRC, without having to beg the defendant for assistance and, most importantly, without having to be concerned with paying a very substantial income tax gratuitously on behalf of the defendant, which would have added considerably and unnecessarily to Zhang’s cost of simply remitting RMB out of China to Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The defendant’s explanation for this is that the channels for such movement of funds out of the PRC no longer existed in 2018.

</div> However, even if I were to accept this, I find it highly unlikely that the defendant was the only person to whom Zhang could turn to who had access to funds outside of the PRC. If Zhang’s reach and influence were as extensive as the defendant alleges, he must have been able to find someone else who would not demand such a significant premium. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In truth, the characterisation of the RMB680,000 as income tax strikes me as being far more consonant with the Investment Agreement. I accept Li’s evidence that the plaintiff was ready, as a matter of principle, to compensate the defendant for any costs he might incur arising from the Investment Agreement.

</div> In this light, the plaintiff’s payment of any personal income tax the defendant might incur in respect of the assets in the Accounts makes far more sense. I consider the defendant’s explanation for this sum to be a poor attempt at reconciling the incontrovertible fact of the RMB680,000 payment from the plaintiff to him with his narrative that he owed the plaintiff no obligations of any sort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In short, I consider the Asset Exchange Agreement to be inherently unlikely. Further, this improbable state of affairs is not supported by any objective evidence. The main documentary evidence cited for the defendant’s case in this regard is the Declaration, which I have already dealt with. Accordingly, I find that the Asset Exchange Agreement has not been proven on the balance of probabilities. It follows that the defendant’s counterclaim thereunder is a non-starter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For completeness, I note that even on the defendant’s pleaded case – that the Asset Exchange Agreement was made between him and Zhang, through Li and the plaintiff as conduits – the defendant’s counterclaim should have been made not against the plaintiff, but against Zhang instead.

</div> This brings us to the second stage of inferring the parties’ intentions. Given that the Investment Agreement was oral in nature, with few contemporaneous documents that might shed light on the intention of the parties as to the choice of law, I do not think that it will be fruitful to dwell too much on this stage (see, in this regard, <span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton Corp v Khoo Teng Hock Sunny </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 589 (“<span class="font-italic">Las Vegas Hilton</span>”) at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I therefore proceed directly to the third stage: determining objectively the system of law with which the contract has its closest and most real connection.

</div> both parties are ordinarily based in the PRC, and the Investment Agreement was entered into in the PRC. The commercial purpose and place of performance of the Investment Agreement (namely, to invest in equity stocks on stock exchanges in Singapore <span class="font-italic">and/or Hong Kong</span>) do not indicate a strong connection to Singapore <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span>. Further, there is no suggestion that the parties sought legal advice as to Singapore law prior to entering the Investment Agreement. I think that a just and reasonable person in the parties’ positions would hesitate greatly before jumping feet first into unfamiliar legal waters; taking such a plunge does not strike me as an approach likely to result in the most convenient and efficacious way to resolve any future disputes. Although the principal sum transferred to the defendant was denominated in Singapore dollars, I do not think that that, weighed against the other factors, is sufficient to indicate that just and reasonable persons would have intended for Singapore law to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I turn, therefore, to a consideration of the formation and validity of the Investment Agreement under PRC law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Formation and validity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The plaintiff’s position is that under PRC law, the Investment Agreement gave rise to what is known in PRC law as a “contractual entrustment” or a “mandate contract”, “whereby the principal and the agent agree that the latter shall handle the affairs of the former”.

However, the defendant has not explained how this mechanism of attribution might function in PRC law, or whether it even exists. The defendant has not even shown that the contravention of Art 30 of the Administrative Measures by a natural person can result in the invalidation of a related contract to which he is not a party. Second, the defendant’s own expert witness, Prof Liu, gave evidence that the notion of “public interests” in Art 52(4) of the PRC Contract Law is “ill-defined”, and that the invalidation of a contract for contravening that ground is only rarely granted.

The figure of $1,113,161.05 appears to have been derived from the tax report prepared by the defendant in August 2018, wherein this figure was listed as the defendant’s dividend income in Singapore dollars for the period from 1 January 2018 to 31 August 2018.

</div> It is not clear to me why this particular figure ought to represent the investment returns from the Investment Agreement. For one, I would have expected the dollar value of the investment returns to have been calculated over the full period of the Investment Agreement instead. Moreover, the tax report indicates a further dividend income obtained in Hong Kong of HK$420,600;

I therefore order that there be an inquiry as to the quantum of the investment returns procured by the defendant from the underlying principal sum of S$1,784,350, and that the defendant return the investment returns to the plaintiff upon the conclusion of the inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 However, as I have already found, the defendant has already returned HK$2,785,000 to the plaintiff. Accordingly, this sum of HK$2,785,000 is to be set off against his obligation to return the principal sum of S$1,784,350 and the assessed investment returns to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for the sum of RMB680,000, the defendant argues that he is entitled to retain this sum as part of the expenses he incurred in the course of his duties.

</div> I accept that the plaintiff was under an obligation to reimburse the defendant for such expenses (plus interest accrued thereon in accordance with Art 398 of the PRC Contract law), and that personal income tax which the defendant had or would have incurred through the performance of his duties would fall into that category of expenses. However, the defendant has not provided evidence to show that he did, in fact, pay the PRC tax authorities any of the income tax which he purportedly owed according to his 2018 tax report. Indeed, when cross-examined on whether he had done so, the defendant was evasive.

</div> I therefore order that the RMB680,000 be repaid to the plaintiff. Nonetheless, I decline to make a conclusive finding at this stage as to whether the defendant had in fact paid any income tax. In my view, the justice of the case demands that a broader accounting of the defendant’s expenses be taken. I order that an assessment of the expenses incurred by the defendant be undertaken at the following stage of the trial, and that the total amount assessed, including any tax he has in fact paid or will have to pay to the PRC tax authorities as a result of his performance of his duties under the Investment Agreement, be set off from any sums owing to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The defendant further submits that he should be entitled to set off his remuneration, which was to be agreed between the parties upon the conclusion of the Investment Agreement, against any sums owing to the plaintiff as well.

Against these sums owing to the plaintiff, the defendant is entitled to set off both his reasonable remuneration and his actual expenses (inclusive of (a) any tax he has in fact paid or will have to pay to the PRC tax authorities as a result of his performance of his duties under the Investment Agreement and (b) any interest accrued on these expenses, in accordance with Art 398 of the PRC Contract law).
