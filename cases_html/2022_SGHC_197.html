From 1985 to the present, the appellant had not been able to stay crime free in the community for any significant period of time. Further, his antecedents reflected a pattern of violent behaviour and a blatant disregard for authority.

</div> Notwithstanding that in recent years the appellant managed to stay crime free for a longer period of time, possibly as he had been staying at the Angsana Home with less access to alcohol; the appellant still failed to stay away from offending for even a period of two years. The appellant also committed numerous offences within the Angsana Home in 2016 and 2017, thus indicating that residing in the Angsana Home itself was insufficient to prevent him from reoffending.

Although the appellant had indicated that he intended to go through with a programme run by NAMS to deal with his alcohol problem, nothing concrete was put forward. Neither was there anything concrete put forward in respect of the appellant’s purported intention to request for a switch to having injected medication in the future. In addition, although the appellant had reconnected with his family between the issuance of the 1st and 2nd PD reports, the DJ found that the assurance of familial support was too vague and insubstantial to be relied upon. The appellant had not been in contact with his family for the last 15 to 16 years and it was simply not realistic to believe that a close and trusted relationship with his elder sister could be formed immediately upon his release such as to enable her to be in a position to adequately control and guide him in his efforts at rehabilitation and reintegration.

Moreover, there were no significant protective factors to justify a reduced term being given.

Therefore, the ultimate issue for determination is whether the DJ was correct in finding that it was expedient for the protection of the public for a sentence of PD to be imposed on the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on preventive detention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The overarching consideration applicable to PD was reiterated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh </span>[2019] 5 SLR 1037 at [52]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well established that the foundation of the sentence of preventive detention is the <span class="font-italic">need to protect the public</span>. This is clear from the wording of s 304(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) itself … which states that the court shall sentence the accused to preventive detention if the court is satisfied that “it is expedient for the protection of the public”. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Rosli bin Yassin </span>[2013] 2 SLR 831 at [11] observed that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The overarching principle is the need <span class="font-italic">to protect the public </span>… Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but is not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. As Yong Pung How CJ put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">PP v Wong Wing Hung </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Wing Hung</span>”) at [10], the “sentence [of preventive detention] is meant essentially for <span class="font-italic">habitual </span>offenders, who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be <span class="font-italic">beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation</span>”. The court will look at the <span class="font-italic">totality </span>of the offender’s previous convictions. (see the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Ngin Hai v PP </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152 at [7]). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 To summarise, if an individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his reform, thus constituting a menace to the public, a sentence of PD would appropriately be imposed on him for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. In its assessment, the court will have regard to the totality of the offender’s previous convictions viewed together with the circumstances of the offender’s present offending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Importantly, since a sentence of PD is underpinned by the need to protect the public, it differs from a sentence of imprisonment and different considerations may apply in determining the appropriate duration and implementation of the sentence. As Yong CJ explained in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 145 at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In this regard, I must reiterate my earlier exhortation in <span class="font-italic">PP v Wong Wing Hung</span> … at [10] not to confuse the concept of preventive detention and imprisonment, which are distinct sentences and are underpinned by different objectives and rationales. The former is essentially aimed at the protection of the public while the latter reflects the traditional policies of prevention, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. They are different in duration, character and implementation. As such, it would be a mistake to view them as fungible sentences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 With the above sentencing considerations in mind, the question is whether the DJ correctly found that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to a term of PD. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of findings in the 1st and 2nd PD reports </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I first consider whether the DJ was correct to find that the grounds which Mr Cheng relied on to anchor his findings in the two PD reports were sound and credible, and therefore capable of reliance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Before I begin my analysis, it is important to bear in mind that the ultimate question of whether it is expedient for the protection of the public that an offender should be sentenced to PD remains a question solely for the court’s determination.

</div> these reports are not conclusive of the question. It remains for the court to make its own holistic assessment of all relevant facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I now return to the analysis of the findings in the PD reports. In my view, the DJ was entirely justified in arriving at her conclusion that the findings in the two PD reports were sound and reliable. Accordingly, her decision to rely on their contents and the conclusions therein that the appellant “belong[ed] to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within 2 years of release” with a high general risk of reoffending and high risk for violent reoffending was unimpeachable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The risk factors identified by Mr Cheng in both the PD reports included the appellant’s: (a) failure to assume responsibility and/or minimisation and justification of his violent offending; (b) alcohol use; and (c) non-compliance with his psychiatric medication. Although the appellant only takes issue with the first risk factor identified (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his failure to assume responsibility), I will address all three risk factors for completeness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appellant’s failure to assume responsibility for and/or minimisation and justification of his violent offending</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The appellant argues that the DJ was wrong to accept Mr Cheng’s findings in the PD reports that he failed to assume responsibility for his actions. He claims that Mr Cheng had erroneously reached this conclusion having wrongly assessed him to have not been forthcoming during the interview leading up to the preparation of the 1st PD report.

</div> Pertinently, a large part of Mr Cheng’s testimony centred around why he had found that the appellant failed to assume responsibility for his actions. Thus, the appellant’s sudden volte-face and candidness in assuming responsibility for his conduct must be viewed with a degree of scepticism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, and most tellingly of the appellant’s true state of mind was his active minimisation and justification of his violent offending. This was plain during his testimony in court as well as from the recorded observations of Mr Cheng in the 2nd PD report:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When the appellant was asked by the Prosecution why he had committed the present offences, he replied: “I don’t remember exactly but the person [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first victim] at the home would keep disturbing [him].

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The appellant’s natural instinct was to point his finger at the first victim and push the blame for his offending conduct onto him. Instead of taking responsibility for his own unprovoked act of violence, he sought to justify his actions by claiming that the first victim would “keep disturbing” him. He even went a step further to minimise the severity of his offences by saying that he had only hit the first victim “lightly”. This could not be further from the truth. As apparent from the Statement of Facts which the appellant admitted to, the appellant had punched the first victim not once, but thrice, aiming at a vulnerable part of his body, his face. The injuries caused to the first victim were severe – he had been found to have suffered broken teeth, a fracture of maxillary alveolar bone and swelling over his right eye. These injuries were clearly not the result of a “light” hit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the 2nd PD report, Mr Cheng recorded that the appellant had “denied being a violent individual and shared that most of his actions were retaliation in response to perceived threats or provocations”. Crucially, for his present offence, he shared that “it takes two hands to clap. Surely something must have triggered me”. The appellant evidently demonstrates little remorse and insight into his past violent offending. Indeed, his denial of being a violent individual flies in the face of his past convictions for violence-related offences in 1989, 1991, 1994 (where he was sentenced to ten years of PD), 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2016 and 2020 (the present set of offences).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the 2nd PD report, it was also recorded that he had minimised the violence against his ex-wife (in relation to his past breaches of Personal Protection Orders). The appellant claimed that he would “joke with no expression” and suggested that his ex-wife was unable to take his jokes. He also claimed that he “never punch[ed] her, maybe just 1 to 2 slaps only”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is beyond peradventure that the appellant did not truly assume responsibility for his offending conduct. His empty recognition of this during the interview with Mr Cheng leading up to the preparation of the 2nd PD report was merely lip service. When probed further, it was apparent that he would at every opportunity seek to externalise the blame for his offences onto his unfortunate victims. The appellant’s claim that he actively assumed responsibility for his offending conduct thus rings hollow in light of his persistent minimisation and justification of his violent offending.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appellant’s alcohol use</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The appellant does not dispute that his alcohol use as identified in the PD reports is a relevant risk factor, and I am satisfied that this finding is well supported by evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In the appellant’s IMH report, it was opined that the appellant “had alcohol intoxication at the material time of the offence on the background of an alcohol use disorder”.

He had been convicted on 22 prior occasions. In particular, as mentioned above at [61(b)], the appellant had been convicted for violence-related offences in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2016 and 2020 (in respect of the present offences). The appellant’s conviction in 2004 involved offences for robbery and carrying an offensive weapon, and he was ordered to serve a term of ten years’ PD. It appears that none of the prior sentences imposed have successfully deterred the appellant from a life of crime. Even the appellant’s earlier term of PD had no effect on his propensity to commit violence-related offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The appellant seeks to argue that the DJ erred in failing to consider the decrease in his recidivism rate and the decrease in the severity of his offending.

</div> This is further confirmed by the SPS Clarificatory Report. As stated above at [43(a)], the appellant was offered three rehabilitation programmes following his admission to prison: (a) the Motivational Programme, (b) the Family Programme and (c) the Psychology-based Correctional Programme. Most relevantly, the Psychology-based Correctional Programme was a programme targeted at “multiple areas of need including general attitudes supportive of crime <span class="font-italic">as well as substance and alcohol abuse</span>”. If the appellant had genuinely intended to seek help for his alcohol problem, he would have signed up for this programme at the first opportunity. However, the SPS Clarificatory Report indicated otherwise. It stated that the appellant had initially <span class="font-italic">refused</span> to attend all three rehabilitation programmes offered to him and had only agreed to attend the programmes on 7 June 2022; this was notably <span class="font-italic">after</span> the court had directed parties to answer the questions posed concerning the appellant’s efforts at seeking out rehabilitation options in prison. I should add that I am not convinced by the appellant’s submission that he was unable to immediately enrol in the rehabilitation programmes “due to certain health conditions” he was experiencing at the time.

Indeed, I agree with the Prosecution that the appellant’s initial refusal to attend the programmes was more significant in demonstrating the appellant’s continued failure to assume responsibility for his conduct and lack of motivation to seek to rehabilitate himself to prevent further reoffending.

</div> In any event, it is unclear whether switching the mode of administration of his medication would have the desired effect of reducing his side effects. As Mr Cheng testified, the appellant had only expressed his <span class="font-italic">belief</span> that this would be so, and it was uncertain if he had ever made the switch to injected medication before (see [24(e)] above). But what is certain is that the appellant has demonstrated a pattern of deliberate non-compliance with his psychiatric medication with the knowledge that doing so could very likely result in violent consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Third, while it is certainly fortunate that the appellant has managed to reconnect with his estranged family, the benefits of this must be tempered with reality. As the DJ cautiously observed, the appellant had been estranged from his family for a lengthy period spanning about 15 to 16 years. It is thus difficult to accept that his elder sister would be in a position to adequately control and guide him in his efforts at rehabilitation and reintegration.

First, it is a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy… Secondly, it exists as a mitigating factor. The cases where ill health will be regarded as a mitigating factor include those which do not fall within the realm of the exceptional but involve markedly disproportionate impact of an imprisonment term on an offender by reason of his ill health. The court takes into account the fact that ill health may render an imprisonment term that will not otherwise be crushing to one offender but may be so to another, and attenuates the sentence accordingly for the latter offender so that it will not be disproportionate to his culpability and physical condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is clear from <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span> that whether the appellant’s medical condition ought to be accorded mitigating weight depends on whether he would face far greater suffering than the usual hardship in serving a term of imprisonment. Such suffering is generally constituted by a risk of significant deterioration in health or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering. In the present case, the Medical Report indicates that he had stage three right kidney cancer which was “completely removed”. Further, as noted above, the Medical Memorandum annexed to the 2nd PD report found the appellant to be of “generally good physical condition” and that he was “suitable” for the PD regime.

</div> Thus, a sentence of PD would not make a difference to the appellant’s state of health or the suffering he would face in prison. Moreover, I would go further to say that the appellant is likely to receive more timely medical intervention whilst in prison seeing as his cancer was first detected in remand and thereafter adequately and expeditiously treated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Further, although the appellant argues that a term of PD would be tantamount to a life sentence after consideration of the five-year survival rate stated above, I find that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the appellant would fall outside of the 60 to 70% survival range. In fact, all the medical evidence at this point suggests that he is in a good physical condition. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Duration of the term of PD </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In relation to the duration of the term of the PD, the DJ found that there was no reason to depart from the length of his previous term of ten years’ PD. I agree. There are no significant protective factors in the appellant’s favour such as those in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v T</span><span class="font-italic">ang Hian Leng </span>[2018] SGDC 180 where the offender had engaged in legal employment, did not resume his illegal drugs consumption habits, stayed away from his anti-social peers, found a partner who engaged in pro-social conventional activities and embraced change through religion, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>., which warranted a decrease in the duration of his term of PD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Ultimately, the duration of the term of PD is guided by the extent to which the public requires protection from the appellant. The appellant has demonstrated that he has yet to genuinely assume responsibility for his conduct as he continually minimises and seeks to justify his violent behaviour. He has not shown a committed effort to address the root cause of his offending, which are mainly his alcohol use and non-compliance with his psychiatric medication. His marked escalation in the severity of his offending as reflected in the present set of violent offences renders it expedient that he be detained for a sufficiently long period of time for the protection of the public. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Having regard to all of the above, the sentence of ten years’ PD cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. I therefore dismiss the appeal.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mato Kotwani (PDLegal LLC) and Ashwin Ganapathy (I.R.B Law LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Niranjan Ranjakunalan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
