        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two consolidated suits in the present
                    proceedings have their roots in an extremely bitter feud between the plaintiff,
                    Mr Kumar Rajaratnam @ Vairamuthu Rajaratnam (“Kumar”), and
                    his elder brother, the second defendant, Dr Bala Saravanamuthu Rajaratnam
                    (“Bala”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In Suit No 438 of 2008, Kumar sought to
                    have his deceased parents’ fourth mutual wills (“the fourth
                    wills”), which were executed on 3 November 2003, set aside. In Suit
                    No 440 of 2008, Kumar sued Bala and the first defendant, Mr Tan Kah
                    Hin (“Mr Tan”), who is the executor of their late
                    father’s estate. He sought a declaration that the fourth wills are null
                    and void and that the defendants give full accounts of the estate of his late
                    father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In his Defence and Counterclaim, Bala sought a
                    declaration invalidating his parents’ third mutual wills (“the
                    third wills”), which were executed on 28 August 2003, around nine
                    weeks before the fourth wills were executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Both brothers also accused each other of
                    exerting undue influence on their parents and of misappropriating their
                    parents’ money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The late Mr Saravana Muthu Rajaratnam
                    (“father”) ran a business, Raja Limb Centre (FE) Pte Ltd, which
                    specialised in artificial limbs, hearing aids and orthopaedic equipment. He was
                    married to the late Mdm Parameswari d/o Vairamuthu
                    (“mother”), who helped him in the administration of his business.
                    The couple (“the parents”) had two children namely, Bala and
                    Kumar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Bala was born in 1956 while Kumar was born in
                    1958. Both of them were sent to Australia for tertiary education in 1980. Bala
                    obtained a degree in Physiotherapy while Kumar obtained a degree in Prosthetics
                    and Orthotics and another degree in Physiotherapy. While Bala returned to
                    Singapore in 1983, Kumar remained in Australia and became a permanent resident
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parents befriended one of their clients,
                    Mr Tan, a lawyer who handled their personal and business legal
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 20 July 2001, the parents executed
                    mutual wills, which were prepared by Mr Tan. The parents had made earlier
                    wills but for convenience, as the wills executed on 20 July 2001 were
                    referred to by the brothers as the “first mutual wills”, they will
                    be referred to as the “first wills” in this judgment. Under the
                    first wills, Bala and Kumar were bequeathed only $500 each and each grandchild
                    was bequeathed $2,000. The balance of the estate of the surviving parent went to
                    a number of named charities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first wills were revoked on 12 October
                    2001 when the parents made their second mutual wills (“second
                    wills”), which were also prepared by Mr Tan. What was different
                    about the second wills was that the executor named in the first wills was not
                    appointed the executor in the second wills and the list of charities that were
                    to benefit was changed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The year 2003 proved to be a particularly
                    tumultuous year for the parents as they had major differences with both their
                    sons over financial matters. By then, the father was a frail man, aged 82, who
                    was suffering from diabetes, hypertension and ischemia. The mother, who was
                    almost 70 years old, had been suffering from Alzheimer’s dementia since
                    2002. She also had breast cancer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 8 March 2003, the father made a police
                    report after discovering that $500 had been withdrawn under suspicious
                    circumstances from a DBS Bank account operated by him, his wife and Bala. The
                    father stated in his police report that he had no suspects in mind. All the
                    same, Bala, who suspected that someone else had taken the money, was upset
                    enough over the missing $500 to write to his parents on 21 March 2003 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With great regret, I write this letter to you to indicate that <em>I wish not to be involved in any of your affairs in
                            future</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The recent incident over a misplaced $500 has highlighted that all my
                        efforts to assist both of you seem to be viewed as negative. This is not the
                        first time and I guess I have lost the energy to continue helping both of
                        you….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">May be it’s because I don’t know how to communicate with both
                        of you, Kumar and your friends. <em>I do not require any
                            materialistic gain from both of you but peace of mind. I humbly ask you
                            to release me from any responsibilities concerning both of
                            you</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Bala had also tried to warn his father about
                    what he perceived as unhealthy influence exercised by some of his father’s
                    friends. On 29 March 2003, his enraged father wrote to him as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please stop all this nonsense and do not interfere in my financial affairs
                        and my relationship with my friends. <em>I have since
                            terminated the account with you as joint partners which I never endorsed
                            in the first place. Your name was included without my
                            permission</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I made the police report on the missing $500 when you
                            refused to accept responsibility for this when you were questioned by me
                            …</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The father forwarded a copy of the above
                    letter to DBS Bank. Why he chose to embarrass his own son by doing this when he
                    had already terminated the account in question cannot be readily
                    understood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The parents also had their share of problems
                    with Kumar. In 1997, the parents had sought the return of $200,000 that Kumar
                    borrowed from them. Kumar insisted that it was not the right time for his
                    parents to take the money out of Australia and that he had better plans to help
                    his parents invest the money. The parents instructed Mr Tan to write to
                    Kumar on 16 July 1997 to demand immediate repayment of the $200,000. The
                    dispute between Kumar and his parents dragged on and on 6 July 1998,
                    Mr Tan wrote to Kumar to say that the parents would like to manage their
                    own retirement funds and that Kumar should refund the $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In 2003, Kumar’s lawyers in Melbourne
                    were apparently preparing legal documents for his parents to sign. It appeared
                    that Kumar’s parents still did not trust him fully as Mr Tan, wrote
                    to Kumar on 22 July 2003 on their instructions as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are instructed that you have instructed your Melbourne solicitors.
                        Messrs Battern Sacks Lawyers, to prepare various legal papers for our
                        clients to sign.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are further instructed to notify you that all legal documents are to be
                        forwarded to us to review and study so that your parents will have proper
                        legal advice thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Despite the above evidence of the
                    parents’ serious differences with Bala and Kumar in the first half of
                    2003, both brothers now claim to have won their trust completely at different
                    times between 28 August to 3 November 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When Kumar was with them on 28 August
                    2003, the parents executed a Power of Attorney to allow him to manage their
                    financial affairs (“the Power of Attorney”). Simultaneously, the
                    parents revoked their second wills and executed the third wills, which clearly
                    favoured Kumar’s children. Kumar then brought his parents to live with him
                    in Melbourne for a few weeks. In October 2003, the parents left Australia for
                    Kuala Lumpur. Kumar arranged for them to stay in a rented house there and an
                    Indian maid was hired for them. Two of the parents’ relatives lived nearby
                    and Kumar entrusted his parents’ passports to a cousin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Bala was quite obviously concerned that his
                    parents had executed the Power of Attorney. On 24 September 2003, his then
                    solicitors, ML Mayeh &amp; Co, wrote to Mr Tan as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We understand that both our client’s parents had executed a Power of
                        Attorney in favour of their other son [Kumar].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly confirm if … both our client’s parents had sought or
                        taken any legal advice from you on the said Power of Attorney which was
                        lodged on or about 28 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, we would also be grateful if you could confirm from your own
                        personal observation whether [the parents] were in the capacity to
                        understand and appreciate such documents on their own if such documents were
                        put before them for their due execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 25 September 2003, Mr Tan replied
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have NO knowledge of the Power of Attorney in favour of their son,
                        Kumar. We have not seen this instrument. We were not consulted
                        thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both parents as far as we can observe are mentally alert and can
                        comprehend our verbal advice and questions. <em>As for their
                            capacity to understand and appreciate a document, we are in no position
                            to advise. We never tested them nor are professionally qualified to do
                            so</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 30 October 2003, Bala went to Kuala
                    Lumpur and managed to escort his parents back to Singapore even though they had
                    no passports with them. The immigration authorities were informed that the
                    parents had lost their passports. Bala checked his parents into St Luke’s
                    Hospital for the Elderly (“St Luke’s Hospital”). On their
                    admission, basic tests were conducted on the parents at the hospital. In
                    relation to the Abbreviated Mental Test (“AMT”), which is a
                    10-item cognitive screening instrument intended to identify cognitive
                    impairment, the father’s score was 7/10 while the mother’s score was
                    only 4/10. It is pertinent to note that the medical summary from St Luke’s
                    Hospital showed that no formal neuropsychological tests were carried out and
                    that both parents could handle most of their basic activities of daily
                    living.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 3 November 2003, just a few days after
                    the parents had checked into St Luke’s hospital, Bala took them to
                    Mr Tan’s office for them to revoke the Power of Attorney and to sign
                    their fourth wills, which gave the bulk of the surviving parent’s estate
                    equally to both Bala and Kumar. Mr Tan was named as the executor in the
                    fourth wills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Alarmed by the turn of events, Kumar
                    threatened Bala in a most unbrotherly fashion in an e-mail on 3 November
                    2003 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I slammed the phone down on you several time as you were meddling and we
                        just wanted to get them to a secure home with us and settle [the parents]
                        down. You could have called them from Singapore but everybody knows you are
                        a cheap skate. You have not bought them a stitch of clothing or a meal. I
                        really feel sorry for you but unfortunately you are my brother and whilst
                        they are alive, I will work with you to keep you honest. You step out of
                        line and you will see my wrath! Now that is a threat and print that out and
                        keep it. … [D]on’t ever lie to me or take 1 red cent out of
                        their account or assist them in selling or purchasing properties or changing
                        their will. It will be the last thing you will do before I make your life
                        totally 100% miserable. That I can guarantee you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Bala continued to take care of the parents in
                    Singapore while Kumar, who remained in Australia, complained that Bala was
                    ill-treating his parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In 2004, the parents’ jointly-owned
                    major assets, a flat at Block 5000D Marine Parade Road #02-13 Singapore 449287
                    (“Laguna flat”) and another flat at Block 20 Chai Chee Road
                    #09-12 Singapore 461020 (“Chai Chee flat”), were sold. The Chai
                    Chee flat was sold on 9 February 2004 for $164,000 and the sale was
                    completed on 16 April 2004. The Laguna flat was sold on 20 October
                    2004 for $355,000 and the sale was completed on 12 January 2005. Bala
                    liaised with the property agents and the bulk of the proceeds of sale were
                    transferred by Bala to himself, allegedly on the father’s instructions.
                    Bala said that the hefty expenses incurred for the upkeep of his parents,
                    including the rental of a flat, the hiring of a maid, food and medical expenses,
                    were paid for by the money he had taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 17 January 2005, the father, then
                    around 84 years old, was appointed the Committee of the Person and Estate of the
                    mother by an Order of Court, which also authorised the father to sell the Laguna
                    flat and required the proceeds of sale to be banked into a specified Maybank
                    account jointly operated by the parents (“the Maybank account”).
                    The court was not informed that the Laguna flat had already been sold and that
                    the proceeds of sale of the Laguna flat had already been banked into a POSB
                    joint account operated by Bala and his mother (“POSB account”).
                    Bala, who knew about the Order of Court, did not place the proceeds of sale of
                    the Laguna flat into the Maybank account. He claimed that he acted on his
                    father’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Although the father had no authority under the
                    Order of Court to give away the mother’s money to anyone, Bala claimed
                    that his father sent Kumar a typewritten letter dated 4 February 2005, in
                    which he informed Kumar that he gave $500,000 to Bala and his wife,
                    Mdm Mythili. Part of the said letter is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With the completion of the earlier sale of Chai Chee for $163,000 &amp;
                        last month, Laguna for $342,449.88, I have gifted Bala with $350,000 for the
                        care of his special need son while Mythili received $150,000 for being a
                        good daughter-in-law and taking care of us all these years….</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A number of points must be noted in relation
                    to the said typewritten letter of 4 February 2005. First, it is evident
                    from the father’s numerous handwritten letters that he had an excellent
                    command of the English language and he would not have made the large number of
                    grammatical errors and spelling mistakes, which are italicised in the paragraph
                    above. Secondly, the father does not know how to type. Bala agreed that someone
                    must have typed the letter for his father, who was by then, so frail that he
                    died four months later. Bala denied that he had typed the letter himself but he
                    could give no indication as to who might have typed the letter. Thirdly, if this
                    was a letter to Kumar, why was there a need to have witnesses sign the letter?
                    Interestingly enough, the two witnesses of these large gifts to Bala and his
                    wife were Bala himself and the parents’ foreign maid,
                    Mdm Nurhidayah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Four months later, on 7 June 2005, the
                    father passed away in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Mr Tan, the executor of the
                    father’s fourth will, filed the Petition of Grant of Probate of the said
                    will. The Grant was made on 29 August 2005. On 16 September 2005,
                    Kumar filed a caveat in the probate proceedings. Instead of following the
                    procedure for contested probate proceedings, on 20 September 2005, Kumar
                    commenced proceedings in the Subordinate Courts to challenge the validity of the
                    fourth wills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Following the death of the father, both
                    brothers were involved in an acrimonious tussle to be appointed the sole
                    committee of the estate and person of their mother. The High Court dismissed
                    Kumar’s application to handle his mother’s affairs and appointed
                    Bala as the sole committee of his mother. Kumar was ordered to pay costs to
                    Bala.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On 28 July 2005, Kumar came to Singapore
                    and went to his mother’s flat but was denied entry by his mother’s
                    maid. According to Kumar, he held his mother’s hands through the locked
                    metal gate of the flat. Bala’s version was that his mother was shocked
                    that Kumar had come to her flat and he was called to the scene. When Bala
                    arrived, there was a scuffle between him and his brother. The police were called
                    and both Bala and Kumar filed complaints in the magistrate’s court against
                    each other. On 1 March 2006, both brothers agreed in the presence of the
                    magistrate to refrain from instituting any criminal or civil proceedings in
                    respect of incident at their mother’s flat on 28 July
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 14 October 2005, the mother was
                    admitted to the Orange Valley Nursing Home, Clementi branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On 18 July 2006, the feud between the
                    brothers took a new turn when Kumar sued Bala for defaming him in an e-mail to
                    their relatives. After one and a half years, Kumar discontinued the
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Kumar also filed Summons No 3038 of 2006,
                    alleging that Bala was ill-treating their mother. On 4 August 2006, VK
                    Rajah J asked for an update on the mother’s medical condition.
                    Kumar’s allegations against Bala proved to be absolutely untrue. In the
                    nursing home’s report to the judge on 10 August 2006, Dr Edwin
                    Lee (“Dr Lee”) stated that Bala “cares for [his
                    mother] well and provides for all her needs” and that Bala took her for
                    all her hospital specialist appointments promptly. He added that Bala and his
                    family visited the mother frequently and supplemented her meals with additional
                    food that they believed would be more palatable to her. Dr Lee also said
                    that it was not uncommon to see Bala walking his mother around and outside the
                    nursing home to keep her physically and mentally active and oriented to her
                    surroundings. On 22 August 2006, the judge noted that Kumar had made
                    unsubstantiated allegations against Bala. Kumar’s counsel then withdrew
                    the application against Bala.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In August 2007, the mother passed
                away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     What is rather alarming is that there is
                    nothing left in the mother’s estate as all her money had been taken away
                    from her before her death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the fourth mutual wills are valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Kumar’s case is as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">His parents were of sound mind when he arranged
                            for them to execute their third wills on 28 August
                        2003;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">However, just nine weeks later on
                            3 November 2003, when the parents executed their fourth wills, they
                            had both lost their mental capacity to execute any will and his mother
                            had suddenly become “partially insane”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The third wills executed by his parents on
                            28 August 2003 contained a provision that the said wills could not
                            be revoked and since his mother was partially insane and had no mental
                            capacity to make a will on 3 November 2003, the mother’s
                            third will had not been validly revoked.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The criterion for testamentary capacity was
                    outlined by Cockburn CJ in Banks v Goodfellow (1869-70) LR
                    5 QB 549 at 565 (“Banks”) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall
                        understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the
                        extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend
                        and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view
                        to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his
                        affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his
                        natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in
                        disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the
                        mind had been sound, would not have been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The question of onus of proof of testamentary
                    capacity was outlined by the Court of Appeal in R Mahendran and another v R
                    Arumuganathan [1999] 2 SLR(R) 166 as follows at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a well-settled principle of law stated as far back as
                        1838 by Baron Parke in Barry v Butlin (1838) 2 Moo 480 at 482 and 484; 12 ER
                        1089 that the legal burden of propounding a will, the <em>onus probandi</em>, lies in every case upon the party propounding
                        the will, “and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the
                        instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable Testator.
                        … it is in general discharged by proof of capacity, and the fact of
                        execution, from which the knowledge of and assent to the contents of the
                        instrument are assumed.” The proposition is framed by <em>Theobald on Wills</em> (15<sup>th</sup>
                        Ed, 2001) at pp 35 to 38 in these terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Burden of proof. The legal (or persuasive) burden of proof always lies
                            upon the person propounding a will to prove that the testator knew and
                            approved of its contents at the relevant time. He must 'satisfy the
                            conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last
                            Will of a free and capable Testator'.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)  Presumption in ordinary circumstances. On proof that
                            the testator was of testamentary capacity and that he duly executed the
                            will, in ordinary circumstances a rebuttable presumption arises that he
                            knew and approved of its contents at the time of execution. The
                            evidential burden of proof then shifts to the person opposing the will
                            to rebut this presumption. If he does so, or if due to the particular
                            circumstances the presumption is not applicable, the person propounding
                            the will must produce affirmative proof of the testator's knowledge and
                            approval so as to satisfy the legal burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)  Suspicious circumstances. If a will was prepared and
                            executed under circumstances which raise a well-grounded suspicion that
                            the will (or some provision in it, such as the residuary gift) did not
                            express the mind of the testator, the will (or that provision) is not
                            admissible to probate unless that suspicion is removed by affirmative
                            proof of the testator's knowledge and approval. A classic instance of
                            suspicious circumstances is where the will was prepared by a person who
                            takes a substantial benefit under it. Another instance is where a person
                            was active in procuring the execution of a will under which he takes a
                            substantial benefit by, for instance, suggesting the terms of the will
                            to the testator and instructing a solicitor chosen by that
                            person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">However circumstances can only raise a suspicion of want of knowledge
                            and approval if they are 'circumstances attending, or at least relevant
                            to, the preparation and execution of the will itself.'</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, Kumar alleged that there
                    were suspicious circumstances as Bala’s handwriting may be found in a
                    draft of the will. However, what is relevant is whether there are suspicious
                    circumstances attending, or at least relevant to, the preparation and execution
                    of the will itself. It is noteworthy that Mr Tan testified that he had
                    discussed the contents of the fourth wills with the parents without Bala being
                    present almost a year before the execution of the said wills. On the day the
                    wills were executed, Mr Tan spoke to the parents when Bala was not in his
                    room. In fact, apart from his secretary, Mr Tan was the only person who
                    attended to the parents when they executed the fourth wills. I thus find that
                    there were no suspicious circumstances attending, or at least relevant to, the
                    preparation and execution of the will itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Undoubtedly, it would have been prudent for
                    Mr Tan to have had the testamentary capacity of the parents assessed by an
                    appropriate medical practitioner before proceeding with the execution of the
                    fourth wills in November 2003. Although this was not done, it does not, without
                    more, mean that the fourth wills are invalid. The function of the court is to
                    decide whether the parents had testamentary capacity at the relevant
                        time<em>, which is 3 November 2003. This
                    inv</em>olves making a finding of fact by applying the law to the
                    evidence: see George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 631 at [64].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     When considering the parents’ mental
                    capacity to execute the fourth will on 3 November 2003, it must be noted at
                    the outset that on 24 August 2003, two days before the third wills were
                    executed, Kumar took his parents to Tay Clinic to be examined by Dr Tay
                    Tiong Hum (“Dr Tay”), who stated in his report as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have examined the above mentioned couple to-day and I find that they are
                        of sound minds. They understand and are able to respond
                        appropriately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Kumar listed Dr Tay as one of his
                    witnesses. Dr Tay was a crucial witness as he could have explained why he
                    regarded the parents as being of sound mind on 24 August 2003 and whether, on
                    the basis of his diagnosis, the parents were likely to have lost their mental
                    capacity only <em>nine weeks</em> after his diagnosis and
                    whether the mother could have, as alleged by Kumar, become partially insane
                    within nine weeks. However, Kumar changed his mind and decided not to call
                    Dr Tay to testify at the trial. No good reason for Kumar’s
                    failure to call Dr Tay was furnished and one might ask whether Kumar was
                    afraid that Dr Tay’s evidence might not advance his case that his
                    parents had no mental capacity to execute their fourth wills some nine weeks
                    after they had been certified as being of sound mind. The fact that Dr Tay
                    was not called to testify allows the court to draw an adverse inference against
                    the party who had listed him as a witness: see <em>Teng Ah Kow
                        and Another v Ho Sek Shiu and Others</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 43. I therefore do so in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Apart from Dr Tay who examined both
                    parents, Kumar’s counsel had also indicated to the Deputy Registrar that
                    he would be calling a number of other doctors to testify at the trial. The
                    witnesses included Dr Yap Keng Bee, a consultant in geriatric medicine at
                    the Alexandra Hospital as well as St Luke Hospital’s two doctors,
                    Dr Colin Ngeow (“Dr Ngeow”) and Dr Fong Ngan Phoon
                    (“Dr Fong”). Dr Yap would have been a useful witness as
                    he examined the mother and issued the following report on 20 September
                    2004, more than 10 months <em>after</em> the fourth will
                    had been executed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [mother] was first brought to see me on

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the clinical examination on

                        expressing herself. <em>There was evidence of marked

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the patient has very obvious features of dementia, probably
                        from Alzheimer’s disease. Her dementia is <em>moderately advanced</em> and is slowly progressing to the late
                        stage of the disease. She is not capable of making informed decisions of her
                        own due to global impairment of her mental functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Regrettably, Kumar again changed his mind and
                    did not call Dr Yap to testify at the trial. He also did not call St Luke
                    Hospital’s Dr Ngeow and Dr Fong. Why Kumar did not call these
                    doctors was not explained to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Instead of relying on the testimony of doctors
                    who had treated his parents, Kumar chose to call Dr Ko Soo Meng
                    (“Dr Ko”), a consultant psychiatrist at Mount Alvernia
                    Medical Centre and an Adjunct Associate Professor with the Department of
                    Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore as a witness. As
                    Dr Ko had not treated the parents, he could only speculate on what could
                    have been the mental capacity of the parents on 3 November 2003 on the
                    basis of the clinical notes and medical reports submitted to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Dr Ko considered the admission medical
                    report of St Luke’s Hospital, which was compiled a few days before the
                    fourth will was executed. He noted that the hospital’s report had stated
                    that the father had a score of 7 out of 10 in an AMT test, which is generally
                    acceptable although he expected a higher score as the father was a Colombo Plan
                    scholar. As for the mother, her AMT score was only 4/10, which Dr Ko
                    considered rather low. In his closing submissions, Kumar laid much emphasis on
                    the fact that the mother’s AMT score was 4/10. However, the AMT is a
                    rather simple test that is easy to perform and score, and while it is one of the
                    best known tests used in general hospitals, there is some controversy as to its
                    intrinsic value. When cross-examined by Bala, Dr Ko accepted that the AMT
                    score gives very basic information about memory and orientation and that it is
                    merely a screening test that is not a diagnosis of a person’s mental
                    capacity. He also explained that ideally, there should have been a variety of
                    tests, including the Elderly Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire and a
                    “mini mental state examination”. There is no evidence that such
                    other tests had been conducted on the parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In his expert assessment report, Dr Ko
                    summed up his findings on the mother as follows:</p>

                            follow-up with the Memory Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital

                            declining condition affecting global mental functions like memory,

                                hill</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While Dr Ko said that the mother’s
                    condition could only go downhill <em>after</em> September
                    2004, what is relevant is whether or not the mother had the requisite mental
                    capacity more than 10 months earlier, on 3 November 2003, to execute her
                    fourth will and not the mother’s condition after September 2004. Referring
                    to Dr Tay’s report on 24 August 2003 that the parents were of
                    sound mind, Dr Ko stated, “I cannot comment because I really
                    don’t know”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Of course, Bala claimed that his parents were
                    capable of executing the wills but his credibility was dented by his testimony
                    and I prefer to look elsewhere for confirmation that the parents had
                    testamentary capacity on 3 November 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In these circumstances, Mr Tan’s
                    evidence is crucial. He was an old friend of the parents and he had been their
                    legal adviser for more than 20 years. He had nothing to gain under the will and
                    he appeared quite saddened by the continuing feud between the children of two of
                    his old friends. He took an even-handed approach with regard to the two brothers
                    and I found him to be a very credible witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It may be recalled that the first two sets of
                    wills prepared by Mr Tan for the parents primarily benefited charities.
                    Apparently, as time passed, the parents had second thoughts and wanted to
                    bequeath their assets to their two sons. Mr Tan testified that the question
                    of changing the wills to benefit Bala and Kumar had been brought up by the
                    parents themselves long before the fourth wills were executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     According to Mr Tan, when the parents met
                    him on 23 November 2002, almost a year before the fourth wills were
                    executed and some nine months <em>before</em> Dr Tay
                    certified that they were of sound mind on 24 August 2003, the father was
                    keen to make a new will to provide for Bala and Kumar. However, the mother
                    hesitated as she wanted to consider the matter further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Subsequently, the parents called on him on
                    11 January 2003 to make new wills to provide for their two sons. However,
                    as they did not have their sons’ identity card numbers, the new wills were
                    not executed on that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On 3 November 2003, the father called
                    Mr Tan to make an appointment to make the long-delayed wills to provide for
                    Bala and Kumar. The fourth wills were executed on that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Tan testified that even if the parents
                    suffered cognitive impairment in November 2003, he was satisfied that the
                    parents were lucid and understood the contents of the fourth wills, which were
                    in line with the previous discussions between Mr Tan and them on
                    23 November 2002 and 11 January 2003. As such, there was no sudden
                    change of intention with respect to the beneficiaries under the fourth
                    wills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     When cross-examined by Kumar’s counsel,
                    Mr Shankar, Mr Tan reiterated that he had spoken to <em>both</em> the parents on 3 November 2003 and that he found that
                    they were not confused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and that they gave him clear
                        instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> When asked why he did not send the parents to a
                    doctor to determine their mental capacity, and especially so since he had stated
                    in his letter to Bala’s former solicitor on 25 September 2003 that he
                    was not professionally qualified to judge whether the parents could understand
                    documents, Mr Tan replied<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t was at the back of mind. You must realise that when they came to see
                        me on the 3<sup>rd</sup> November, right, <em>it was not the first time that they actually raised the issue
                            of changing the will in favour of the two children</em>. So I knew
                        that all along. And so when they came I said, “Look, is this what you
                        wanted?” They said “Yes”…. <em>So
                            I said, “Look, how about the charities?” …. And
                            they said, “We have peace in the family – we will do
                            it”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     When cross-examined by Mr Tan, Dr Ko
                    accepted that while he had doubts about the mental capacity of the mother, the
                    fact that there had been <em>previous</em> discussions
                    between the parents and Mr Tan about changing their previous wills to
                    provide for the two sons may be material for the purpose of determining whether
                    the parents understood what they were doing when they executed their fourth
                    wills although this is a matter of speculation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     After taking all circumstances into account, I
                    accept Mr Tan’s evidence that despite their medical problems, the
                    parents understood what they were doing as well as the terms of the fourth wills
                    when they signed the said wills. After all, the contents of the said wills were
                    not complicated as they essentially involved giving the surviving parent’s
                    property in equal shares to both Bala and Kumar. As such, I hold that the fourth
                    wills were validly executed by the parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is also pertinent to note that the fourth
                    wills are, in any case, valid on the ground that they were prepared in
                    accordance with instructions given by a testator when he or she was of sound
                    mind. In <em>Parker and Another v Felgate and Tilly</em>
                    (1883) 8 PD 171, Sir James Hannen explained at 173 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a person has given instructions to a solicitor to make a will, and the
                        solicitor prepares it in accordance with those instructions, all that is
                        necessary to make it a good will, if executed by the testator, is that he
                        should be able to think thus far, "I gave my solicitor instructions to
                        prepare a will making a certain disposition of my property. I have no doubt
                        that he has g iven effect to my intention, and I accept the document which
                        is put before me as carrying it out."</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In <em>Perera and Others v
                        Perera and Another</em> [1901] AC 354 (“<em>Perera</em>”), the Privy Council endorsed Sir James
                    Hannen’s rule at 362 and regarded it as “good law and good
                    sense”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In <em>Perera</em>, a
                    will was prepared on the basis of instructions given by the testator when he was
                    of sound mind but it was alleged that when the will was read clause by clause to
                    him before it was executed, he was not able to understand its provisions. The
                    Privy Council accepted that the testator was of sound mind when he executed the
                    will. However, it added that since the will had been prepared in accordance with
                    the testator’s instructions when he was of sound mind, it could not be set
                    aside even if the testator was unable to follow all the provisions of his will
                    when it was read over to him before he signed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the present case, the parents gave their
                    instructions to Mr Tan, long before they were certified on 24 August
                    2003 as being of sound mind by Dr Tay. The instructions of the parents were
                    simple enough and entailed bequeathing very small sums to their grandchildren
                    and the remainder of the surviving parent’s estate to both Bala and Kumar
                    in equal shares. Mr Tan prepared the will in accordance with those
                    instructions. I accept that both the parents clearly understood that they were
                    giving effect to their earlier instructions to Mr Tan regarding the
                    disposition of their property when they executed the fourth wills. The only
                    change in the instructions was that the parents now wanted Mr Tan, who did
                    not benefit under the wills, to be appointed the executor. This appointment had
                    nothing to do with the disposition of the parents’ property and I find
                    that the parents, who had appointed executors under their previous wills, fully
                    understood what they were doing when they asked Mr Tan to be the
                    executor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     For the reasons stated, the rule in <em>Perera</em> is applicable and is another basis for holding
                    that the fourth wills are valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Undue influence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I will now consider Kumar’s allegation
                    that Bala exercised undue influence on their parents to persuade them to execute
                    the fourth wills. He asserted that Bala controlled the parents’ minds and
                    knew that in view of their age and deteriorating mental health, his presence
                    would influence them in an undue manner and displace their testamentary
                    intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In contract law, undue influence falls under
                    two categories. The first is actual undue influence while the second is presumed
                    undue influence. The second type of undue influence arises in the case of
                    certain specific relationships, such as between parent and child, doctor and
                    patient, and solicitor and client. Where actual undue influence is alleged, the
                    person who makes the allegation has to prove his case but in the case of
                    presumed undue influence, the person who benefits must rebut the presumption of
                    undue influence. However, in the context of wills, Lord Cranworth explained in
                        <em>Boyse v Rossborough</em> (1857) 6 HL Cas
                    2 at 49 that “once it has been proved that a will has been executed with
                    due solemnities by a person of competent understanding, and apparently a free
                    agent, the [burden] of proving that it was executed under undue influence is on
                    the party who alleges it”. In short, where a will is concerned, undue
                    influence may not be presumed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As for what amounts to undue influence in
                    relation to the execution of a will, the decision of Sir JP Wilde in <em>Hall v Hall</em> (1868) LR
                    1 P &amp; D 481 is taken to stand for the following
                    proposition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Persuasion is not unlawful, but pressure of whatever character if so
                        exerted as to overpower the volition without convincing the judgment of the
                        testator, will constitute undue influence, though no force is either used or
                        threatened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In <em>Wingrove v Wingrove and
                        Others</em> (1885) 11 PD 81, Sir James Hannen stated at 82
                    that “[it] is only when the will of the person who becomes a testator is
                    coerced into doing that which he or she does not desire to do, that it is undue
                    influence”. He added, at 83, that if the testator’s act is shown to
                    be the result of his wish and will at the material time, then, in the absence of
                    fraud, “though you may condemn any person who has endeavoured to persuade
                    and has succeeded in persuading the testator to adopt that view – still it
                    is not undue influence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the present case, Kumar alleged that Bala
                    had a hand in the fourth wills as his handwriting was found on a draft of the
                    said wills. What must be established, however, is that Bala dominated his
                    parents to such an extent that their independence of decision in relation to the
                    execution of the fourth wills was so undermined that his domination caused them
                    to execute the said wills. This is not easy to prove as undue influence in the
                    making of a will is usually proven by the testimony of witnesses present at the
                    execution of the wills or by forensic analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It cannot be overlooked that before the
                    execution of the fourth wills on 3 November 2003, the parents had on
                    23 November 2002 and on 11 January 2003 discussed with Mr Tan the
                    question of making of new wills to provide for their sons. The fourth wills are
                    uncomplicated and their terms are simple enough for the elderly parents to
                    understand. According to Mr Tan, who made it clear that Bala was not with
                    the parents when he spoke to them about the fourth wills, the parents knew what
                    they were doing and they wanted to change their wills to bequeath their property
                    in equal shares to their two sons for the sake of “peace in the
                    family”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     After considering all the evidence, I find
                    that the parents had not been unduly influenced by Bala to execute the fourth
                    wills.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the third wills are valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As I have found that the parents’ fourth
                    wills are valid, it follows that their third wills, even if validly executed,
                    had been revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For the sake of completeness, I will consider
                    whether the third wills were validly executed if the parents’ fourth wills
                    are invalid because they lacked the mental capacity to execute those wills on
                    3 November 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It is rather astounding that Kumar, who
                    asserted so very strongly that his parents lacked testamentary capacity on
                    3 November 2003 when they executed their fourth wills, could simultaneously
                    insist that they had testamentary capacity around nine weeks earlier when they
                    executed their third wills on 28 August 2003 not in the office of their lawyer,
                    Mr Tan, but in the office of a new lawyer, who, more likely than not, was
                    introduced to them by Kumar. If the third wills are valid, one-third of the
                    surviving parent’s estate would be given to charity and Kumar’s
                    children would inherit three-quarters of the balance of the
                estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Like Bala, Kumar’s credibility was
                    dented during the trial. Furthermore, as mentioned, Kumar changed his mind about
                    calling crucial witnesses, namely Dr Tay and other doctors who had examined
                    his parents, to testify. What is noteworthy is that his expert witness,
                    Dr Ko, agreed that if a person with Alzheimer’s dementia lacked
                    testamentary capacity to execute a will on a particular date, he would be
                    “more inclined to believe” that that person did not have the
                    testamentary capacity to execute a previous will some two months before the
                    later will.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He
                    added that he “would be very reluctant” to conclude
                        otherwise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I therefore find that if the parents, and
                    especially the mother, had no mental capacity to execute the fourth wills on 3
                    November 2003, they also had no mental capacity to execute the third wills
                    around nine weeks earlier on 28 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Kumar’s application for the furnishing of accounts to him </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Kumar applied for both Mr Tan and Bala to
                    furnish him with accounts of the parents’ properties. During the trial,
                    his counsel confirmed that no accounts will be sought at this juncture from
                    Mr Tan. As for Kumar’s application for Bala to furnish him with
                    accounts and documents pertaining to the estate of the father, this need not be
                    considered further as it is for Mr Tan, as executor of the parents’
                    wills, to take steps to ensure that money and property that rightly belong to
                    the parents are returned and he must be given sufficient time to consider his
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Bala is entitled to costs. As for Mr Tan,
                    he indicated to the court that he did not require an order for costs to be paid
                    to him.</p>
