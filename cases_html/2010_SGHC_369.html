        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, the plaintiff, who is a
                    successful businessman, is claiming the return of certain sums of money which he
                    avers he lent to the defendant, who is the younger brother of the
                    plaintiff’s ex-wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The claim appears simple enough. However, there
                    are no loan agreements or acknowledgement of these loans either by the
                    defendant, the companies to which the plaintiff issued his cheques or the
                    companies which received payments which the plaintiff asserts represented part
                    repayment of the loans. The relevant companies are incorporated in Singapore,
                    Hong Kong and Indonesia. These companies, the plaintiff’s son, George Yeo
                    Wee Siong (“George Yeo”), his daughter, Yeo Hui Cheng and the
                    defendant were investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department
                    (“CAD”) of the Singapore Police Force. It appears that George Yeo,
                    who had been engaged in these companies, remains out of the jurisdiction and
                    cannot be traced. Arising out of these investigations, 271 charges were
                    initially preferred against the defendant. Subsequently, all charges were
                    dropped save for four charges regarding failures to retain financial records as
                    required by s 199(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), to
                    which he pleaded guilty and paid fines. To compound matters, there looms in the
                    background multiple legal actions between members of the extended family and
                    companies, and an ongoing feud between the plaintiff and his ex-wife with regard
                    to the ancillary matters in their divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties and the relevant companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is a director and the sole
                    shareholder of Glenwood Enterprise Pte Ltd (“Glenwood”) and YSLI
                    Pacific (S) Pte Ltd (“YSLI”). It is not disputed that the
                    plaintiff’s son, Jack Yeo, “owns” Automobil Manufactur (S)
                    Pte Ltd(“ Automobil”) and that the plaintiff’s daughters,
                    Yeo Yee Feng and Yeo Yee Lian “own” Chainford Investment Ltd
                    (“Chainford”). Another of the plaintiff’s daughters, Yeo Hui
                    Cheng (“YHC”) provides clerical assistance to these companies.
                    Then there are Ideo Optical Disc Media Pte Ltd (“Ideo”), Memory
                    Japan (HK) Limited (“Memory Japan”), MJC Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“MJC”) and PT Mega Plast Jayacitra (“Mega Plast”).
                    These companies appear to have been previously managed by George
                Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff gave evidence on his own behalf,
                    and called his daughter, YHC, his nephew, Lim Su Han (“LSH”) and
                    one Ng Sian Tian (“NST”), who worked for MJC and Mega Plast. He
                    also subpoenaed one Diamond Tan Suan Cheok, who is alleged to be in the employ
                    of the defendant. The defendant gave evidence on his own behalf and called no
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The loans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff revealed that the defendant had
                    lived with the plaintiff and his wife from the age of 14 and had been
                    financially supported by the plaintiff. This was confirmed by the defendant. He
                    had on previous occasions lent money to the defendant at the defendant’s
                    request, and the defendant had duly repaid those loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    The plaintiff confirmed that the defendant did not previously borrow very large
                    sums from him but that he loaned the defendant large sums in 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff’s case is that he had lent
                    the defendant various amounts between July and October 2006 totalling $7m as
                    follow:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Copies of the cheques were tendered in evidence and it is not disputed
                    that the cheques were issued by the plaintiff and cleared. What is disputed is
                    that these were loans directly or indirectly to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The crucial issue in this action is the nature
                    of the transactions which underlie these cheques; in particular, whether these
                    were in respect of loans made by the plaintiff to the defendant or for any other
                    purpose or purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is the plaintiff’s case that he made
                    those loans to the defendant, and he relies primarily on his personal cheques as
                    evidence of those loans. The plaintiff admits that there is no evidence of any
                    loan agreement or acknowledgment of the debt from the defendant. The defendant
                    denies that there was any loan to him as averred by the plaintiff. At the
                    outset, it is noteworthy that the plaintiff’s personal cheques were not
                    made out to the defendant but to Glenwood and Mega Plast. Whilst the defendant
                    is sole shareholder of Glenwood, to whom $1.6m was paid, the defendant explains
                    that that transaction was an exchange of cheques. As for all the
                    plaintiff’s other cheques, these were all paid to Mega Plast. Mega Plast
                    was 41% owned by Memory Japan, with the rest owned by an investment arm of the
                    World Bank and some Indonesian parties. The plaintiff’s son George Yeo was
                    previously the managing director and substantial shareholder of Memory Japan.
                    The plaintiff asserts that Mega Plast is controlled by the defendant. However,
                    the precise ownership control or management relationship of the defendant to
                    Mega Plast remains obscure, and in particular there was no evidence produced by
                    the plaintiff to explain why the defendant would borrow from the plaintiff for
                    Mega Plast’s purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Hence, there is only the plaintiff’s own
                    word that his personal cheques were loans that he made to the defendant. Apart
                    from the exchange of the plaintiff’s cheque against the Glenwood cheque,
                    no other cogent or reliable evidence has been adduced in court to corroborate or
                    confirm that these were loans made by the plaintiff to the defendant or that
                    Mega Plast is connected with the defendant in a material way as would explain
                    why this constitutes a loan to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The loan repayments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff next relies on the following
                    payments made by the following companies to the following recipients as evidence
                    of the repayment of the loans he avers he made to the defendant:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of these payments, the plaintiff is claiming the net sum
                    of $2,087,882.00, being the difference between his loans and the payments
                    received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The starting point is that these payments are
                    not payments made directly by the defendant. It is noteworthy, however, that
                    while it was Mega Plast who received the alleged loans, it was not Mega Plast
                    who made these payments. Admittedly, one of the payors is the defendant’s
                    company YSLI. However it made payment only to the extent of $599,975 out of a
                    total of $3,312,118 allegedly owing by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The bulk of the payments originate from Memory
                    Japan and Ideo. It was not clearly established in evidence what exactly was the
                    defendant’s role and interest in these companies at the material time. For
                    Memory Japan, the defendant appears to have been a director and shareholder
                    there for some time but had ceased to be both before the events related to this
                    action. George Yeo was previously the managing director of Memory Japan. The
                    plaintiff alleged that, notwithstanding this, the defendant continued to be
                    involved with Memory Japan. The plaintiff, however, did not specify or
                    substantiate this allegation. Under cross-examination, the plaintiff took
                    varying positions. At first he said that the directors of Memory Japan, Lam Ah
                    Chai and Tan Bee Jin, were nominees of the defendant, on the basis that they
                    were the nominee directors of the defendant in YSLI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Then he
                    said that the defendant was connected to Memory Japan, but was not sure of the
                    nature of this connection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Later on, he added that the defendant
                    controlled Memory Japan based on the CAD investigations, because of what he
                    heard from the persons investigated by the CAD, and the money coming in from
                    Memory Japan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> During cross-examination of the
                    defendant, it was also suggested to the defendant that Tan Bee Jin was his
                    girlfriend and therefore his nominee director in Memory Japan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In
                    reply, the defendant was not forthcoming about his relationship with Tan Bee Jin
                    but denied that she was his nominee. In the circumstances, no reliable or
                    credible evidence was produced by the plaintiff to explain the defendant’s
                    precise relationship with Memory Japan at the material time and to connect the
                    defendant in a material way as would explain why this constitutes a loan to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As for Ideo, LSH deposed that he was a
                    director there at the material time, but alleged he was the nominee of the
                    defendant. He also alleged that Ideo was “not doing anything”, and
                    that the defendant told him to pre-sign and then hand over Ideo’s
                        cheques.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He
                    also identified a cheque dated 10 April 2007 for US$283,000 in favour of
                    Automobil as being an Ideo cheque signed by him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The cheque was said to be the
                    equivalent of $424,493 and a repayment by the defendant. The defendant, for his
                    part, denied knowledge of this payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was
                    also no supporting documentary evidence produced from the books and records of
                    Ideo to substantiate the averred repayment. In the circumstances, no reliable or
                    credible evidence was produced by the plaintiff to explain the defendant’s
                    precise relationship with Ideo at the material time with any and material
                    interest as would explain why this constitutes a loan to him</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The payees of all these payment cheques was
                    Automobil, which is a company admitted to be “owned” by the
                    plaintiff’s son, Jack Yeo. The amounts of these payments do not correspond
                    to the averred loan amounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In sum, the plaintiff’s case is that he
                    lent money and issued his cheques as requested by the defendant, and left it to
                    the defendant to decide when, in what amounts and to whom he would from time to
                    time repay the loans. Neither did he obtain any written acknowledgement of the
                    debt from the defendant nor did he keep any record of the repayments. Apart from
                    the plaintiff’s own AEIC and evidence under cross-examination, no other
                    reliable or credible supporting evidence was produced to support the
                    plaintiff’s case that these inter-company cheques reflected the
                    defendant’s loan repayments and not other purpose or purposes. In
                    particular, there were no clear or unambiguous books, records or accounts
                    produced from the payor or payee companies which reveal and consistently confirm
                    the nature and purpose of the underlying inter-company cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     What little was produced were selective
                    payment vouchers and ledger entries and cheques of Automobil unrelated to these
                    averred loans and repayment to demonstrate that there were some records of other
                    loans involving the defendant. In this regard, YHC was questioned about an
                    Automobil payment voucher and a cheque, both dated 28 March 2007 and
                    written and signed by her for an unrelated payment of S$1,215,000 made to Mega
                    Plast. The payment voucher written by her described the payment as
                    “Company Loan”. Mysteriously, however, there was in evidence
                    another payment voucher which she confirmed was prepared and signed by her
                    relating to the same cheque but this time differently described as
                    “Company Loan (Instruction from Ng Kim Hock to issue cheque to
                    ‘P.T. Megaplast Jayacita’”. She was unable to satisfactorily
                    explain the existence of both payment vouchers relating to the same cheque
                    prepared and signed by her recording different descriptions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I now consider the exchange of cheques. The
                    plaintiff issued a cheque for S$1.6m dated 22 September 2006 payable to
                    Mega Plast. The defendant’s company Glenwood issued a cheque of the same
                    date and amount to Chainford. It was in evidence that the Chainford cheque was
                    first cleared in Glenwood’s bank account on 25 September 2006 and
                    that Glenwood’s cheque was cleared and credited into its bank account on
                    26 September 2006. The defendant explains that this was a simultaneous
                    exchange of cheques agreed between the parties, which entailed the plaintiff
                    making out a cheque to Glenwood on the one part, and Glenwood making out a
                    cheque for an equivalent value to Chainford on the other part, and that the
                    plaintiff would not bank in the Glenwood cheque until his personal cheque had
                    first been cleared into Glenwood’s bank account. The plaintiff’s
                    explanation, however, is that this exchange of cheques was a loan and
                    repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There are several difficulties with the
                    plaintiff’s explanation relating to the exchange of cheques. It was in
                    evidence by the plaintiff that he did not know anything of this payment until
                    June 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> which
                    was when the plaintiff’s solicitors issued a statutory demand to Glenwood
                    for $1.6m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In reply,
                    Glenwood’s solicitors gave the “exchange of cheques”
                        explanation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Under
                    cross-examination, the plaintiff also rhetorically questioned why there was a
                    need to exchange cheques, since he had ample funds which he could transfer to
                    Chainford, his daughters’ company, if needed. I find the plaintiff’s
                    explanation unconvincing. First, I find it difficult to accept that the banking
                    in of $1.6m by Chainford within a few days of the Glenwood same dated and same
                    amount cheque went unnoticed until almost three years later. Next, it is curious
                    why the plaintiff would have originally issued a statutory demand to Glenwood
                    and not the defendant who he now alleges is the true debtor. In any event, the
                    undisputed fact that Glenwood issued and exchanged a same day cheque to
                    Chainford suggests that the exchange of cheques may equally have served other
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The statements, allegations and suggestions
                    and records tendered in court raise larger questions about the precise role of
                    George Yeo and the plaintiff in the conduct of the businesses of these companies
                    and the precise role of the defendant and the reliability of the relevant
                    financial books and records, but these are not matters I need to dwell on in
                    this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I give judgment for the defendant with costs
                    awarded to the defendant which are to be agreed or taxed.</p>
