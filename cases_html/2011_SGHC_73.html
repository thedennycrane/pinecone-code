<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff (referred to in this decision as
                    “the Casino” in some instances) granted the defendant, a
                    Singaporean, credit and issued him $250,000 worth of chips under credit for play
                    at the plaintiff’s premises. Sometime after the chips were fully utilised,
                    the plaintiff claimed for the sums owed. The defendant however, disputes the
                    enforceability of the debt. He claims that he was not a premium player at the
                    time when credit was extended to him. As s108(7) of the Casino Control Act
                    (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CCA”) mandates that the
                    plaintiff can extend credit to a Singapore citizen only if he/she is a premium
                    player, the defendant alleged that the credit extended to him was an
                    unenforceable moneylending transaction under s108(9) of the CCA read with s14(2)
                    of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188). The present dispute therefore centered
                    upon the question of whether the defendant was a premium player as defined under
                    the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CCA”)
                    and the Casino Control (Credit) Regulations 2010 (“Credit
                    Regulations”) at the time when credit was extended to him. The plaintiff
                    applied for summary judgment. I granted leave to defend upon the condition that
                    the defendant pay into court, or provide security by way of a banker’s
                    guarantee, the full amount of the claim (<em>ie</em> the
                    sum of $240,868.00 with interest on the said sum at the annual rate of 12% from
                    14 August 2010 until 25 March 2011 (without prejudice to the
                    plaintiff’s claimed sums as stated in its pleadings)), by 26 April
                    2011, failing which the plaintiff would be at liberty to enter final judgment
                    against the defendant. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       According to the defendant, he visited the
                    plaintiff’s premises to gamble soon after it was opened for
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> After some time, the defendant
                    registered to be a member of the Paiza club on 30 April 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> (gaming date<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>), which is the
                    plaintiff’s exclusive club for its valued patrons. The defendant also
                    enrolled in the Non-Negotiable Chip Rolling Program.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 1 May 2010, at around 5.12am, the
                    defendant paid the plaintiff a sum of $100,000 in cash, and a deposit account
                    was opened in the defendant’s name where the said sum was deposited into
                    the account. According to the plaintiff, this qualified the defendant as a
                    premium player defined under the Casino Control Act (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev
                    Ed) (“CCA”) and the Casino Control (Credit) Regulations 2010
                    (“Credit Regulations”). The plaintiff issued $100,000
                    non-negotiable chips (“NN1 chips”) to the defendant about two
                    minutes later, at around 5.14am. NN1 chips are issued to patrons enrolled in the
                    Non-Negotiable Chip Rolling program; where the patron puts down his bet using
                    the NN1 chips, and any amount that he wins on the bet is paid to him in cash.
                    The net rolling turnover is the difference between the total NN1 chips that were
                    issued to the patron and the total NN1 chips that were returned at the time of
                    settlement after a stipulated maximum period of play. The patron earns a rolling
                    commission on the net rolling turnover which is either paid to the patron by
                    cash, or cash equivalent, or by credit into his deposit account. Shortly after
                    the NN1 chips were issued, the defendant commenced play at around
                        5.35am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The defendant emphasized on the
                    fact that his money balance in the deposit account was “nil” at
                    this point in time when he commenced play. After a few hours, at around 8.09am,
                    the defendant exchanged 75,000 NN1 chips and 25,000 cash chips for $100,000
                    cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequently, the defendant applied for credit
                    from the plaintiff. Sometime between 11pm on 1 May 2010 to 5.59am on
                    2 May 2010, the defendant signed and submitted the plaintiff’s
                    Credit/Cheque Cashing Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) to apply for
                    credit of $1m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This was admitted to by the
                    defendant (save that the defendant does not recall the exact time in which this
                    took place).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant however, claims that the plaintiff made an unsolicited offer of credit
                    to the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He claimed that he applied for
                    credit because he was enticed to do so by one of the plaintiff’s marketing
                        hosts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> After the defendant had applied
                    for credit, he returned to continue his play, with a series of credits and
                    debits made on his deposit account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Although the defendant applied for credit of
                    $1m, the plaintiff approved his credit for a lesser amount of $250,000. The
                    approval was granted on 3 May 2010 at around 1.45am. Subsequently, the
                    plaintiff issued $250,000 worth of NN1 chips on credit to the defendant at
                    around 2.49am on the same day. The defendant emphasized on the fact that the
                    money balance in his deposit account at this point in time was a
                    “nil” balance. The chips issued on credit were fully utilized by a
                    few days later on 9 May 2010. The defendant provided the plaintiff a cheque
                    made payable to the plaintiff, as security for the plaintiff’s issuance of
                    credit to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 13 May 2010, the date when the
                    Non-Negotiable Chip Rolling Program expired, the defendant earned an overall
                    rolling commission of $9,132.00. This amount was credited to the
                    defendant’s deposit account. As such, after this amount was set off from
                    the original principal amount owed (which was the amount of $250,000), the total
                    sum owed to the defendant was $240,868.00. Between 17 June 2010 and
                    8 July 2010, the plaintiff contacted the defendant to make payment of the
                    debt owed. The defendant would inform the plaintiff’s representative that
                    he would try to make payment. Subsequently, the plaintiff presented the
                    defendant’s cheque on 9 July 2010, but the cheque was dishonoured and
                    returned on 12 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Section 108(7)(a) and (b) of the CCA states that
                    the plaintiff may issue chips on credit to a Singaporean or permanent resident
                    only if he/she is a premium player, and if the plaintiff and borrower satisfies
                    the requirements of the relevant controls and procedures approved by the Casino
                    Regulatory Authority (“CRA”) under s 138 of the CCA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7) Notwithstanding anything in this section, a casino operator or a
                        licensed junket promoter may provide chips on credit to a person
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) who is not a citizen or permanent resident of Singapore (as defined in
                        section 116 (9)); or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) who is a premium player,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">if the casino operator or licensed junket promoter (as the case may be)
                        and the person satisfy the requirements of any relevant controls and
                        procedures approved by the Authority under section 138.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 2 of the CCA provides the definition of a “premium
                    player”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"premium player" means a patron of a casino who maintains a deposit
                        account with the casino operator with a credit balance of not less than
                        $100,000 before the commencement of play by him in the casino;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is clear that a patron is a premium player if
                    he maintains a deposit account of not less than $100,000 before the commencement
                    of play. The same requirement is provided in section 3(1) of the Credit
                    Regulations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When patron qualifies as premium player</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.—(1) A patron of a casino qualifies as a premium player of

                        minimum credit balance of $100,000:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) money received by the casino operator from the patron in the form of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Section 108(9)(a) of the CCA provides that the
                    plaintiff would be deemed a moneylender under the Moneylenders Act (Cap. 188,
                    2010 Rev Ed) if it provides chips on credit to a Singapore citizen who is
                    not a premium player. The section is reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(9) Any person who —</p>

                        the Moneylenders Act (Cap. 188)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     If the plaintiff was indeed an unlicensed
                    moneylender, the Credit Agreement and the cheque provided by the defendant would
                    be unenforceable, under section 14(2) of the said Act, which states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where any contract for a loan has been granted by an unlicensed

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Section 2 of the CCA was adopted from s 3
                    of the Australian, Victoria, Casino Control Act 1991 (Act No. 47 of 1991)
                    (“VCCA”). There is no definition of “premium player”
                    provided, but s3 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">premium player arrangement means an arrangement whereby a casino operator
                        agrees to pay a patron of the casino a commission based on the patron's
                        turnover of play in the casino or otherwise calculated by reference to such
                        play</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The understanding of a premium player under
                    the VCCA would be equivalent to a patron who is eligible to enrol into the
                    plaintiff’s Non-Negotiable chip Rolling Program, where the plaintiff would
                    pay the patron a commission on the net rolling turnover. Section 68(8) of the
                    VCCA differs from s108(7) of the CCA, in that the former allows the casino to
                    provide chips on credit to a patron who is not ordinarily resident in Australia
                    in the patron is participating in a premium player arrangement:</p>

                    $100,000 worth of chips to him, just about 2 minutes after when the cash amount
                    of $100,000 was credited into his deposit account. The deposit account remained
                    opened in the defendant’s name, and as shown above, what followed was a
                    series of credits and debits to his deposit account. The defendant argued that
                    because the deposit of monies followed almost immediately with a withdrawal in
                    value of the same amount in chips, it was essentially an exchange of cash for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A relevant principle of statutory
                    interpretation would be that the relevant statutory provision should be
                    construed in accordance to Parliament’s intention <em>as
                        expressed in the language used</em>; this has been described as the
                    “cardinal rule” of statutory interpretation in <em>Craies on Legislation</em> (9<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2008) at 611. The fundamental premise of this
                    principle lies in the assumption that words used in legislation enacted by
                    Parliament are used with precision to reflect its legislative intent. As
                    observed by Lord Reid in <em>Pinner v Everett</em> [1969]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining the meaning of any word or phrase in a statute the first
                        question to ask is always what is the natural or ordinary meaning of that
                        word or phrase in its context in the statute. It is only when that meaning
                        leads to some result which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been the
                        intention of the legislature that it is proper to look for some other
                        possible meaning of the word or phrase.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have been long and deeply impressed with the wisdom of the rule, now, I

                        all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is
                        to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some
                        repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 9A of the Interpretation Act
                    (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation Act”) requires the
                    court to interpret a written law in a way that would promote the purpose of the
                    written law. In my view, the relevant statutory provision should be read in its
                    plain and ordinary meaning <em>in so far as</em> the
                    precise words used reflects Parliament’s intention behind the statutory
                    provision in question. It follows that the plain and ordinary meaning of the
                    words should not be adhered to, if it is shown that the ordinary reading of
                    those words do not reflect Parliament’s intention. This could be done by
                    adducing authority, or by way of reasoning, to show that the plain reading of
                    the words does not purport to resolve the mischief in which the very statutory
                    provision was enacted to resolve. This could also be done by showing that the
                    plain reading of the words would lead to an absurd, illogical or repugnant
                    result. (I add parenthetically that, it would at times be observed that the
                    drafters of the statute intentionally included a phrase or a word which has
                    multiple “ordinary meanings”, to add flexibility in the
                    interpretation of the provision; but that is not the situation in the present
                    case, as shown in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>). A strict adherence
                    to Jacques Derrida’s philosophical assertion that “there is nothing
                    outside of the text” has no place amongst the principles of statutory
                    interpretation, for, as aptly reminded by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in the House
                    of Lords’ decision of <em>R (Quintavalle) v Secretary of
                        State for Health</em> [2003] 2 W.L.R. 692:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The basic task of the court is to ascertain and give effect to the true
                        meaning of what Parliament has said in the enactment to be construed. But
                        that is not to say that attention should be confined and a literal
                        interpretation given to the particular provisions which give rise to
                        difficulty. Such an approach…may…lead to the frustration of
                        [Parliament’s] will, because undue concentration on the minutiae of
                        the enactment may lead to the court to neglect the purpose which Parliament
                        intended to achieve when it enacted the statute…The court’s
                        task, within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to
                        Parliament’s purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Indeed, to insist on the literal reading of
                    the provision despite showing either of the instances stated above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>, would in fact be contrary to the spirit of
                    the cardinal rule; as explained above, the cardinal rule is premised upon the
                    fundamental assumption that the <em>legislative intent</em>
                    is found in the precise words used. If this assumption is shown to be false, the
                    court has to depart from the literal reading. In this regard, the burden lies on
                    the party who asserts that the plain and ordinary meaning of the words should
                    not be followed, to explain why this assumption should be disturbed. As
                    distinctly emphasized by per Lord Hewart C.J in <em>Spiller
                        Ltd v Cardiff (Borough) Assessment Committee</em> [1931]
                    2 K.B. 21 at p 43:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It ought to be the rule, and we are glad to think that it is the rule,
                        that words are used in an Act of Parliament correctly and exactly, and not
                        loosely and inexactly. Upon those who assert that that rule has been broken
                        the burden of establishing their proposition lies heavily. Any they can
                        discharge it only be pointing to something in the context which goes to show
                        that the loose and inexact meaning must be preferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, the phrase “before
                    the commencement of play” in s 2 of the CCA is clear and
                    unambiguous. In particular, the word “<em>before</em>”, used in the context of that phrase, is
                    grammatically capable of one meaning only. A given definition of the word
                    “before” is “during the period of time preceding a
                    particular event or time”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This is
                    diametrically opposed to the word “at”, which has been defined as
                    “expressing the time when an event takes place”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    If the patron is, as asserted by the defendant, required to maintain the sum of
                    $100,000 at the commencement of play, the patron would have to maintain
                        <em>more than</em> the sum of $100,000 <em>before</em> the commencement of play, so that some monies can
                    be exchanged for chips to commence play. This is not set out in the language of
                    the CCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The rationale behind the requirement for the
                    patron to maintain a deposit account of a minimum sum of $100,000 <em>before</em> the commencement of play, under s 108(7) of
                    the CCA, is to ensure that patrons of the Casino will not be able to obtain
                    credit for gambling <em>so easily</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As observed by Associate
                    Professor Ong Soh Khim in the Second Reading of the Casino Control Bill
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                    14 February 2006, vol 80, col 2424):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…clause 108 states that the casino operators may provide credits
                            [<em>sic</em>] to a person who is not a citizen or
                        a permanent resident of Singapore. The casino operators may provide credit
                        to a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore who has maintained a
                        deposit account with the casino operators with a credit balance of not less
                        than $100,000. This stringent requirement is necessary to ensure that
                        patrons will not be able to obtain credit for gambling easily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendant and his counsel did not provide
                    any reasoning or authority (save for an unconvincing reliance on a Parliamentary
                    excerpt, which has been dealt with below at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>-<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>) to show that the
                    rationale of preventing patrons from obtaining credit easily would be defeated
                    by a plain and ordinary reading of the word “before”. The
                    defendant’s counsel argued that, in order to qualify as a premium player,
                    a patron has to maintain the sum of $100,000 either at the commencement of play
                    or immediately before the commencement of play, because the word
                    “before” cannot extent to hours or days before the commencement of
                        play.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> However, this purported situation
                    of a patron establishing a deposit account with an immediate withdrawal of chips
                    of the same value, <em>made days or hours</em> before the
                    commencement of play, was a <em>hypothetical</em> one which
                    defied common sense. It was inexplicable why any patron would leave a
                    substantial amount of monies (in particular, the sum of $100,000) in the
                    Casino’s deposit account, which provides no interest rates, for hours and
                    days without drawing upon the monies to exchange for chips to play in the Casino
                    (in any event, it should be noted that counsel’s hypothetical situation
                    did not apply to the present case, as the defendant maintained a deposit account
                    of not less than $100,000 at around 22 minutes before the commencement of play).
                    The defendant may argue that the patron would benefit from being eligible to
                    apply for credit by simply depositing the sum of monies, and leaving the monies
                    untouched for days without playing at the Casino. This cannot be the case,
                    because, as will be shown later, the relevant rules require the patron to
                    draw-down all the monies in the deposit account before credit can be issued to
                    the plaintiff. In my view, the defendant’s strained construction of the
                    word “before” to create an absurdity which Parliament has not
                    created, based on a hypothetical situation that defies common sense, cannot
                    defeat the plain and ordinary meaning of the word, for that strained
                    construction in itself treads close to being an absurdity. As the defendant
                    failed to disturb the assumption that the precise words used by Parliament
                    reflects its legislative intent, I have no doubt that the defendant, having
                    maintained a deposit account of not less than $100,000 before the commencement
                    of play, was, in accordance with s2 of the CCA, a premium player qualified to
                    obtain credit from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Indeed, the plaintiff’s counsel
                    highlighted how several rules and regulations would support the plain and
                    ordinary reading of s 2 of the CCA. In this regard, he relied on
                    s 9A(2)(a) of the Interpretation Act, which is reproduced as

                    account were drawn-down in exchange for the issuance of chips. Although the
                    defendant found fault with this by arguing that this was an “exchange of
                    chips in the guise of a deposit”, this was in fact entirely consistent

                    that, the patron has to fully utilize all the monies in his deposit account. In
                    the defendant’s view however, the “nil” balance in the
                    deposit account would mean that the patron is not qualified as a premium player
                    and would be ineligible to obtain credit from the plaintiff. Such a view would
                    render it impossible for Singaporean patrons to obtain credit, as compliance
                    with the ICC, the Credit Policy and the Credit Agreement (“the
                    rules”) would prevent the patron from having any monies, much less the
                    minimum sum of $100,000, in the deposit account. Consequently, the
                    defendant’s view would defeat the purpose of s 108(7) of the CCA to
                    enable the extension of credit to Singapore citizens.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the hearing before me, the
                    defendant’s counsel argued that, the rules only require that the amounts
                    in the deposit account be fully utilized <em>before credit is
                        issued</em>, as opposed to before the commencement of play. As such,
                    the defendant’s counsel submitted that to qualify as a premium player, the
                    patron can deposit more than $100,000 to set up the deposit account (for
                    example, a sum of $105,000), draw an amount from the deposit account to exchange
                    for chips before play (for example, the sum of $5,000), but maintaining the sum
                    of $100,000 at the start of play; and after play has commenced but before credit
                    is issued, exchange the rest of the monies in the deposit account ($100,000) for
                    chips to satisfy compliance with the rules (the patron in this hypothetical
                    shall be referred to as “patron A”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The defendant’s counsel did
                    not provide any rationale for such a complicated set of requirements to qualify
                    as a premium player.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The submission made by the defendant’s
                    counsel is tenuous. As explained, the rationale behind the requirement for the
                    patron to maintain a deposit account of a minimum sum of $100,000 before the
                    commencement of play, is to ensure that patrons of the Casino will not be able
                    to obtain credit for gambling so easily. In this regard, both patron A and the
                    defendant in the present case have deposited at least $100,000 into the Casino
                    before the commencement of play. By doing so, they have both shown sufficient
                    financial wherewithal, and hence demonstrated themselves to be credit-worthy
                    enough to be eligible for credit extended by the plaintiff. Furthermore, it is
                    interesting that clause 1 of the Credit Agreement seems to suggest that, as a
                    matter of course, only the sum of $100,000, and not more, is expected to be
                    deposited by patrons who wish to apply for credit, thus rendering the
                    complicated set of requirements (as submitted by the defendant’s counsel)
                    to be highly unlikely. Clause 1 of the standard form Credit Agreement states
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Borrower states that he/she is not a citizen or a permanent resident
                        of Singapore. If the Borrower is a citizen or permanent resident of
                        Singapore, the Borrower attests that the Borrower has deposited SGD $100,000
                        with the Lender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Before I conclude this part of the analysis, I
                    would mention that the defendant’s counsel sought to rely on the following
                    excerpt of Parliamentary Debates to support his position (Second Reading of the
                    Casino Control Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, 14 February 2006, vol 80, col 2312), per
                    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan
                    Seng)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 108 of the bill shall prohibit casino and junket operators from
                        extending credit to Singapore citizens and permanent residents, unless they
                        maintain a credit balance of at least $100,000 with the casino operator
                            <em>at the start of their gaming</em>, which would
                        qualify them as premium players.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Counsel’s citation of the above excerpt
                    provides very little assistance, if any, as counsel did not explain what was
                    meant by “at the start of gaming”. More importantly, counsel did
                    not explain <em>how</em> this phrase was the <em>same</em> as, or <em>different</em>
                    from, the phrase “before the commencement of play” found in s2 of
                    the CCA, and the phrase “period of play” found in section 4
                    of the Credit Regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant provided a second argument: even
                    if the defendant was a premium player on 1 May 2010 (when he set up the
                    deposit account with the minimum sum before he commenced play on that day), his
                    play had expired by 3 May 2010, the day when credit was issued to him. This
                    was allegedly because play had expired when he left the Casino and went home
                    sometime between 1 to 3 May 2010. This argument is dealt with
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the defendant’s play expire by the time he commenced play
                on 3 May 2010 (the same day which credit was extended to him)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant pleaded that he did not qualify
                    as a premium player at the time when the chips of $250,000 was issued to him on
                    credit on 3 May 2010 because:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…he did not have the minimum credit balance of $100,000.00 in his
                        deposit account with the Plaintiff before the commencement of play on

                        credit of $250,000.00 was extended to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In particular, the defendant argued that once
                    a patron stops play at the casino for the day, and leaves the casino’s
                    premises, “play” would expire.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The defendant claimed to have gone
                    home after play on 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> As he left the Casino then, his

                    a new period of play on 3 May 2010 (which was the day that credit was
                    extended to him), the defendant’s balance in his deposit account did not
                    have the minimum amount of $100,000. It was in fact a “nil”
                    balance. As such, it was argued that the defendant did not qualify as a premium
                    player. The defendant’s argument is wholly misconceived, and is premised
                    upon an <em>absurd</em> interpretation of the Credit
                    Regulations. Section 4 of the Credit Regulations provides for the period in
                    which a patron would remain qualified as a premium player, and is reproduced
                    below as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Period when patron remains qualified as premium player</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a patron remains qualified as
                        a premium player of a casino if, upon the expiry of <em>a period of play</em> and before subsequent commencement of
                        a <em>period of play</em> by him in the casino, there
                        is a credit balance of not less than $100,000 in his deposit account
                        with the casino operator of that casino.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The <em>maximum period of play</em> by a
                        patron in a casino shall be a <em>continuous</em>
                        period of one year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A patron ceases to be a premium player if he is no longer
                        qualified as a premium player in accordance with paragraph (1) or upon
                        the closure of the patron’s deposit account with the casino
                        operator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although there is no definition provided for
                    “a period of play”, section 4(2) clearly states that there
                    can be a <em>maximum</em> period of play for a <em>continuous period</em> of one year. As stated above, the
                    defendant’s definition of period of “period of play”
                    depended upon the patron’s presence at the Casino. By the
                    defendant’s definition of “period of play”,
                    section 4(2) would contemplate the <em>absurd</em>
                    situation that a patron can be physically present in the casino for a <em>continuous</em> period of one year. Surely, the drafters of
                    the Credit Regulations could not have intended a definition of “period of
                    play” that would necessitate an absurd reading of section 4(2). In

                        strength of these presumptions depends on the degree to which a particular

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I add parenthetically, that the Court of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In addition to the above, the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The phrase “<em>once
                        established</em>” is particularly pertinent. The Credit Policy
                    provides a clear explanation of section 4(2) of the Credit Regulations,
                    that once a patron’s status as a premium player is established by the
                    maintenance of a minimum sum of $100,000 in a deposit account <em>prior to</em> his commencement of play (in the present case, this
                    took place on 1 May 2010), his status as a premium player is valid for a
                    continuous period of a year, before funds are required to be topped up again (in
                    addition, the patron ceases to be a premium player if his deposit account is
                    closed (see Credit Regulation s4(3)). It is also pertinent that the phrase
                        “<em>prior to</em>” is used, as it
                    clearly reinforces the plain and ordinary meaning of the word
                    “before” in s2 of the CCA. In this regard, it is pertinent that
                    the defendant did not dispute the applicability of the Credit Policy. It was
                    also not disputed that the Credit Policy was submitted to the CRA for
                        consideration,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and was subsequently
                    approved by the CRA under s 138(1) of the CCA on 24 April
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The cheque provided by the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defendant pleaded the untenable position
                    that there was total failure of consideration for the cheque he provided. The
                    defendant had all along admitted that credit was indeed extended to him. What
                    the defendant disputes is to the <em>enforceability</em> of
                    his debt; he does not dispute that chips (that were perfectly playable) of
                    $250,000 in value was issued to him on credit. Indeed, the defendant went as far
                    as to admit that the cheque was “security for the Plaintiff[’s]
                    issuance of credit to the Defendant”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The defendant also pleaded that
                    he drew the cheque under the mistaken belief that payment was or will be due and
                    owing to the plaintiff. This purported mistake of law turned out to be no
                    mistake after all, as I have already shown in the above analysis that the
                    defendant was indeed a premium player at the time when credit was extended to
                    him. The real issue with regard to the defendant’s cheque was whether the
                    cheque, as security for the issuance of credit, was unenforceable under
                    s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act. This consequently depended on whether the
                    defendant was a premium player at the time when credit was extended (this has
                    been dealt with above), and whether the plaintiff satisfied the requirements of
                    the relevant controls and procedures approved by the CRA under s 108(7) of
                    the CCA (this issue will be dealt with below at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>-<a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In arriving at my decision to grant
                    conditional leave to defend, I took into consideration the fact that the
                    defendant’s legal arguments lacked substance (as shown above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>-<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>),
                    and that the <em>bona fides</em> of the defence was highly
                    questionable. I considered the fact that from the time when the defendant had
                    been issued with the chips on credit, to around 8 July 2010, the defendant
                    did not deny that he owed the debt to the plaintiff:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…between 17 June 2010 and 8 July 2010, Mr Pang [the
                        plaintiff’s director of international marketing] had made several
                        telephone calls to the Defendant to request for payment:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a. On 17 June 2010, <em>the Defendant informed
                            Mr Pang that he would go to the Casino within the few days to pay
                            the outstanding amount in cash</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c. On 28 June 2010, the Defendant informed Mr Pang that he had
                        lost monies to another casino…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d. On 2 July 2010, the Defendant informed Mr Pang that he was
                        unable to pay and <em>proposed to sell his car to the
                            Plaintiff in settlement of the outstanding amount</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant responded specifically to the
                    averments made above; but instead of disputing them, he gave a position that was
                    actually consistent with the averments made by the plaintff:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At Paragraph 32 of Oncu’s Affidavit, the Plaintiff claims that I
                        spoke to a Mr. Pang. I do not know who Mr. Pang is. However, I did
                        receive calls from a representative of the Casino asking for payment of the
                        money I allegedly owed to the Plaintiff. I did mention that I <em>would try to make payment</em> but I was unable
                        to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The overall picture is therefore as such: the
                    defendant knowingly applied for credit by signing the Credit Agreement (clause
                    15 expressly states that the applicant is fully aware of the contents of the
                    credit agreement)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>; he was issued with playable chips
                    on credit; he undertook steps to prepare a cheque, which to his own admission
                    and knowledge, acted as security for the plaintiff’s extension of credit;
                    the chips issued on credit were fully utilized, and for about two months
                    thereafter, not only did the defendant not deny that he owed the debt to the
                    plaintiff, he actually informed the plaintiff’s representative that he
                    would <em>try to make payment</em>. Subsequently however,
                    it curiously dawned upon the defendant that he was not a “premium
                    player” as defined under s 2 of the CCA. Viewed in this light, the
                    defence was at best a contrived afterthought, and at worst, a disingenuous
                    attempt to evade payment of a debt legitimately and properly incurred based on a
                    technical argument of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Indeed, the <em>bona
                        fides</em> of the defence was thrown into greater question when
                    arguments based on potentially illegal situations were made to frame purported
                    issues of social concern. The defendant averred that “a friend”
                    handed a cash sum of $100,000 to him, and he deposited the said sum with the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> When
                    the defendant withdrew $100,000 worth of chips immediately after the deposit, he
                    returned the chips to his friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    asserted that he thereafter gambled with his own chips.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>
                    This was apparently corroborated by Ong Lye Huat (“Ong”), a friend
                    of the defendant. Ong stated that “a friend” of theirs had indeed
                    passed the sum of $100,000 in cash to the defendant for him to deposit with the
                    plaintiff, and that the chips issued to the defendant was handed over to the
                        friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The defendant’s counsel
                    argued that if a patron can become a premium player by simply depositing the sum
                    of $100,000 with the plaintiff, a patron could borrow the sum of $100,000 from a
                    friend, gamble a small amount, and return the chips back for cash to return to
                    the friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In such
                    situations, the patron would be deemed a premium player and be able to obtain
                    credit from the Casino easily.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant’s counsel further argued that it may also lead to illegal
                    moneylenders or even bookies lingering at the casino’s premises and
                    offering patrons cash to qualify them as a premium player for the reward of a
                        commission.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As it was not pleaded that the transfer of
                    chips issued on credit to a friend, or the borrowing of monies to finance the
                    minimum deposit sum, would affect the validity of the Credit Agreement or the
                    enforceability of the defendant’s debt (nor was such a connection made in
                    counsel’s arguments), the above assertions do not deserve any more
                    attention than that which has already been given, suffice to say that the
                    clearer legal implications for parties involved in such situations would be
                    those of a <em>criminal</em> nature.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendant did, however, raise a triable
                    issue of fact which should properly be left for determination in trial.
                    According to the defendant, while he was playing at the Casino on 1 May
                    2010, one of the plaintiff’s marketing hosts approached him and offered
                    him to sign up for credit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Although the defendant had apparently
                    rejected the offer, it was alleged that the marketing host told him that there
                    was no harm in signing up for credit as an approved credit line to the defendant
                    will be formed, and the defendant did not have to necessarily use the credit
                        line.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> At this point in time, one of the
                    Casino staff allegedly placed $250,000 worth of chips in front of the patrons,
                    including the defendant, as one of the patrons’ credit line had been
                        approved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> It was alleged that the
                    said patron was told that he could immediately use the chips issued on
                        credit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    defendant, the sight of the chips together with the sales pitch made by the
                    marketing host “enticed” him to sign up for the plaintiff’s
                    credit application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was unclear whether the alleged unsolicited
                    offer of credit was a general offer, or whether it was that of a specific sum.
                    Although the credit application for $1m was made, the actual amount of credit
                    that was approved was $250,000. As stated in <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above, under s 108(7) of the CCA, the plaintiff can
                    issue chips on credit to a Singaporean or permanent resident only if he/she is a
                    premium player, and if the plaintiff satisfies the requirements of the relevant
                    controls and procedures approved by the Casino Regulatory Authority
                    (“CRA”) under s 138 of the CCA. Section 138 of the CCA
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Approved system of controls and procedures to be implemented</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">138.—(1) A casino operator shall not conduct operations in the
                        casino unless the Authority has approved in writing of a system of internal
                        controls and administrative and accounting procedures for the casino.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Any such approval may be amended from time to time as the Authority
                        thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) An approval or amendment of an approval under this section takes
                        effect when notice of it is given in writing to the casino operator
                        concerned, or on a later date specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) The casino operator shall ensure that the system approved for the time
                        being under this section for the casino is implemented.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) Any casino operator who fails to comply with subsection (1) or
                        (4) shall be liable to disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     If the plaintiff had indeed granted
                    unsolicited credit to the defendant, it would have contravened section 6 of
                    the Credit Regulations, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No Unsolicited credit to be granted to patrons</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. A casino operator or a licensed junket promoter shall not-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) provide an amount of chips on credit to a patron or enter into any
                        credit transaction permitted under regulation 5 except on the prior request
                        of the patron; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) provide more chips on credit or grant a higher amount of credit to the
                        patron than the amount of chips or credit requested by the patron.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the hearing before me, the
                    defendant’s counsel submitted that the alleged unsolicited offer of
                    credit, would contravene section 6 of the Credit Regulations, which would
                    mean that the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of the relevant
                    controls and procedures approved by the Casino Regulatory Authority
                    (“CRA”) under s 138 of the CCA. This would in turn mean that
                    the plaintiff could not issue chips on credit under s108(7) of the CCA. The
                    plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that the contravention of section 6 of
                    the Credit Regulations would only attract disciplinary action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> I am unable to accept the
                    plaintiff’s submission. The preamble of the Credit Regulations clearly
                    states that the said regulations were made by the CRA in exercise of its powers
                    conferred under the CCA; thus bringing the Credit Regulations as a system
                    approved by the CRA. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s assertion that it could
                    enforce a debt notwithstanding that the debt had arose from unsolicited
                        credit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> was contrary to the
                    spirit of the CCA, which amongst other purposes, was meant to provide safeguards
                    to protect vulnerable persons from casino gaming (Second Reading of the Casino
                    Control Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, 14
                    February 2006, vol 80, col 2313 at [19]), per Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs
                    (Mr Wong Kan Seng)). In these circumstances, if the defendant was indeed,
                    as alleged by him, enticed to apply for credit, it would affect the legitimacy
                    of the very debt which the plaintiff seeks to enforce. It was therefore
                    important that the defendant’s allegation that he had been offered
                    unsolicited credit was properly investigated in trial.</p>
