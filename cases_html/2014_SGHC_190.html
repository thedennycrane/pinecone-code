<p class="Judg-Heading-1">INTRODUCTION </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No 510 of 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Originating Summons No 510 of 2013 (“OS
                    501/2013”) was filed on 6 June 2013 to remove the sole arbitrator in ARB
                    056/09/MM (“the Arbitration”) administered by the Singapore
                    International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) under the auspices of
                    the 2007 SIAC Rules (“the 2007 Rules”). This challenge was on the
                    basis that there were justifiable grounds to doubt the impartiality of the sole
                    arbitrator, Tay Yu-Jin, (“the Arbitrator”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The removal application was brought by PT
                    Central Investindo (“PTCI”), the respondent in the Arbitration.
                    The claimants in the Arbitration were the first and second defendants in OS
                    510/2013. The first and second defendants were Franciscus Wongso
                    (“FW”) and Chan Shih Mei (“CSM”) respectively. The
                    third defendant was Soekotjo Gunawan (“SG”). For convenience, FW
                    and CSM are collectively referred to in this written decision as “the
                    first two defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       When OS 510/2013 was listed for hearing on 2
                    September 2013, the Arbitrator had yet to issue his award. As OS 510/2013 had
                    been part-heard on 2 September 2013, it was adjourned to a later date to be
                    fixed. During the adjournment, the Arbitrator issued his award dated 4 October
                    2013 (“the Award”). This development prompted the first two
                    defendants to raise a preliminary point at the adjourned hearing on 24 January
                    2014 that an order for the removal of the Arbitrator would serve no meaningful
                    purpose now that he was <em>functus officio</em> having
                    rendered his final award (“the utility argument”), and that the
                    proper course was for PTCI to file a separate application to set aside the
                    Award. Forewarned of the first two defendants’ preliminary objection
                        (<em>ie</em>, the utility argument), PTCI filed Summons
                    No 317 of 2014 (“SUM 317/2014”) on 20 January 2014 for a
                    consequential order to set aside the Award as a matter of right. Objection was
                    also taken by the first two defendants as to the procedural correctness of SUM
                    317/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No 48 of 2014</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Originating Summons No 48 of 2014 (“OS
                    48/2014”) was filed on 17 January 2014. This application was intended to
                    serve as PTCI’s fall-back application should it fail in OS 510/2013 and
                    SUM 317/2014. OS 48/2014 was first listed for hearing on 26 May 2014 together
                    with OS 510/2013 and SUM 317/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The outcome of both applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In both originating summonses, Mr Samuel Chacko
                    (“Mr Chacko”) represented PTCI whilst Mr Chong Yee Leong
                    (“Mr Chong”) represented the first two defendants. The third
                    defendant, SG, was unrepresented and he did not participate in the proceedings
                    that came before me. Mr Chong explained that SG was joined as a party to the
                    proceedings so that any orders made would bind him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As no justifiable doubts as to the
                    Arbitrator’s impartiality was made out in the challenge under Art 13(3)
                    read with Art 12(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
                    Arbitration 1985 (“the Model Law”) as set out in the First
                    Schedule to the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“the IAA”), OS 510/2013 was dismissed with costs to be taxed if
                    not agreed on 26 May 2014. I made no order as to SUM 317/2014. One set of costs
                    was ordered for OS 510/2013 and SUM 317/2014. The hearing of OS 48/2014 was
                    adjourned to 24 July 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       OS 48/2014 was dismissed with costs fixed at
                    $20,000 plus reasonable disbursements on 24 July 2014. PTCI has appealed against
                    my decision in OS 48/2014. I should add that the subject matter of OS 510/2013
                    is not appealable by virtue of Art 13(3) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OUTLINE OF GROUNDS OF DECISION</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In this written decision, the main grounds upon
                    which the two originating summons were argued will be dealt with in turn: OS
                    510/2013 followed by OS 48/2014. It may appear be unorthodox to discuss the
                    subsidiary issues at the end, but I chose to organise my written decision in
                    this way simply because the application to set aside the Award in OS 48/2014
                    under Art 34 of the Model Law was said to depend upon the same matters on which
                    the application in OS 510/2013 to challenge the Arbitrator under Art 13(3) read
                    with Art 12(2) was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first part of this written decision, Part 1,
                    will therefore deal with PTCI’s application in OS 510/2013 to remove the
                    Arbitrator on the basis that there were justifiable grounds to doubt his
                    impartiality. This will be followed in Part 2 by PTCI’s application in OS
                    48/2014 to set aside the Award under Art 34 of the Model Law. Finally, I will
                    discuss by way of <em>obiter</em> the subsidiary points
                    that were raised in OS 510/2013 and SUM 317/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">PART 1: OS 510/2013 </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Removal of the Arbitrator under Art 13(3) read with Art 12(2) of the
                Model Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Article 12(2) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Article 12. Grounds for
                            challenge</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    An arbitrator may be challenged only if
                            circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his
                            impartiality or independence, or if he does not possess qualifications
                            agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed
                            by him, or in whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons of
                            which he becomes aware after the appointment has been
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The question for determination in the present
                    case was whether circumstances existed that gave rise to justifiable doubt with
                    respect to the Arbitrator’s impartiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the heart of the application in OS 510/2013
                    was a set of critical communication exchanges in the context of the first two
                    defendants’ proposed “fresh” claims relating to 200 tower
                    sites that led to the Arbitrator’s so-called directions on 1 and 5 April
                    2013 (“the April directions”). PTCI’s complaint or objection
                    was that the circumstances leading to the April directions and the April
                    directions themselves showed the Arbitrator to be guilty of partiality and that
                    justified his removal as an arbitrator. The main query was whether those
                    circumstances, <em>inter alia</em>, disclosed evidence of
                    apparent bias or partiality, thereby impinging on the Arbitrator’s ability
                    to arrive at a fair and just conclusion in the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Arbitrator’s exchanges in April 2013
                    and the April directions seemed to me to fall short of triggering Art
                    12(2)’s operation. It was even further removed from demonstrating
                    justifiable doubts as to the Arbitrator’s impartiality. As Rix J observed
                    in <em>Laker Airway Inc v FLS Aerospace Ltd and
                        another</em> [2000] 1 WLR 113 at 117 (the Judge’s observations
                    were made in the context of an application under s 24 of the Arbitration Act
                    1996 (c23) (UK) (“UK Arbitration Act”) but they are nonetheless
                    apposite here):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitration is a consensual process and therefore it is perhaps
                        particularly unfortunate that one party should feel any apprehension about
                        the impartiality of an arbitrator. Nevertheless, arbitration would be
                        impossible if one party could require an arbitrator to retire by making
                        unjustified allegation about impartiality or bias. The circumstances in
                        which an arbitrator can be removed are therefore defined in section 24 of
                        the [UK Arbitration] Act. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Like s 24 of the UK Arbitration Act, the test
                    in Art 12(2) is an objective one. The court must find that circumstances exist
                    that justifies one doubting the Arbitrator’s impartiality. Rix J’s
                    application of the test (at 117) is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… An unjustifiable or perhaps unreasonable doubt is not sufficient:
                        it is not enough honestly to say that one has lost confidence in the
                        arbitrator’s impartiality. On the other hand, doubts, if justifiable,
                        are sufficient: it is not necessary to prove actual bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Bias can manifest in three forms: actual bias,
                    imputed bias or apparent bias. Actual bias will obviously disqualify a person
                    from sitting in judgment. The second form of bias is imputed bias which arises
                    where a judge or arbitrator may be said to be acting in his own cause (<em>nemo judex in sua causa</em>) and this happens if he has, for
                    instance, a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the case. In such a case,
                    disqualification is certain without the need to investigate whether there is
                    likelihood or even suspicion of bias. The third form of bias is apparent bias.
                    The allegation against the Arbitrator was that he had been affected by apparent
                    bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was common ground between the parties that
                    the test to be applied for determining apparent bias is the “reasonable
                    suspicion test” as set out by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in
                        <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 85 at [75]–[76] (“<em>Re
                    Shankar</em>”) and earlier by Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) in
                        <em>Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd v Builders Federal (Hong Kong)
                        Ltd and another</em> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 483 at [71]–[72]. The
                    “reasonable suspicion test” was applied by the Court of Appeal to
                    judges in court proceedings in <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v
                        Lee Kuan Yew</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 791 and <em>Tang
                        Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew and another and other appeals</em> [1997] 3
                    SLR(R) 576. There was no dispute that the same test would apply in court
                    proceedings as well as in cases involving arbitrators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The test of apparent bias formulated in
                    Australia is the same except that the Australian High Court changed the
                    statement of principle “reasonable suspicion” to the phrase
                    “reasonable apprehension” to avoid unintended nuances of meaning
                    with the word “suspicion” (see <em>Livesey v New
                        South Wales Bar Association</em> [1983] 151 CLR 288 at
                294).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Applying the reasonable suspicion test to the
                    present case, the relevant enquiry was whether a reasonable and fair-minded
                    person with knowledge of all the relevant facts would entertain a reasonable
                    suspicion that the circumstances leading to the April directions and the April
                    directions themselves might result in the arbitral proceedings against PTCI
                    being affected by apparent bias if the Arbitrator was not removed. The mere fact
                    that PTCI had lost confidence in the Arbitrator would not be justification for
                    his removal (see <em>Yee Hong Pte Ltd v Powen Electrical
                        Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 512 at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Put simply, a two-stage inquiry is undertaken.
                    First, the applicant has to establish the factual circumstances that would have
                    a bearing on the suggestion that the tribunal was or might be seen to be
                    partial. The second inquiry is to then ask whether a hypothetical fair-minded
                    and informed observer would view those circumstances as bearing on the
                    tribunal’s impartiality in the resolution of the dispute before it. In the
                    present case, the main complaint was that the Arbitrator’s April
                    directions gave rise to justifiable doubts as to the Arbitrator’s
                    impartiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Having set out the relevant principles of law,
                    I now turn to the relevant chronology of the events that
                transpired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A chronology of events leading to PTCI’s invitation to the
                Arbitrator to withdraw as arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">October 2009 to 20 May 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For background purposes, I start with the
                    underlying arbitral proceedings, the parties thereto and the progress of the
                    Arbitration up to 20 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     PTCI is a company incorporated in Indonesia.
                    It was at all material times in the business of leasing telecommunication
                    towers. On 2 September 2007, PTCI entered into an Arranger Fee Agreement
                    (“the Arranger Agreement”) with the first two defendants under
                    which PTCI appointed the first two defendants to secure PT Natrindo Telepon
                    Seluler (“NTS”) as a customer to lease its telecommunication
                    towers (“NTS Project”). The Arranger Agreement stipulated that the
                    first two defendants were entitled to an arranger fee pursuant to them securing
                    the NTS Project (“the Arranger Fees”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     SG, the second respondent in the Arbitration
                    and the third defendant named in the present proceedings, was a key
                    representative of PTCI involved in concluding the NTS Project and the Arranger
                    Agreement. He was also a personal guarantor of PTCI for the Arranger
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first two defendants contended that it was
                    through their efforts that PTCI successfully secured the NTS Project in the form
                    of a Preliminary Agreement that was entered into between NTS and PTCI
                    (“the Preliminary Agreement”). Despite numerous demands and
                    reminders, PTCI failed to make payment of the Arranger Fees to the first two
                    defendants of approximately S$250,000 for the 157 telecommunication towers
                    leased by NTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is not necessary for me to mention in
                    further detail the substantive dispute that was referred to the Arbitrator.
                    Suffice to say that the Arbitrator was appointed pursuant to the arbitration
                    clause in the Arranger Agreement on 23 July 2009, and that, between October 2009
                    and March 2011, the parties filed their respective pleadings, witness
                    statements, and hearing memorials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The substantive hearing in the Arbitration
                    took place over a course of three days from 12 April 2011 to 14 April 2011. At
                    the end of the hearing, the Arbitrator issued directions for the filing of the
                    parties’ respective Post- Hearing Memorials and Post-Hearing Reply
                    Memorials. They were duly filed on 6 May 2011 and 20 May 2011 respectively. At
                    that time, there was no indication from the Arbitrator as to when he would issue
                    his award. Over time, the first two defendants grew impatient and their counsel
                    in the Arbitration, Mr Chin Loi Sin (“Mr Chin”), began writing to
                    the Arbitrator, intermittently, to inquire when the parties might expect an
                    award. It was not until 30 November 2012 that the Arbitrator responded with his
                    apology and requested that he be updated on developments. Prior to that, there
                    was an e-mail from the Arbitrator on 27 January 2012 stating that he would let
                    parties know if he required further submissions, but he gave no indication as to
                    when his award would be ready.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">November 2012 to 1 April 2013 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I now turn to the period in time when the
                    Arbitrator sought updates as to the quantum of damages and made consequential
                    directions on supplemental submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 30 November 2012, the Arbitrator apologised
                    for the delay and inquired counsel from both sides as to whether the parties had
                    any further submissions on any points which they wanted to update the Arbitrator
                    on. He wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am conscious of the delay and offer my apologies for it. A
                        telephone conference is not required at this time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, given the time that has elapsed, do the Claimants or the First
                        Respondent have any further submission on any points to update the Tribunal
                        before I render an award?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) the Claimants have any further evidence to adduce in support of
                            their claims for Arranger Fees? and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) can Mr Chin and Mr Chacko please address me on what are the
                            applicable interest rates that should apply (if relevant) to (a) any

                            post-award?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 3 December 2012, Mr Chin, on behalf of the
                    first two defendants, informed the Arbitrator that there was something the
                    claimants in the Arbitration would like to address him on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     PTCI was displeased with the first two
                    defendants’ attempt to “reopen” the arbitral proceedings. On
                    31 December 2012, Legis Point LLC (“Legis Point”) put the
                    Arbitrator on notice of PTCI’s objections to the first two
                    defendants’ attempt to introduce additional submissions or
                        claims:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 1 January 2013, the Arbitrator clarified as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I have not given any party <em>carte

                        that had arisen in the case was the First Respondent’s default in
                        complying with the Tribunal’s directions on document
                        production.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The first two defendants filed their
                    supplemental memorial (“the CSS”) on 29 January 2013 to update the
                    Arbitrator on the matters that had transpired since the Post-Hearing Memorials
                    and Post-Hearing Reply Memorials were filed:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 28 November 2012, the Indonesian
                        Supreme Court held that the SIAC was the competent authority to hear the
                        dispute between the parties (“the Indonesian SC decision”).
                        This ruling arose from PTCI’s original action commenced in the
                        Indonesian courts where it, amongst other things, sought for the Agreement
                        to be declared invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     The first two defendants brought to the
                        Arbitrator’s attention the contradictory positions taken by PTCI in
                        the Arbitration and the Indonesian court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     The first two defendants submitted
                        that in view of the Indonesian SC decision, PTCI should pay the costs
                        incurred by the first two defendants in those
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        first two defendants provided an update on the quantum of the claim for
                        Arranger Fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Upon receiving the CSS, on 30 January 2013,
                    the Arbitrator invited the PTCI to respond to the matters raised therein. The
                    deadline given was two weeks. PTCI felt it was too short and applied for an
                    extension of time on 8 February 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> arguing inequality since the

                    Arbitrator’s e-mail dated 30 November 2012 to file the CSS and that more
                    than 21 months had elapsed since the conclusion of the hearing on 14 April 2011.
                    The Arbitrator agreed to give more time on 13 February 2013, and gave 29 March
                    2013 as the new deadline.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> PTCI filed its supplemental

                    the context of the first two defendants’ proposed “fresh”
                    claim and the events leading to the filing of OS 510/2013 on 6 June
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Chin wrote to the Arbitrator on 1 April
                    2013 at around 2.17pm to give notice of a possible “fresh” claim
                    in the Arbitration. He requested that the Arbitrator “order [PTCI] to
                    confirm whether [it] had sold 200 of its tower sites and to disclose the details
                    pertaining to this transaction.” Mr Chin claimed that if the transaction
                    was “true and was completed”, it would constitute a
                    “fundamental breach” of the Arranger Agreement for the reasons
                    stated in his e-mail.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. The fact that you would issue such Directions within 6 hours of being
                        requested to do so by the Claimant, without affording our client an
                        opportunity to be heard on the matter, and further threatened to draw
                        adverse inference against our client in respect of allegations made by the
                        Claimant, which are neither pleaded, relevant or within the scope of your
                        jurisdiction, is of grave concern to our client.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Our client takes the view that such conduct, apart
                            from being a serious breach of natural justice, also evidences an intent
                            and actual action on your part to enter the arena and actively assist
                            the Claimant in the claims that they have made and intend to
                            make.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    Our client’s views in this regard are
                            fortified by your previous conduct as set out in our email of 31

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Our client is also deeply concerned by the
                            protracted and dilatory manner in which you have conducted this
                            arbitration. The Directions that you have purported to issue is yet
                            another example of the manner in which you have acted to prolong and
                            protract this arbitration unnecessarily and to the prejudice of our
                            client. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Our client is of the view that your aforesaid
                            conduct, when viewed objectively, is such that there is a real
                            likelihood that you cannot and will not be able to fairly determine the
                            relevant issues in this arbitration. Our client has lost all confidence
                            in your ability to act fairly and impartially and has justifiable doubts
                            as to your impartiality and independence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. In light of the above, our instructions are to make the appropriate

                    April 2013 with the SIAC to challenge the appointment of the Arbitrator. The
                    challenge was on broadly the same grounds as that stated in Legis Point’s
                    letter dated 12 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In light of PTCI’s challenge, the first
                    two defendants decided not to complicate matters, and by Mr Chin’s e-mail
                    dated 15 April 2013, they withdrew their application to include the proposed
                    “fresh” claim in the Arbitration, but reserved their rights to
                    refer the “fresh” claim to a separate arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Arbitrator replied on 17 April 2013. He
                    clarified that the 5 April directions “sought and provided [PTCI] with
                    opportunities to respond to the new matters raised by [the first two
                    defendants].” He also added that “no rulings or determinations

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Despite the fact that the First Respondent’s counsel had just filed

                        (namely, April 1, 2013), I received absolutely no response from the First
                        Respondent’s counsel to my directions. Notably, I received no request
                        for extension of time to respond and no objections on grounds of
                        jurisdiction or reservation of rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two days after the deadline that I had directed had passed, without any

                        deadline of April 8. On April 8, I again received no response from the First

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The outcome of application to SIAC to remove the Arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     PTCI’s challenge filed with the SIAC was
                    dismissed by the Chairman of SIAC on 9 May 2013. Dissatisfied with the
                    Chairman’s dismissal, PTCI filed OS 510/2013 pursuant to Art 13(3) of the
                    Model Law and O69A r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application under Art 13(3) of the Model Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     OS 510/2013 was filed on 6 June 2013, and it
                    was served on the Arbitrator on 11 June 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It is trite that Art 12(2) provides that an
                    arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances that “give rise to
                    justifiable doubts as to that arbitrator’s impartiality or
                    independence” exist. Article 13 sets out the procedure for challenging an
                    arbitrator. Article 13(3) provides that the challenged arbitrator is entitled to
                    continue with the arbitration and to render an award pending the removal
                    application – the supervising court has no power under the Model Law to
                    intervene to restrain the arbitrator from continuing with the arbitral
                    proceedings: <em>Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co Ltd v
                        Easton Graham Rush and another</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 14 at
                [37].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Arbitrator issued the Award on 4 October
                    2013 before the determination of the removal application. The Award was not in
                    PTCI’s favour. It was thus hardly surprising that PTCI wished to press on
                    with the removal application at the adjourned hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chong’s submissions on the utility argument </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was argued by Mr Chong at the adjourned
                    hearing on 24 January 2014 that there was no utility in continuing with the
                    challenge because the Arbitrator had become <em>functus
                        officio</em> upon issuance of his final and binding award (see s
                    19B(2) of the IAA). Mr Chong pressed the point that Art 13 was directed at the
                    removal of an arbitrator. Bearing in mind the absence of any general or residual
                    power provided in Art 13(3), the court could not make a declaratory order on the
                    effect of the removal on the Award. He took the position that PTCI should
                    instead proceed to file an application to set aside the Award under Art 34 of
                    the Model and/or s 24 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chacko’s submissions on the utility argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In contrast, Mr Chacko maintained that there
                    was utility in continuing with the application. He argued that the
                    Arbitrator’s partiality was borne out by the adverse Award issued before
                    the determination of OS 510/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discussion and decision on the utility argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I disagreed with Mr Chong. Instead, I agreed
                    with Mr Chacko that OS 510/2013 (which was part-heard) would not, <em>ipso facto</em>, be rendered otiose by the Award. In my view,
                    even though an award had been rendered in the circumstances of this case, a
                    decision in OS 510/2013 had for the following reasons legal, procedural and
                    practical utility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Firstly, the hearing of the challenge can
                    continue as the intention is to disqualify for past breach and to,
                    prospectively, ensure impartiality in the making of the award that was rendered
                    pending the conclusion of OS 510/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Secondly, a decision on an Art 13 challenge is
                    likely to have an effect on any subsequent setting aside application brought
                    under s 24(b) of IAA and Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii), Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) and Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii). I shall deal with the three separate grounds of setting
                    aside and their relation to the requirement of impartiality or independence
                    further below at [111] to [148]. Suffice to say for now that the requirement of
                    impartiality or independence constitutes one of the two pillars of natural
                    justice and any breach thereof may lead to a setting aside of the award under
                        s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Want of impartiality and independence in an
                    arbitral process may also give rise to public policy concerns, and a violation
                    of public policy of Singapore is another ground for setting aside an award under
                    Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law. Additionally,
                    it is said that an arbitrator’s impartiality and independence is mandatory
                    under the Model Law and this is implicit in Art 12(2) of the Model Law: Howard M
                    Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus, <em>A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model
                        Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and
                        Commentary</em> (Kluwer Law and Taxation Publishers, 1989)
                        (“<em>Holtzmann &amp; Neuhaus</em>”) at p
                    409. Apart from the Model Law, the arbitrator’s impartiality and
                    independence in this case is embodied in Rule 9 of the 2007 Rules to form part
                    of the parties’ agreed arbitral procedure. For instance, Rule 9.3
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.3 … Any arbitrator, whether or not nominated by the parties,
                        conducting an arbitration under these Rules shall be and remain at all times
                            <em>independent and impartial</em>. …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Hence, any finding made as to an arbitrator’s
                        impartiality or independence would have a bearing on a setting aside
                        application brought under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of
                        the Model Law with respect to the point that the arbitration was not
                        conducted “in accordance with the Law” or “not in
                        accordance with the agreement of the parties”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Thirdly, a decision made under an Art 13
                    challenge is not appealable whether the challenge is allowed or dismissed (see
                    Art 13(3)). In the event that the challenge is dismissed, a setting aside
                    application that is based on the same grounds raised in the Art 13 challenge
                    will, at the very least, give rise to objections like issue estoppel and abuse
                    of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I note that during the drafting of the Model
                    Law, Norway raised the objection that “an appeal against the court
                    decision should not be precluded, at least not in the case where the court did
                    not agree with the challenge”: <em>Analytical Compilation
                        of Comments by Governments and International Organizations on the Draft Text
                        of a Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</em>
                    (A/CN.9/263, 19 March 1985) (“<em>Analytical Compilation
                        of Comments</em>”) at pp 25–26. In response to this
                    concern, Mr Herrmann from the International Trade Law Branch explained that the
                    reasons behind giving the court’s decision a final and unrepeatable
                    character was that this would minimise delay: <em>Summary Records
                        for the 314th Meeting on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
                        Arbitration</em> (A/CN.9/SR.314, 7 June 1985) at para 27. In fact, the
                    entire procedure under Art 13(3) was adopted as a result of “the fear of
                    considerable delay and dilatory tactics, of disruption and of additional
                    costs”: Peter Binder, <em>International Commercial
                        Arbitration and Conciliation in UNCITRAL Model Law Jurisdictions</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2010) (“<em>Peter
                        Binder</em>”) at para 3–078.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     A court decision that is not appealable may
                    well sieve out and limit subsequent setting aside applications with the
                    concomitant advantage and benefit of curtailing delays, dilatory tactics,
                    disruption and additional costs regardless of whether the court dismisses the
                    challenge before or after the rendering of an award. This also aligns with our
                    courts’ pro-arbitration policy that seeks to avoid “indeterminate
                    challenges” and “indeterminate costs”: see <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [62]. To relate back to Mr
                    Chong’s utility argument, these points demonstrate that a decision on a
                    challenge of an arbitrator made after an award is rendered is not devoid of
                    utility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I now turn to the converse scenario where the
                    Art 13 challenge is upheld. The decision is equally non-appealable. From the
                    viewpoint of the successful applicant, this non-appealable decision has given
                    him a procedural advantage when time comes to set aside the award: the applicant
                    only needs to furnish proof of the court order to support his setting aside
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The procedural advantage under discussion here
                    is quite different from the situation discussed in <em>PT First
                        Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK v Astro Nusantara
                        International BV and others and another appeal</em> [2014] 1 SLR 372
                        (“<em>PT First Media</em>”) at [128].
                    “Instant court control” and “delayed court control”
                    were expressions coined in <em>PT First Media</em>: at
                    [130]. This distinction is helpful when considering the choice of remedies under
                    Art 13 and Art 34. Article 13 is directed at the tribunal whereas Art 34 is
                    against the award. “Instant court control” over pending arbitral
                    proceedings should not give way to “delayed court control” over
                    the award when one party had invoked his choice of remedies under Art 13 and the
                    matter was still pending when the award had been issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Fourthly, even though the Arbitrator may be
                        <em>functus officio</em>, the making of an award merely
                    terminates the arbitral proceedings pursuant to Art 32(1) of the Model Law. It
                    does not terminate the arbitration agreement. Subsequent arbitral proceedings
                    conducted pursuant to the arbitration agreement may take place. For example, the
                    first two defendants may decide to pursue the “fresh” claim raised
                    in Mr Chin’s letter to the Arbitrator dated 1 April 2013 in a separate
                    arbitration (see [35] and [41]). If I were to have made a finding that the
                    Arbitrator should have been removed in OS 510/2013 because of justifiable doubt
                    as to his impartiality or independence (or even for the reason that he lacked
                    the qualifications agreed to by the parties), such an order, regardless of its
                    effect on the award rendered by the Arbitrator, would have had the practical
                    effect of barring the Arbitrator from sitting in future arbitrations between the
                    parties under their arbitration agreement. In addition, if the Award was
                    subsequently set aside for grounds not raised in the challenge of the
                    Arbitrator, there also remained the possibility that “Situation 1”
                    identified by the High Court in <em>L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v
                        Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 1 SLR 1221 at [47] might
                    have occurred where parties had the option of recommencing arbitral proceedings.
                    In such circumstances, a removal order would also have the practical effect of
                    barring the Arbitrator from sitting in the recommenced
                arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Before I move on to deal with the merits of OS
                    510/2013 proper, I have to address a related matter that concerns challenges
                    against an arbitrator heard at different points in time. Notably, the nature of
                    the challenged arbitrator’s conduct necessary to warrant a finding of
                    justifiable doubt as to impartiality will be particular to each case. Hence, any
                    associated level of disquiet about the conduct cannot rise or fall depending on
                    the extent of the arbitration already undertaken and the extent of the
                    disruption that would be caused if a removal of the arbitrator is ordered. These
                    are matters that should not influence the objective test that is to be applied.
                    This is the view of the High Court of New Zealand in <em>Todd
                        Taranaki Limited and Another v Energy Infrastructure Limited and
                        Another</em> [2007] NZHC 1516 at [26] which I adopt. Gary Born in
                        <em>International Commercial Arbitration</em> vol 2
                    (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2014) at pp 1822–1823)
                        (“<em>International Commercial Arbitration</em>
                    vol 2”) accepts that one standard of impartiality applies even at
                    different stages of the arbitral process. His conclusion at the end of the
                    commentary cautioned that there would be a risk that real analysis would be
                    foregone if analysis of whether there are justifiable doubts as to an
                    arbitrator’s impartiality or independence is influenced by the
                    “stage of the arbitral proceedings”. His apposite closing remarks
                    are as follows (at p 1823):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Accordingly, while the procedural posture of the arbitral
                        proceedings can be relevant to decisions regarding the impartiality and
                        independence of arbitrators, it should not be permitted to pre-empt an
                        objective, careful analysis of partiality or bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Removal of the Arbitrator on Art 12(2) grounds</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PTCI’s criticisms of the Arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     PTCI argued that in terms of Art 12(2), there
                    were justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality. Whilst Mr
                    Chacko’s submissions covered events that preceded the April directions,
                    his real focus and complaints of impartiality were based on the critical
                    exchanges of communications relating to the first two defendants’ proposed
                    “fresh” claim and the lead up to the events relevant to OS
                    510/2013. In the context of the critical issue of impartiality, the Arbitration
                    had already been undertaken and the extent of the adverse consequences must
                    arguably be related to the Arbitrator’s ability to come to an impartial
                    conclusion on the substantive issues with the issuance of his award. As Lord
                    Denning MR put it in <em>Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd v C
                        Miskin &amp; Son Ltd</em> [1981] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 135 at 138, it
                    was not a question as to the fitness of the arbitrator to conduct the
                    proceedings but rather whether the arbitrator’s “conduct was such
                    as to destroy the confidence of the parties, or either of them in his ability to
                    come to a fair and just conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     PTCI raised several separate grounds of
                    complaint against the Arbitrator, and I was invited to consider their cumulative
                    effect. The specific complaints or objections were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     There had been a delay in rendering
                        the award up to the time the Arbitrator issued the 1 April
                            direction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Arbitrator had initially given a short timeline of
                        two weeks to PTCI for it to file a response to the CSS filed by the first
                        two defendants on 29 January 2013. It was only after PTCI drew the
                        Arbitrator’s attention to the fact that the first two defendants took
                        two months to file the CSS that the Arbitrator extended a similar timeline
                        to them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Arbitrator had given an unreasonable timeline of one
                        day to PTCI to respond to the “fresh” claim that the first two
                        defendants sought to admit on 1 April 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The direction was issued
                        without giving PTCI a reasonable opportunity to be heard and formed part of
                        the core of PTCI’s challenge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Arbitrator had threatened to draw adverse inferences
                        on the facts asserted by the first two defendants in the
                        “fresh” claim by way of the 5 April direction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Mr Chacko’s contention was that the
                    above complaints or objections against the Arbitrator demonstrated his failure
                    to treat the parties equally and his ignoring PTCI’s right to be heard. Mr
                    Chacko explained that the parties’ reference to the Arbitrator was on the
                    issue of whether the Arranger Agreement was valid and enforceable. The issue of
                    whether there was a fundamental breach was not part of the reference and
                    allowing the first two defendants to raise the issue of fundamental breach in
                    April 2013 without hearing PTCI suggested apparent bias on the
                    Arbitrator’s part: on an objective view, the Arbitrator was assisting the
                    first two defendants in formulating new claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chong’s contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     According to Mr Chong, who represented the
                    first two defendants, PTCI’s reliance on the Arbitrator’s delay and
                    lack of response before the 1 April direction was misplaced. Besides, those
                    specific complaints or objections in [61] above would not give rise to
                    justifiable doubts as to the Arbitrator’s impartiality.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The proper application was for his
                    appointment to be terminated under Art 14 of the Model Law rather than to seek
                    his removal under Art 13 read with Art 12(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Chong relied on the Singapore High Court
                    decision of <em>Kempinski Hotels SA v PT Prima International
                        Development</em> [2011] 4 SLR 633 (“<em>Kempinski (HC)</em>”) <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> which, in the context of a challenge made
                    against the tribunal’s impartiality under s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, held that the arbitrator in that case did not
                    enter into the fray by raising inquiries relevant to the proceedings: at [70].
                    Similarly, in the present case, the 1 April direction was meant for PTCI to
                    respond to the first two defendants’ application to admit a
                    “fresh” claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In any case, just as it was held by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>PT Prima International Development v
                        Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals</em> [2012] 4 SLR 98
                        (“<em>Kempinski (CA)</em>”) at [60], the
                    Arbitrator in the present case had the power to conduct enquiries as may appear
                    to be necessary or expedient under Rule 24.1(e) of the 2007 Rules. Furthermore,
                    the Arbitrator had not made any ruling on the application to admit the potential
                    “fresh” claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Mr Chong further argued that the 5 April
                    direction on the possible drawing of adverse inference was similar to <em>Kempinski (HC)</em>. In that case, Judith Prakash J held that
                    the direction on possible adverse inferences was a direct result of the
                    applicant’s repeated breach of the tribunal’s order for disclosure.
                    Likewise, in the present case, PTCI deliberately chose to remain silent for 11
                    days after the 1 April direction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Even so, the arbitrator did not <em>in fact</em> draw any adverse inferences against
                PTCI.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Discussion of and decision on OS 510/2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For the reasons set out below, justifiable
                    doubts were not made out in terms of Art 12(2), and PTCI’s application for
                    an order that the Arbitrator be removed in OS 510/2013 was dismissed
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PTCI’s complaints did not show that the Arbitrator was
                biased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Whilst Mr Chacko invited this court to take
                    the individual complaints of bias together, the main thrust of his criticism
                    actually related to the purported “fresh” claim raised by the
                    first two defendants on 1 April 2013 and the April directions. It was on the
                    complaints in (c) and (d) of [61] above that Chacko mounted PTCI’s case as
                    to the Arbitrator’s apparent bias. His contentions were that the April
                    directions and the threat to draw adverse inferences against PTCI had been made
                    without affording PTCI an opportunity to be heard and that the
                    Arbitrator’s omissions were “an unmitigated and fundamental breach
                    of the rules of natural justice”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The complaints in (a) and (b) of [61] above
                    were raised in the context of the Arbitrator’s delay in issuing his award
                    and for allegedly “unilaterally inviting the first two defendants to
                    buttress their case long after submissions were made”. If anything, undue
                    delay by itself would not suggest any form of partiality or biasness against
                    PTCI, for <em>both</em> parties were equally affected by
                    the delay before 30 November 2012. There was nothing to the point that the
                    Arbitrator had “invited” the first two defendants on 30 November
                    2012 to adduce further evidence to buttress their claim in an attempt to assuage
                    their unhappiness and ameliorate the delay on the Arbitrator’s
                        part.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Besides, I
                    agreed in principle with Mr Chong that any allegation of a failure to conduct
                    proceedings properly or with reasonable despatch should fall within Art 14 of
                    the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I rejected Mr Chacko’s criticisms of the
                    Arbitrator since the matters (<em>ie</em>, the complaints
                    in (c) and (d) of [61] above) related to and fell within the realm of the case
                    management powers of the tribunal and as such was within the discretion of the
                    Arbitrator to make (see <em>Grand Pacific Holdings Ltd v Pacific
                        China Holdings (in liq)</em> (No 1) [2012] 4 HKLRD 1
                        (“<em>Grand Pacific</em>”). In general
                    terms, there could be no logical reason to differentiate between the proactive
                    case management powers of a judge under our Rules of Court and the proactive
                    case management powers of an arbitrator. The parties here had given the
                    Arbitrator wide and flexible procedural powers by agreeing to the 2007 Rules.
                    Rule 15.2, which obliges the Arbitrator to achieve efficiency and speed in the
                    arbitral process, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers
                        appropriate to ensure the fair, expeditious, economical and final
                        determination of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Mr Chong’s arguments touched on case
                    management, a matter that was entirely within the purview and discretion of the
                    Arbitrator (see <em>Grand Pacific</em> at [68]). In
                    contrast, PTCI’s assertion that it was denied an opportunity to be heard
                    (before the 1 April direction was made and sent to Legis Point) was a bare
                    assertion. It had not shown that it was possible to persuade the Arbitrator not
                    to issue the 1 April direction if prior notice had been given to PTCI. Put
                    another way, PTCI was unable to show that the April directions had not been case
                    management issues. Besides, as case management directions, the April directions
                    were fair and reasonable. They did not manifest any objective lack of
                    impartiality in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In any case, the gravamen of PTCI’s
                    complaint - the April directions - did not
                    give rise to any semblance of biasness or manifest any objective lack of
                    impartiality in the conduct of the arbitral proceedings when considering the
                    train of events from 1 April 2012 leading up to the 5 April direction as a
                    whole. In reality, they were nothing more than the Arbitrator’s attempt to
                    seek information and his second communication took on a sterner tone to convey
                    his impatience and irritation with PTCI’s silence. The complaint was in
                    respect of what may be described as a “stand-alone” procedural
                    matter, and the application to remove the Arbitrator was extreme in the
                    circumstances. Having regard to the overall objective of arbitral proceedings,
                    the supervising court should accord a reasonable margin of appreciation to
                    arbitrators in the discharge of their functions. That said, this instant case is
                    not a borderline case; it was <em>plainly</em> not a case
                    where the Arbitrator had gone wrong in his conduct of the arbitration such that
                    he should be removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PTCI’s complaints about the 1 April direction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As mentioned at [36], the Arbitrator directed
                    PTCI to “confirm or clarify” the first two defendants’
                    factual assertions, namely, that PTCI had sold 200 of its tower sites to NTS.
                    PTCI’s argument was that in making this direction, the Arbitrator did not
                    give PTCI a reasonable opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I was unable to accept this contention. As
                    stated, firstly, it was within the Arbitrator’s case management discretion
                    to issue the 1 April direction. Secondly, the 1 April direction did not prevent
                    PTCI from presenting its position on the matters alleged in Mr Chin’s
                    e-mail. Through the 1 April direction, the Arbitrator was giving PTCI an
                    opportunity to be heard and PTCI was invited to communicate in writing its
                    position on the matters alleged. As Mr Chong correctly submitted, the 1 April
                    direction was precisely intended to allow for PTCI to respond to the first two
                    defendants’ assertion of a “fresh” claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The 1 April direction was in effect an
                    “inquiry” into the matter raised by Mr Chin. The Arbitrator was
                    clearly still in the midst of inquiring into the first two defendants’
                    letter dated 1 April 2013, and had not decided on the matter. Reading the 1
                    April e-mail objectively, no impression could be conveyed that the Arbitrator
                    had prejudged any questions of jurisdiction nor made any determinations. The
                    Arbitrator had merely been urging PTCI to respond to the allegations made by the
                    first two defendants. In this regard, I also noted that PTCI’s lawyers had
                    not written to the Arbitrator to take exception to the 1 April direction any
                    time before the 5 April direction or 12 April 2013 for that
                matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PTCI’s complaints about the 5 April direction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The 5 April direction came after PTCI missed
                    the deadline of 3 April 2013. The Arbitrator had waited until the morning of 5
                    April 2013 before writing to PTCI’s lawyers to present the latter’s
                    position. Through the 5 April direction, he was continuing to give PTCI an
                    opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I disagreed with Mr Chacko that the 5 April
                    direction gave rise to justifiable doubt as to the Arbitrator’s
                    impartiality. It was well within the Arbitrator’s case management powers
                    to draw adverse inferences when faced with a party that ignored his case
                    management decisions. His choice of words was careful, as set out at [37] above.
                    I note that the Arbitrator did not state that he would necessarily draw any
                    adverse inferences; he used the word “may” in his e-mail. That
                    could not reflect partiality on the arbitrator’s part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     As Art 19 of the Model Law stipulates, an
                    arbitrator may conduct the arbitration in such manner as he considers
                    appropriate, including in relation to determining the admissibility, relevance,
                    materiality and weight of any evidence. Mr Chong relied on Rule 24.1(e) of the
                    2007 Rules which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.1  In addition and not in derogation of the powers
                            conferred by any applicable law of the arbitration, the Tribunal shall
                            have the power to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">e.    conduct such enquires as may appear to the Tribunal
                            to be necessary or expedient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In addition, Rule 24.1(o) of the 2007 Rules
                    confers the following power to the arbitrator such that he is allowed to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">o.    proceed with the arbitration notwithstanding the
                                <em>failure or refusal of any party to
                                comply</em> with these Rules, or <em>with the
                                Tribunal’s orders or directions</em> or to attend any
                            meeting or hearing, <em>and to impose such sanctions as
                                the Tribunal deems appropriate</em> … [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Rule 24.1(o) illustrates the point that a party’s
                        failure to comply with an arbitrator’s directions is sufficient reason
                        for the Arbitrator to draw adverse inferences against him. This was the
                        conclusion reached by Prakash J in <em>Kempinski
                            (HC)</em> (upheld in <em>Kempinski (CA)</em>
                        at [56]–[59]). Even though Rule 24.1(o) was not examined in that case,
                        Prakash J held at [71]–[73] that the tribunal’s direction on the
                        possible drawing of adverse inferences could not be faulted because of
                        repeated breaches of its order for disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PTCI’s complaints about the unreasonable timelines </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     PTCI maintained that the one day timeline to
                    respond to the 1 April direction was unreasonable. It was inaccurate to say that
                    only one day was given to them to respond. While it was true that the Arbitrator
                    directed PTCI to respond by 3 April 2013, he had waited until 5 April 2013
                    before sending the e-mail with the direction that he may possibly draw adverse
                    inferences should they continued to remain silent by 8 April 2013. In effect,
                    the Arbitrator had given them seven days to comply with the 1 April
                    direction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As stated above at [18], the reasonable
                    observer is an “informed” individual who takes into account all
                    relevant facts before arriving at a conclusion. In the overall circumstances,
                    the amount of time given to PTCI to comply with the Arbitrator’s
                    direction, in the present case, could not be said to have led a reasonable
                    observer to doubt his impartiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion for Part 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For the reasons stated, OS 510/2013 was
                    dismissed. Consequently, there was no need to make any order sought in relation
                    to PTCI’s application in SUM 317/2014 for a consequential order to have
                    the Award set aside in the event of a successful challenge in OS
                    510/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">PART 2: OS 48/2014</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to set aside the Award </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The application in OS 48/2014 was initially
                    said to have depended upon the same matters on which the application in OS
                    510/2013 to remove the Arbitrator under Art 13(3) read with Art 12(2) was made.
                    The background facts, narrated in [21] to [43] above, provided the necessary
                    context for this application in OS 48/2014. The criticisms of the Arbitrator can
                    be found at [61]–[65] above and the grounds of my decision in OS 510/2013
                    can be found at [66]–[81] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     PTCI’s application to set aside the
                    Award was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Arbitrator was in breach of
                        natural justice in connection with the making of the Award within the
                        meaning of s 24(<em>b</em>) of IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Arbitration was not conducted in
                        accordance the agreement of the parties within the meaning of Art
                            34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Award was contrary to Singapore’s
                        public policy within the meaning of Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii). It was contended that the Award rendered in breach
                        of natural justice on the ground of apparent bias would necessarily conflict
                        with Singapore’s public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It is now a convenient juncture to set out the
                    relevant paragraphs of the Award. Most of the paragraphs were referred to by
                    counsel on both sides. The dispute turned on whether the Preliminary Agreement
                    was concluded by 31 August 2007 or on or after 12 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As noted earlier, the first two defendants
                    were the “Claimants” in the Arbitration. PTCI was the
                    “First Respondent” and SG was the “Second
                    Respondent”. The Arbitration proceeded in default against
                SG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The relevant paragraphs of the Award read as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>

<u>Summary of Facts</u>
<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">213.  This dispute arises essentially from the
                            Claimants’ claims to payment of Arranger Fees (or commission) in
                            return for their assistance rendered to the First Respondent PTCI to
                            procure for PTCI lucrative telecommunication tower contracts from a new
                            client, PT Natrindo Telepon Seluler (“NTS”). The ARA
                                (<em>ie</em>, Arranger Fee Agreement) is the
                            contract which sets out the terms under which the Claimants would be
                            entitled to payment of Arranger Fees from PTCI.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">222.  Under the ARA, the Claimants were to assist PTCI
                            with getting NTS as a customer and, if successful, to assist PTCI with
                            concluding contracts with NTS. The ARA specified three particular
                            contracts that were to be concluded as part of the NTS deal or NTS
                            Project (as defined in the ARA). These agreements were a Preliminary
                            Agreement, a Build Operate and Lease Agreement and a Sale and Leaseback
                            Agreement. The Preliminary Agreement was the precursor agreement to the
                            negotiation and execution of the latter two agreements. Upon the signing
                            of the Preliminary Agreement between NTS and PTCI, NTS would have been
                            treated as PTCI’s customer. Hence, the obligation of the Claimants
                            under the ARA was understood to be to help PTCI procure the Preliminary
                            Agreement and then conclude the latter two agreements (defined in the
                            ARA collectively as the Final Agreement).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">224.  It was not in dispute that PTCI ultimately did
                            successfully procure NTS as a customer and did enter into the relevant
                            agreements with NTS. However, PTCI refused to pay the Claimants any
                            Arranger Fees under the ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">225.  PTCI’s main justification for not paying
                            Arranger Fees was that the Claimants had done nothing to deserve
                            payment. In other words, the First Respondent believed that it had
                            gotten NTS as a customer through its own efforts. The Claimants accused
                            the First Respondent of merely seeking to resile from its obligations
                            under the ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">226.  … On behalf of the First Respondent,
                            [Triandy Gunawan] essentially contended that he had already procured NTS
                            as a client for PTCI <em>before</em> the ARA was
                            signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">227.  The main support that PTCI put forward for this
                            contention was the assertion that the Preliminary Agreement between PTCI
                            and NTS was concluded by August 31, 2007, two days before the ARA was
                            executed with the Claimants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">228.  Triandy Gunawan’s evidence was that the
                            Preliminary Agreement with NTS was already a “done deal”
                            by mid-August 2007 even though the agreement had not been signed by both
                            parties. PTCI also tried to justify this argument by referring to work
                            orders from NTS which referred to a Preliminary Agreement dated August
                            31, 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">229.  Notwithstanding what the work orders stated, the
                            Preliminary Agreement between NTS and PTCI was in fact dated September
                            12, 2007. In the Sale and Leaseback Agreement between NTS and PTCI,
                            reference was also made to the Preliminary Agreement dated September 12,
                            2007. Faced with conflicting evidence as to when the Preliminary
                            Agreement was in fact entered into between NTS and PTCI, I concluded
                            that the Preliminary Agreement was more likely to have been entered into
                            on or after September 12, 2007 as stated on the Preliminary
                            Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">230.  I considered it rather far-fetched that the First
                            and Second Respondents would have rushed to execute the ARA with the
                            Claimants on September 2, 2007 if indeed the First Respondent had
                            already concluded a binding Preliminary Agreement with NTS by mid-August
                            2007 or by August 31, 2007. If the First Respondent was to be believed,
                            NTS would already have been a customer of PTCI by September 2, 2007 and
                            there would have been no need to procure the Claimants’ services
                            through the ARA. When this point was put to Triandy Gunawan during
                            cross-examination, he claimed that the ARA was entered into after a
                            Preliminary Agreement had been concluded between NTS and PTCI because
                            the ARA only concerned <em>additional</em>
                            contracts with NTS (not covered by the Preliminary Agreement) that the
                            Claimants had said they could procure for PTCI. I found this contention
                            by Triandy Gunawan to be inherently unconvincing and his overall
                            credibility to be weak.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">231.  The First Respondent also argued that the
                            Claimants did not provide substantial advice and assistance with regard
                            to concluding relevant contracts with NTS. Again, I found this to be
                            unconvincing against the evidence which showed the Respondents regularly
                            reaching out to the Second Claimant for advice and comments in relation
                            to dealing with NTS. What I found material was the fact that the First
                            Respondent contemporaneously saw the need to refer to the Claimants for
                            advice and such advice was in fact adopted by the First Respondent in
                            its dealings with NTS. In short, the Claimants did assist the First
                            Respondent with procuring NTS as a customer and concluding the necessary
                            contracts with NTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">232.  Under the ARA, the Arranger Fees were to be
                            calculated on the basis of the number of telecommunication towers
                            contracted with NTS. PTCI earned rental fees as well as operations and
                            maintenance fees from the NTS for each tower site. Thus, the Arranger
                            Fees were to be ascertained on the basis of a stipulated commission
                            multiplied by the relevant number of towers.</p>

                            Claimants would not be entitled to their arranger fees because the
                            Claimants could not have been the “effective cause” of

<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">366.  Having considered the arguments of the parties
                            and the written and oral evidence submitted by the Claimants and First
                            Respondent in relation to when the Preliminary Agreement was entered
                            into, I can only conclude that the Preliminary Agreement was entered
                            into on or after its date of execution, September 12,
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">367.  I base my findings on the following reasons.
                            First, on its face, the Preliminary Agreement was dated September 12,
                            2007 by the parties to it – namely, NTS and PTCI. If the agreement
                            was indeed reached by mid-August or by August 31, 2007, and this date
                            was important to PTCI, I would have expected PTCI to ensure that the
                            date of the agreement was accurately stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">368.  Second, the Sale and Leaseback Agreement dated
                            July 7, 2008 between NTS and PTCI (part of the Final Agreement referred
                            to in the ARA) also confirmed and referred to the Preliminary Agreement
                            as being dated September 12, 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">369.  In considering the written and oral evidence of
                            Triandy Gunawan, President Director of PTCI, I found it incredulous that
                            PTCI would rush to enter into an Arranger Fee Agreement (on the terms
                            stipulated therein) with the Claimants on September 2, 2007 if it was
                            indeed the case that, just days before (i.e. August 31, 2007 as asserted
                            by PTCI), PTCI had already procured NTS as a customer on its own
                            merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">370.  Given that the execution of the Preliminary
                            Agreement between PTCI and NTS has been treated by the parties in this
                            arbitration as the first step in establishing that NTS has been obtained
                            or procured as a customer for PTCI, it would have made no sense for PTCI
                            to sign the ARA with the Claimants in which the very NTS Project that
                            the Claimants were to procure for PTCI included signing a Preliminary
                            Agreement with NTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">371.  The First Respondent tried to finesse its
                            argument by contending that it entered into the ARA with the Claimants
                            so that the Claimants could procure additional contracts with NTS for
                            PTCI. However, I did not find this argument or Triandy Gunawan’s
                            evidence on this point convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">372.  Moreover, I considered the timing of the entry
                            into the ARA to be relevant circumstantial evidence. The First
                            Respondent and the Claimants signed the ARA on September 2, 2007, which
                            was a Sunday. If PTCI had indeed reached final agreement with NTS on the
                            Preliminary Agreement on August 31, 2007 (Friday), why would there have
                            been any motivation for the First Respondent to sign the ARA with the
                            Claimants two days later on Sunday?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">373.  Triandy Gunawan, President Director of PTCI and a
                            signatory of the ARA, acknowledged when giving oral evidence that the
                            ARA was signed in a hurry. The Second Claimant, Chan Shih Mei, testified
                            that the reason for the Respondents being in a hurry to sign the ARA
                            was, among other things, because they were worried that the NTS Project
                            deal with NTS would not close. The Second Claimant, who was pregnant at
                            the time, was also about to leave Indonesia for the United States to
                            deliver her baby there. Thus, I heard and I accept the evidence that the
                            ARA was prepared with haste and signed just before the Second Claimant
                            departed Jakarta. Thereafter, as the Claimant which principally gave
                            behind the scenes advice to the Respondents on the negotiations with NTS
                            as a potential customer, the Second Claimant was based in the United
                            States.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">374.  I also considered evidence from the parties
                            regarding the nature of the advice that the Second Claimant rendered to
                            the Respondents in relation to the NTS Project both before and after
                            entry into the ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">375.  Taking the Claimants’ and First
                            Respondent’s submissions into account, I conclude that the
                            Claimants did indeed assist the First Respondent with procuring NTS as a
                            customer insofar as the Claimants were an “effective
                            cause” of PTCI being able to execute the Preliminary Agreement
                            with NTS shortly after the ARA was entered into. Thus, I find that the
                            first aspect of the Claimants’ obligations under the ARA were
                            satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">376.  With regard to the second aspect of the
                            Claimants’ obligations under the ARA – namely, the
                            obligation to assist the Respondents with concluding the relevant
                            agreements that constituted the NTS Project (namely, the Preliminary
                            Agreement, BOL Agreement and Sale and Leaseback Agreement) – on
                            the evidence before me, I find that the Claimants did in fact render
                            assistance to the Respondents to conclude the relevant contracts with
                            NTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">377.  First, it is not in dispute that the relevant
                            contracts (namely, the Preliminary Agreement, the BOL Agreement and the
                            Sale and Leaseback Agreement) were executed by PTCI and NTS, I have
                            already explained why I have found that the Claimants were an effective
                            cause of the Preliminary Agreement being executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">378.  In relation to the BOL Agreement and the Sale and
                            Leaseback Agreement, I find that the Claimants were required by the ARA
                            to “help” the Respondents conclude the agreements. There
                            is no further detail set out in the ARA on the nature or extent of the
                            “help” that had to be rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">379.  As a matter of fact, having heard and considered
                            the written and oral evidence put before me by the parties, I find that
                            the Second Claimant did offer advice and assistance over a prolonged
                            period of time leading up to the signing of both agreements. Some of
                            this advice related to commenting on draft agreements. Other advice
                            related to explanations about the commercial pricing for the agreements
                            based on her past experience working as a Director in NTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">380.  In relation to the First Respondent’s
                            contentions that this advice was commonsensical or simplistic such that
                            it cannot be said to amount to assistance in concluding the contracts, I
                            find these arguments unconvincing. First, the contention is made on
                            highsight. What I consider to be more significant is the fact that the
                            Respondents saw it fit to enter into the ARA with the Claimants, in the
                            first place, and then subsequently draw on the Second Claimant’s
                            expertise and experience during the period when the contracts had not
                            been executed with NTS (namely, at the relevant times in 2007 to
                            2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">381.  If indeed the advice of the Second Claimant was
                            simplistic and unhelpful, the evidential record would not show the
                            Respondents being in regular contact with the Second Claimant over the
                            deal. It would have been open to the Respondents at any time to distance
                            themselves from the Claimants and not share the information relating to
                            the NTS Project if the Respondents felt that they did not require the
                            Claimants’ assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">382.  I also find that the ARA did not establish any
                            thresholds for levels of assistance. The ARA does not require a
                            qualitative or quantitative assessment of the amount of assistance to be
                            rendered or how it should be rendered. In any event, I consider that the
                            assistance given by the Claimants was indeed substantial and treated
                            contemporaneously by the Respondents as sufficiently helpful as to
                            warrant regular contact and requests for assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">383.  Accordingly, I find that the Claimants have also
                            satisfied the second limb of their obligations to “help”
                            the First Respondent conclude the relevant contracts with
                        NTS.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">447.  In relation to the Claimants’ Prayer (i), I
                            find that the arbitration clause in the ARA expressly provides that the
                            losing party in this arbitration shall pay “<em>any</em>” costs and expenses incurred in connection
                            with the arbitration. In light of my findings and determinations on the
                            merits, the Claimants have prevailed substantially in most of their
                            claims on the merits. The Claimants have only lost in relation to their
                            case on jurisdiction against the Second Respondent. In contrast, the
                            First Respondent has failed in its defence on the merits. I am therefore
                            entitled to hold that the First Respondent is the losing party in this
                            arbitration and shall pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in
                            connection with the arbitration.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Mr Chacko in his written submissions
                    identified the rule and breach as follows: (a) a denial of PTCI’s
                    fundamental right to be heard; and (b) the Arbitrator’s apparent bias.
                    However, in oral submissions, his position shifted: he referred to the
                    Arbitrator’s apparent bias and his failure to deal with key submissions
                    and PTCI’s evidence in the Arbitration, contending that the failure to
                    consider PTCI’s evidence was tantamount to not hearing PTCI and was also
                    evidence of apparent bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Apparent bias </p>

                    However, he submitted that this court should evaluate the events after OS
                    510/2013 in light of the following background facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Arbitrator made the April

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a>(c)     the “fresh” claim was
                        outside of the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator and he was acting outside of

                    attempt to recycle and weave the background facts and PTCI’s criticisms of
                    the Arbitrator (see [82] above for the paragraphs) into his arguments to set
                    aside the Award would contradict the outcome of OS 510/2013, in which I decided
                    that the circumstances relied upon by PTCI did not give rise to justifiable
                    doubts of apparent bias on the part of the Arbitrator to warrant his removal as
                    arbitrator. I found the April directions to be case management decisions (see
                    [69] to [80] above) and also found that the two April directions did not
                    manifest the Arbitrator’s intention to admit the “fresh”
                    claim. Eventually, Mr Chin’s idea of raising the “fresh”
                    claim in the Arbitration was dropped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Mr Chacko’s other submission was that
                    the findings in the Award had shown that the Arbitrator had “conducted
                    the Arbitration with a closed mind and in a biased manner’.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> He argued that this court was now free
                    to revisit the issue of apparent bias based on new facts derived from the Award.
                    This was because the new facts showed that the Arbitrator had failed to consider
                    the weight of evidence and that failure was the product of the
                    Arbitrator’s “closed mind” and conduct of the Arbitration in
                    a “biased manner”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the Award was “wholly
                    at odds with the established evidence” in that the Arbitrator had ignored
                    PTCI’s evidence (see <em>TMM (Division Maritime SA de CV v
                        Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 972
                        (“<em>TMM</em>”) at [59(<em>b</em>)(iii)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Mr Chacko also complained that the Arbitrator
                    had not explained why he disregarded PTCI’s evidence, which was as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I agreed with Mr Chong that Mr Chacko’s
                    arguments were baseless. The claim for commission in the Arbitration turned on
                    whether the Preliminary Agreement had been concluded on or after 31 August 2007.
                    The documentary evidence and the Arbitrator’s treatment and evaluation of
                    PTCI’s evidence had been set out in the Award. The Arbitrator had decided
                    that the relevant date was 12 September 2007 and not 31 August 2007, the date
                    which PTCI had argued for and the relevant paragraphs of the Award can be seen
                    at [86] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Mr Chong contended that this case was
                    different from <em>Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 80
                        (“<em>Front Row</em>”) and that Mr
                    Chacko’s reliance on <em>Front Row</em> was
                    misplaced. The decision reached in the Award was perfectly explicable as paras
                    230-232 of the Award had set out the Arbitrator’s reasons for rejecting
                    PTCI’s evidence and paras 366- 374 had provided extensive reasons why the
                    Preliminary Agreement was only concluded on 12 September 2007. Mr Chong also
                    referred me to several paragraphs in <em>TMM</em>, namely,
                    [89], [90], [94] and [96], to show that Mr Chacko’s reliance on <em>Front Row</em> and the criticism of the Arbitrator were
                    non-starters, and that the language used in those paragraphs actually favoured
                    the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I agreed with Mr Chong that an adverse award,
                        <em>in and of itself</em>, could not show bias unless
                    there was some evidence of improper conduct. The reality was that the issue of
                    when the Preliminary Agreement had been concluded was decided in a way not to
                    the satisfaction of PTCI. That could not be evidence of bias. It bears repeating
                    that the substantive merits or the arbitral award are outside the remit of this
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Another instance of apparent bias raised by Mr
                    Chacko was the costs orders made in the Award. The Arbitrator had ordered costs
                    against PTCI on the basis that the Arranger Agreement had provided that the
                    losing party was to bear all costs and expense of the Arbitration. PTCI’s
                    complaint was that the first two defendants should not have been awarded costs
                    in respect of their claim against SG. This was because they had failed in their
                    case against him on jurisdiction. In order words, the Arbitrator was wrong to
                    have awarded the first two defendants full costs of the Arbitration against
                    PTCI. Mr Chacko identified this costs order as an instance of the
                    Arbitrator’s apparent bias against PTCI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I find that there was no merit in this
                    assertion. The Arbitrator has addressed his mind to the issue. He had explained
                    in his Award why PTCI was the losing party at para 447 of the Award: at [86]
                    above. Notably, this court cannot interfere even if there has been an error of
                    law and/or fact on the part of the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Finally, Mr Chacko referred to the power of
                    attorney provision in the Award arguing that it was not a matter that was sought
                    in the Arbitration, and was again another instance of the Arbitrator’s
                    apparent bias. Paragraph 475 of the Award reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>IX. REGISTRATION OF AWARD -
                            POWER OF ATTORNEY</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">475.  The Arbitral Tribunal hereby authorises all of
                            the parties to this arbitration, or any of them, with power of
                            substitution, to act in place of and on behalf of this Arbitral Tribunal
                            to effect registration of this Award with the Clerk of the District
                            Court of Central Jakarta, or with any other court necessary for the
                            purpose of registration or enforcement thereof, in accordance with the
                            provisions of Indonesian Law No.30 of 1999 on Arbitration and
                            Alternative Dispute Resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     There was nothing to this argument and it was
                    a desperate point made in an unmeritorious attempt to find fault with the
                    Arbitrator. There was nothing insidious in the provision of a power attorney in
                    the Award which had been included to facilitate registration or enforcement of
                    the Award in Indonesia. Such a provision was administrative in nature and would
                    be included as a matter of course in any awards intended for registration or
                    enforcement in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Right to be heard</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Another rule of natural justice that was
                    alleged to have been breached was PTCI’s right to be heard. Mr Chacko
                    submitted that the Arbitrator had failed to consider PTCI’s evidence and
                    that was tantamount to not hearing PTCI. Mr Chacko referred to <em>Front Row</em> for the proposition that there would be a
                    breach of natural justice if the tribunal disregards the submissions and
                    arguments made by the parties on the issues without considering the merits
                    thereof: at [37].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I had earlier concluded that the criticism
                    directed at the Arbitrator’s allowing of the first two defendants’
                    claim for Arranger Fees against the weight of the evidence was
                        unfounded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The Arbitrator
                    had found that the Preliminary Agreement was entered into after the Arranger
                    Agreement. The finding was one of mixed fact and law–a finding as to when
                    the Preliminary Agreement was entered into to give it legal binding and
                    enforceable effect–and it was not open to curial intervention under Art
                        34(2)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of Model Law or s 24(b) of the
                    IAA. I repeat that it is trite law that under the IAA, an error of law or
                    erroneous finding of fact made in an arbitral award is not capable of
                    establishing a ground for the award to be set aside (see <em>PT
                        Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                    597 at [57] and recently in <em>BLC and others v BLB and
                        another</em> [2014] SGCA 40 at [102]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arguments on Art 34(2)(a)(iv)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Lastly, Mr Chacko argued that the arbitral
                    procedures had not been complied with. This point harked back to the pre-award
                    matters that had now been overtaken by the outcome of OS 510/2013 (see [81]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arguments on Art 34(2)(b)(ii) </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    PTCI’s argument under Art
                        34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law was that the
                    Award, being rendered in beach of natural justice by reason of the apparent bias
                    of the Arbitrator, would conflict with Singapore’s public policy. However,
                    Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) did not arise for determination
                    since apparent bias was not made out. Besides, error of law or of facts,
                        <em>per se</em>, would not engage the public policy of
                    Singapore under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion for Part 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    For the reasons above, I found that there
                    was really no basis to challenge the Award under s 24 of the IAA or Art 34 of
                    the Model Law. Accordingly, OS 48/2014 was dismissed with costs fixed at $20,000
                    plus reasonable disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">PART 3: SUM 317/2014</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    This section deals with PTCI’s
                    application in SUM 317/2014 for consequential orders in the event of a
                    successful challenge to remove the Arbitrator. Having concluded that
                    PTCI’s application to remove the Arbitrator was without merit, my
                    observations on the matter (without deciding the matters that were raised) are
                        <em>obiter</em> in respect of the supervising
                    court’s powers. The question that arose was: Would disqualification by
                    removal have the consequential effect of annulling or setting aside the final
                    award? Put another way, Mr Chacko’s argument was that the supervising
                    court has the residual power to annul or set aside a final award following a
                    successful application brought under Art 13(3) read with Art 12(2).This
                    interesting issue was argued at some length by counsel and I decided to express
                    some views on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chacko’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Chacko submitted that the supervising
                    court’s power to grant consequential relief which included the annulment
                    or setting aside of the award was ancillary to the court’s primary power
                    to remove an arbitrator. Three arguments were advanced in support of his
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Firstly, it was argued that a contrary
                    proposition would lead to an absurd outcome. Mr Chacko elaborated that an
                    arbitrator manifesting apparent bias could stymie the challenge by issuing his
                    award before a decision was made on the removal application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Secondly, PTCI’s case was premised on
                    unfairness. An award had been issued in the midst of the hearing of the
                    application to remove the arbitrator and the applicant should not be deprived of
                    the advantage of proceeding with the challenge under Art 13(3) where the test of
                    apparent bias in Art 12(2) is said to be less stringent than the requirements
                    set by s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA and the grounds
                    prescribed by Art 34(2) of the Model Law. The latter provisions, as both parties
                    accepted, are arguably more difficult to establish when compared to the
                    “justifiable doubts as to impartiality or independence” ground
                    required to trigger Art 12(2). If the consequential order annulling or
                    invaliding the award was not made available, PTCI would be denied of a remedy
                    that it otherwise would have had but for the issuance of the award in the
                    interim period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Thirdly, Mr Chacko submitted that it could
                    not have been the intention of the drafters of the Model Law to advance the
                    interests of the party opposing the challenge at the expense of the party
                    mounting the challenge. The drafters had tried to reach a middle ground in
                    balancing the tension between (1) preventing undue delay to arbitral proceedings
                    by unmeritorious challenges and (2) preserving the right of a party to challenge
                    an arbitrator. That balance would be disturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Chong’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In contrast, Mr Chong’s arguments were
                    as follows. Article 13(3) of the Model Law did not allow an applicant to seek a
                    consequential order to set aside the Award. The Model Law framework did not
                    provide for any residual powers to the supervisory court, as stated under Art 5
                    of the Model law. Additionally, Art 34(1) provides that the grounds to set aside
                    an arbitral award in Art 34(2) are exclusive grounds. He cited <em>L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and
                        another appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<em>LW
                        Infrastructure (CA)”</em>) as authority for his
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discussion and observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It is expedient to repeat the context of the
                    question for discussion. There was a challenge under Art 13(3), and the
                    challenged arbitrator issued his award prior to a determination of the pending
                    application. If the challenge was successful, did the supervisory court have the
                    power to make a consequential order to declare the award invalid or to set it
                    aside following the removal of the arbitrator? Articles 12 and 13 are silent on
                    this question and neither is the removal of an arbitrator listed as a ground to
                    set aside an award under Art 34(2). Research by counsel indicated that the point
                    in issue remains unresolved. Mr Chong’s submission was that the
                    supervising court does not have the general or residual power to grant any
                    relief other than those prescribed by the Model Law, and that the relief
                    provided in Art 13 is limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    It is uncontroversial under the Model Law
                    framework that the grounds under Art 34(2) are also limited. This position was
                    reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>PT First
                        Media</em> at [66]:</p>

                            couples the term “recourse” with attacks on the award so

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    PTCI accepted that removal of an arbitrator
                    was not a ground listed in Art 34 to set aside the award. According to Mr
                    Chacko, this situation lends support to his contention that an exception should
                    be carved out for Art 13 in that it was the drafters’ intention that the
                    removal of the arbitrator would have the consequential effect of rendering the
                    award a nullity. He pointed to the legislative history of the Model Law to
                    support this contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the drafters intend a successful challenge under Art 13(3) to be
                an additional ground for setting aside an award?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    During the drafting stages of the Model Law,
                    a ground for annulment of an arbitral award after a successful challenge under
                    Art 13 was included in the second draft of Art 34 (originally Art 41 in the
                    second draft) as seen from <em>Draft Articles 37 to 41 on
                        Recognition and Enforcement of Award and Recourse</em>
                    (A/CN.9/WG.II/WP.42, 25 January 1983) (“<em>Draft Articles
                        37 to 41</em>”) at p 94. However, it was taken out along the
                    way and it was not in the final text.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The final decision as to whether it would be
                    retained as a ground to set aside an award under Art 34, however, hinged upon
                    the outcome of a separate debate on Art 13. Footnote 28 accompanying Draft Art
                    41(2) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decision on whether [this ground is] to be retained depends on the
                        final decision of the Working Group on court review of a challenge (see
                        revised draft of article X [Art 13 in the final text] in WP. 40 [an earlier
                        edition of the Second Draft].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Article 13 is the procedure for challenging
                    an arbitrator’s impartiality and independence. The only provision that
                    occasioned considerable and continued debate throughout both the Working
                    Group’s and the Commission’s consideration of Art 13 was para 3,
                    which governs the scope of court intervention in deciding challenges (see
                        <em>Holtzmann &amp; Neuhaus</em> at p 407). A number of
                    alternatives were considered for the most appropriate procedure to adopt for a
                    party dissatisfied with an unsuccessful challenge heard by an arbitral tribunal
                    or any prescribed panel according to the agreed arbitral procedure pursuant to
                    paras 1 to 2 of Art 13 to seek court review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    By the completion of the third draft of Art
                    13 (originally Art X in the third draft, the Working Group had whittled down the
                    various suggestions to two broad alternatives as seen in <em>Redrafted Articles I to XII on Scope of Application, General Provisions,
                        Arbitration Agreement and the Courts, and Composition of Arbitral
                        Tribunal</em> (A/CN.9/WG.II/WP/45, 13 June 1983) at p 186. The first
                    alternative allows the challenging party, upon an unsuccessful challenge, to
                    “pursue his objections before a court only in an action for setting aside
                    the arbitral award.” The second alternative allows the challenging party
                    to, within 15 days of an unsuccessful challenge, request a decision from the
                    court and that while a decision is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue
                    the arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Divergent views were expressed concerning
                    both alternatives in the <em>Report of the Working Group on the
                        Work of its Sixth Session</em> (A/CN.9/245, 22 September 1983)
                        (“<em>Report of the Working Group on its Sixth
                        Session</em>”) at paras 209-211. Proponents of the first
                    alternative argued that it would prevent dilatory tactics, although it was also
                    recognised by some that the revised version of the second alternative (which
                    allows the arbitral tribunal to continue arbitral proceedings pending the
                    court’s decision on the challenge) alleviated the concerns. At one stage,
                    it was suggested that the second alternative should be adopted but without its
                    last part which allowed the arbitral tribunal to continue the proceedings while
                    the question of challenge was pending a court decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Finally, the Working Group, recognising the
                    concerns of both camps, decided to adopt “a compromise solution”.
                    It provided for court intervention during the arbitral proceedings, but with
                    three features designed to minimise the risk and adverse effects of dilatory
                    tactics. The three features as noted in the <em>Analytical
                        Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International Commercial
                        Arbitration</em> (A/CN.9/264, 25 March 1985) (“<em>Analytical Commentary</em>”) at p 33 are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The first element is the short period of time of fifteen days for
                        requesting the Court to overrule the negative decision of the arbitral
                        tribunal or any other body agreed upon by the parties. The second feature is
                        that the decision by the Court shall be final; in addition to excluding
                        appeal … The third feature is that the arbitral tribunal, including
                        the challenged arbitrator, may continue the arbitral proceedings while the
                        request is pending with the Court; it would certainly do so, if it regards
                        the challenge as totally unfounded and serving merely dilatory
                        purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Returning to Art 34(2), the adoption of the
                    second alternative to Art 13(3) paved the way for the removal of an arbitrator
                    on grounds that that mirrored Art 12(2) (“the proposed ground”).
                    According to the drafters, this ground under Art 34(2) (original Art XXX) in the
                    third draft) would “not be necessary” if the Working Group were to
                    decide “in favour of the second alternative set forth in [Art
                    13(3)]” (<em>Revised Draft Articles XXV to XXX Third
                        Draft</em> (A/CN.9/WG.II/WP.46) (13 June 1983), Section K at footnote
                    14). The same was said in the <em>Report of the Working Group on
                        I</em>nternational <em>C</em>ontract <em>P</em>ractices on the <em>W</em>ork of
                    its <em>S</em>ixth <em>S</em>ession
                    (A/CN.9/245, 29 August 1983–9 September 1983) at para 152, where it had
                    been noted that this ground “was not needed if the Working Group would
                    adopt the second alternative in [Art 13(3)].”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    There was little in the Working
                    Group’s report on setting aside of the award following the removal of the
                    arbitrator in the sequential likeness of the present case. One could arguably
                    read and interpret the eventual framework adopted by the Working Group in three
                    ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first is that the removal of an
                        arbitrator would necessarily render the award to be of no effect, and
                        therefore it was unnecessary to expressly provide for it as a ground to set
                        aside the award under Art 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second is that the drafters did not quite anticipate
                        the present scenario where an award would be rendered before the
                        court’s decision on the challenge. Given the fifteen-day and
                        thirty-day timelines contained in Art 13(2) and Art 13(3) respectively,
                        challenges against the arbitrator would in all likelihood be during the
                        early stages of arbitral proceedings, and that there is a lacuna in the
                        Model Law as result of the failure to contemplate the occurrence of a
                        situation such as that in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third is that the removal of an arbitrator
                        allows for the setting aside of an award under one of the grounds set out in
                        Art 34(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    I do not think that the second
                    interpretation of the eventual framework adopted by the working Group is
                    correct. Even after the adoption of the second alternative to Art 13(3),
                    concerns were voiced as to the fact that the continuation of arbitral
                    proceedings, despite a pending challenge of an arbitrator before the court,
                    “could cause unnecessary waste of time and costs if the court later
                    sustained the challenge” (<em>Report of the United Nations
                        Commission on International Trade Law on the Work of its Eighteenth
                        Session</em> (A/40/17, 21 August 1985) (“<em>Eighteenth Session UN Report</em>”) at para 123). This showed
                    that parties were contemplating challenges that took a long time to resolve such
                    that they might even possibly be resolved only after the rendering of an award.
                    The choice is therefore between the first and the third
                interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    With Art 13(3) being silent on the issue of
                    setting aside an award following a successful removal of the challenged
                    arbitrator, and having regard to the terms of Art 5, it would appear that the
                    supervising court has no consequential powers to annul the award and that a
                    separate application to set aside the award based on Art 34 grounds must be
                    filed. Article 5 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In matters governed by this [Model Law], no court shall intervene except
                        where so provided in this [Model Law].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The purpose of Art 5 in achieving certainty
                    as to the extent of maximum judicial intervention was stated in the <em>Eighteenth Session UN Report</em> at para 63:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t was pointed out that resort to intervention by a court
                        during the arbitral proceedings was often used only as a delaying tactic and
                        was more often a source of abuse of the arbitral proceedings than it was a
                        protection against abuse. The purpose of article 5 was to achieve certainty
                        as to the maximum extent of judicial intervention, including assistance, in
                        international commercial arbitrations, by compelling the drafters to list in
                        the (model) law on international commercial arbitration all instances of
                        court intervention. Thus, if a need was felt for adding another such
                        situation, it should be expressed in the model law. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Similar remarks were made in the <em>Analytical Commentary</em> at p 18:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Art 5] merely requires that any instance of court intervention
                        be listed in the model law. <em>Its effect would, thus, be to
                            exclude any general or residual powers given to the courts in a domestic
                            system which are not listed in the model law.</em> The resulting
                        certainty of the parties and the arbitrators about the instances in which
                        court supervision or assistance is to be expected seems beneficial to
                        international commercial arbitration. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    As stated, the purpose of Art 5 was
                    explained and given judicial effect by our Court of Appeal in <em>PT First Media</em> (see [112] above) and in <em>L W
                        Infrastructure (CA)</em> at [35]–[38].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In <em>L W Infrastructure

                    Appeal at [36], [38] and [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    The effect of Art 5 of the Model Law is to confine
                            the power of the court to intervene in an arbitration to those instances
                            which are provided for in the Model Law and to “exclude any
                            general or residual powers” arising from sources other than the
                            Model Law (see H M Holtzmann &amp; J E Neuhaus, <em>A
                                Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial
                                Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary</em> (Kluwer
                            Law and Taxation Publishers, 1989) (“<em>Holtzmann
                                &amp; Neuhaus</em>”) at p 216). The <em>raison d’être</em> of Art 5 of the Model Law is not to
                            promote hostility towards judicial intervention but to “satisfy
                            the need for certainty as to when court action is permissible”
                                (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    In our view, having regard to the need for a
                            broadly consistent approach to the interpretation of the Act and the
                            Model Law, s 47 of the Act should be construed in a manner that is
                            consistent with the intent underlying Art 5 of the Model Law. Section 47
                            of the Act states that the court shall not have jurisdiction to
                            interfere with an arbitral award except where so provided in the Act.
                            The certainty which is sought to be achieved by this provision would be
                            significantly undermined if the courts retained a concurrent
                            “supervisory jurisdiction” over arbitral proceedings or
                            awards that could be exercised by the grant of declaratory orders not
                            expressly provided for in the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    In short, in situations expressly regulated by the
                            Act, the courts should only intervene where so provided in the Act (see

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    As a result of Art 5, it must be accepted
                    that the first interpretation that an award is automatically rendered a nullity
                    by an upholding of a challenge under Art 13(3) cannot be adopted. Furthermore,
                    as between the first and third interpretation, the third interpretation finds
                    support in the relevant sections of the <em>travaux
                        préparatoires</em> case authorities and academic commentaries.
                    Therefore, there appears to be no legal basis for PTCI’s assertion of a
                    residual discretion to set aside an award outside of Art 34. I now turn to
                    consider the viability of the third interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arbitrator’s apparent bias or partiality as a ground for
                setting aside an award is subsumed under existing grounds under Art 34(2)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The third possibility finds support in the
                    relevant sections of the <em>travaux préparatoires</em>,
                    case authorities and academic commentaries. Therefore, there appears to be no
                    legal basis for PTCI’s assertion of a residual discretion to set aside an
                    award outside of Art 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    At the conclusion of the fifth draft, and
                    the Working Group decided by then to exclude “removal of
                    arbitrator” (<em>ie</em>, the proposed ground) under
                    Art 34 in favour of adopting “a compromise solution” in Art 13(3)
                    (see <em>Report of the Working Group on International Contract
                        Practices on the Work of its Seventh Session</em> (A/CN.9/246, 6 March
                    1984), the possibility that a party may still challenge the arbitrator’s
                    impartiality or independence under Art 34(2) was brought to the drafters’
                    attention by Norway as stated in the <em>Analytical Compilation
                        of Comments</em> at p 24 as follows (“Norway’s
                    Comment”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Norway is of the view that if a party does not raise an objection in the
                        period of time provided for in paragraph (2), he should be precluded from
                        raising it not only during the arbitral proceedings but also under articles
                        34(2)(a)(iv) and 36(1)(a)(iv) and that this should be clearly expressed
                        either in article 13 or in articles 34 and 36.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Norway’s Comment was not taken up by
                    the drafters; the drafters’ decision not to include the proposed ground
                    was not a mere oversight. Despite exclusion of the proposed ground, recourse to
                    set aside an award based on the lack of impartiality or independence remains
                    available under Art 34(2). As Gary Born put it in <em>International Commercial Arbitration vol 3</em> (Kluwer Law
                    International, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<em>International
                        Commercial Arbitration vol 3</em>”) at pp 3277-3278):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even in the absence of express statutory authority, national courts and
                        commentators have frequently concluded that claims of an arbitrator’s
                        lack of independence or impartiality are <em>impliedly
                            included within the general provisions of Article 34(2)</em> or
                        equivalent annulment provisions of other national laws [citing a number of
                        European cases]. The impartiality of the arbitral tribunal is central to the
                        arbitral process, and awards by partial or biased arbitrators can be
                        annulled in most jurisdictions. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Mr Born also opines in <em>International Commercial Arbitration: Law and Practice</em> (Kluwer
                    Law International, 2012) at p 130 that the Model Law framework preserves a
                    party’s right to challenge an arbitrator’s impartiality or
                    independence <em>after the delivery of the arbitral
                        award</em> by way of an application under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) or Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Most arbitration statutes impose requirements of impartiality on
                        arbitrators. The Model Law is representative, with Article 12(2) providing
                        that: “An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist
                        that give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence
                        …” Article 12(2) imposes a substantive standard of
                        impartiality and independence, which all members of the tribunal must
                        satisfy and which provides a basis for challenging an arbitrator or proposed
                        arbitrator. In addition, Articles 34(2)(a)(iv) and 36(1)(a)(iv) of the Model
                        Law provide for annulment or non-recognition of awards, based upon an
                        arbitrator’s lack of independence or impartiality under the law of the
                        arbitral seat, while Articles 34(2)(b)(ii) and 36(1)(b)(ii) provide for
                        annulment or non-recognition of the award, based on a violation of the
                        forum’s public policy (which often include minimum standards of
                        impartiality and independence).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    With specific regard to Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv), this ground for setting aside is regarded as a
                    catch-all provision for procedural defects under the arbitration agreement or
                    under the Model Law (see <em>Peter Binder</em> at para
                    7–021). Article 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) states as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the court specified in Article 6
                        only if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iv) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure
                        was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless such
                        agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Law from which the
                        parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance
                        with this Law …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    I am of the opinion that a challenge to an
                    arbitrator’s impartiality or independence is a ground for setting aside
                    under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv). In fact Norway’s
                    Comment is a strong pointer that it was taken to be the case that justifiable
                    doubt as to an arbitrator’s impartiality or independence is not only a
                    ground to challenge an arbitrator under Art 13(3) read with Art 12(2) but also a
                    ground for setting aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) as
                    well. As stated at [52] above, this is likely to be because of the fact that the
                    requirement of impartiality or independence amounts to a mandatory provision
                    implied under Art 12(2) the breach of which is “not in accordance with
                    this Law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Furthermore, in addition to Art
                        34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) where public policy is being
                    invoked to set aside an award, lack of impartiality or independence on the part
                    of an arbitrator is a recognised ground for setting aside an award under Art
                        34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) (see <em>Beijing
                        Sinozonto Mining Investment Co Ltd v Goldenray Consortium (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2014] 1 SLR 814 at [41] where I had observed that lack of
                    impartiality and independence of the tribunal that would certainly shock the
                    conscience and be clearly injurious to the public good or wholly offensive to
                    the ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The setting aside of an award </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I now turn to situation at hand: where the
                    arbitrator was removed under Art 13(3) on Art 12(2) grounds of justifiable doubt
                    as to impartiality or independence and an order is sought to set aside the
                    arbitrator’s award by reason of his removal. The question that arose
                    before me was whether the setting aside would be subject to the more stringent
                    requirements of Art 34(2). The answer in principle is probably in the
                    affirmative but from an evidential point of view, the task of satisfying the
                    requirements of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) or Art
                        34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) may not be so difficult in
                    application. The proof that the applicant has to furnish is the court order to
                    remove the arbitrator. The setting aside application can be said to depend on
                    the removal order, and the opposing party will not be allowed to go behind the
                    decision which is non-appealable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I start with the dichotomy between an
                    application to remove an arbitrator and an application to set aside an award. Mr
                    Born observed in <em>International Commercial Arbitration vol
                        2</em> (at pp 1823–1824):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Importantly … it is clear that the standards applicable
                        for removal of an arbitrator for lack of independence or impartiality are
                        materially different from the standards applicable to annulment or
                        non-recognition of an award because of arbitrator bias or partiality.
                            <em>That is apparent from the text of both national
                            arbitration legislation and the New York Convention: neither the
                            annulment nor non-recognition provisions of these instruments contain
                            the standards of impartiality or independence set forth in Article 12 of
                            the UNCITRAL Model Law and equivalent provisions of national arbitration
                            legislation.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The same result is compelled by the structure and purposes of both the
                        Convention and national arbitration legislation. The removal of an
                        arbitrator from the tribunal, during the course of the arbitral proceedings,
                        as one element of an arbitral institution’s or national court’s
                        supervisory authority, is a fundamentally different action than the
                        annulment or non-recognition of an award, after the arbitration has
                        concluded. <em>The latter action involves much more
                            significant costs, in terms of delays and costs (to rerun the entire
                            arbitration) and possibilities for national court interference with the
                            objectives of the parties’ agreement to
                        arbitrate.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a consequence, as discussed below, courts have applied significantly
                        different standards to issues of arbitrator impartiality and independence in
                        the context of annulment and non-recognition proceedings than in proceedings
                        to remove an arbitrator. <em>That includes both less
                            demanding standards of arbitrator impartiality and independence, than
                            those applicable under Article 12(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law and
                            similar legislation, and requirements for showings that the
                            arbitrator’s bias had a material effect on the arbitral proceeding
                            and its outcome.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Mr Born then states in <em>International Commercial Arbitration vol 3</em> at p 3279:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]here are important differences in the standards that are
                        applicable, respectively, to interlocutory removal of an arbitrator and
                        annulment of an award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular, an arbitrator can be removed based on “justifiable
                        doubts” regarding his or her independence or impartiality – a
                        standard that does not require establishing that it is more likely than not
                        that the arbitrator is biased or partial or that the arbitral
                        tribunal’s decisions are or would be materially affected by that bias.
                            <em>In contrast, annulment of an award cannot be based
                            upon “doubts” about (or “risks” of)
                            arbitrator bias</em>, but instead requires a showing, by a
                        preponderance of the evidence, that an arbitrator was in fact biased or
                        lacked the requisite independence. Moreover, in contrast to interlocutory
                        challenges to arbitrators, annulment of an award requires a showing of
                        materiality and prejudicial effects of the arbitrator’s bias on the
                        arbitral process – which can provide a substantial obstacle to
                        annulment of an award, based on one arbitrator’s asserted lack of
                        impartiality, made after a lengthy and otherwise satisfactory arbitral
                        process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I have several comments in relation to the
                    passages quoted above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Firstly, Mr Born’s commentaries
                    envisage either a challenge against the arbitrator or against the award, not
                    both. His commentaries highlight the differences between an Art 13(3) challenge
                    and an Art 34(2) application to set aside an award. Specifically, an Art 13
                    challenge is directed at the tribunal before an award is rendered and as Robert
                    Merkin and Johanna Hjalmarsson, <em>Singapore Arbitration
                        Legislation Annotated</em> (Informa 2009 Ed) (“<em>Merkin</em>”) remarked (at p 89):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only means of challenging arbitral proceedings during their currency
                        and before an award has been issued is by way of an application to remove
                        the arbitrator. It is not possible to challenge an arbitrator under Model
                        Law, s 34 or under s24, prior to the making of an award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The distinction in the two tests is
                    maintained especially where only one challenge is mounted and not
                both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Even if Mr Born’s commentaries cover
                    both applications in a situation like the present case, the differences
                    highlighted in the passages above may not be so significant because the
                    statement of principle, <em>ie</em>, a justificable doubt
                    as to biasness, in the context of our legal jurisprudence, is equivalent to the
                    statement of principle, “reasonable suspicion” as to biasness,
                    which is the test to determine apparent bias (see [16] above). A justifiable
                    doubt as to biasness can legitimately be framed as a reasonable suspicion as to
                    bias. From this perspective, the reasonable suspicion test is applied to
                    determine apparent bias in an application made under Art 13(3) and Art
                    34(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    My second comment relates to the matter of
                    proof. Art 34(2) requires the applicant to furnish proof of the grounds relied
                    upon to set aside an award. Where there is a court decision to remove the
                    arbitrator, and the applicant wishes to rely on Art 32(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) to set aside the award, the applicant need only furnish
                    proof of the court order. Viewed in this light, the ground to set aside would be
                    the removal order (which is non-appealable) that confirms that the arbitrator
                    is, at the very least, marred with apparent bias. The application to set aside
                    under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) could then be said to
                    depend on the removal order that <em>ipso facto</em>
                    signifies either a violation of a mandatory provision under Model Law (in this
                    case, Art 12(2) for want of impartiality) or, in other words, actual, imputed or
                    apparent bias or breach of an important procedural rule, in this case Rule 9 of
                    the 2007 Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    It is accepted that not every violation of
                    arbitral procedures will lead to an order to set aside: the violation must have
                    been substantive if on the same grounds the court ordered the arbitrator’s
                    removal. In this connection, the court’s discretionary power to set aside
                    is likely to be exercised in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary.
                    However, if the order to remove the arbitrator was obtained by illegal means,
                    the applicant would have failed to submit proof in the sense that the document
                    purporting to evidence the ground in Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) was invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Thirdly, Mr Born’s concern with the
                    requirement of prejudice may not be a problem in application. For instance,
                    within the framework of Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv), a party
                    applying to set aside for procedural irregularity need not establish that the
                    procedural irregularity had materially affected the award. As stated, a court
                    order to remove the arbitrator is a serious matter. It signifies that the breach
                    of procedure was not technical or immaterial. From this perspective, an
                    inference of bias can be drawn from the court order and hence the existence of
                    prejudice in relation to any award made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As it was put in <em>Re
                        Shanker</em> at [103]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once a court has found that matters have been established which could give
                        rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias, it would not be appropriate then to
                        examine if it is to be isolated and treated as immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Similarly, the Supreme Court of Canada in
                        <em>R v S (RD)</em> [1997] 3 SCR 484, a decision which
                    Mr Chacko referred to, held (at 526) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f a reasonable apprehension of bias arises, it colours the entire
                        proceedings and it cannot be cured by the correctness of the subsequent
                        decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The same comments on application can be made
                    if a party using the same grounds challenges an arbitrator’s impartiality
                    or independence after the delivery of the arbitral award under Art
                        34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii). Whilst prejudice is expressly
                    stipulated in s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, the inquiry in
                    relation to prejudice is whether the breach of natural justice was
                    “technical and inconsequential” (see <em>LW
                        Infrastructure (CA)</em> at [54]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Finally, I come to PTCI’s argument
                    that “[a]n arbitrator who has shown apparent bias could avoid the
                    consequences … by issuing an award before any challenge under Art 13(3)
                    of the Model law is disposed of to avoid having himself removed”. A
                    challenged arbitrator is given the option to continue with the arbitral
                    proceedings and render an award. I had to assume that Mr Chacko was making a
                    different point. If he had in mind an arbitrator who had manifested apparent
                    bias and then disingenuously proceeded to rush out an award for illicit reasons,
                    that arbitrator would <em>prima facie</em> have allowed his
                    biasness to infect the award rendered. Accordingly, it was not difficult to
                    foresee that in principle the higher standard stated by Mr Born for setting
                    aside the award would be satisfied as well. However, I refrain from commenting
                    any further on this issue as the present facts did not concern the scenario
                    postulated by PTCI. Suffice to say that it took about five months for the Award
                    to be issued from the time the challenge was filed with the SIAC in May
                    2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OVERALL RESULT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    PTCI’s application in OS 510/2013 was
                    dismissed for the reasons set out in Part 1. I made no order as to SUM 317/2014.
                    I ordered one set of costs to be taxed if not agreed in respect of OS 510/2013
                    and SUM 317/2014 to be paid by PTCI to the first two defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    For the reasons set out in Part 2, OS
                    48/2014 was dismissed with costs fixed at $20,000 plus reasonable
                    disbursements.</p>
