<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff-wife is 46 years old (“the
                    wife”) while the defendant-husband is 47 years old (“the
                    husband”). They were married on 17 December 1994 and their marriage
                    lasted 17 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> They have two sons from this

                    “the sons”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Before the divorce, the husband was the main
                    financial provider of the family. He was a Chief Financial Officer
                    (“CFO”) at a logistics company earning a net salary of $18,689
                        monthly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> His contract was terminated on 23 November
                    2012 because of anxiety, depression and comorbid panic attacks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The
                    husband alleged that as a result of his medical condition, he was not able to
                    secure a permanent job.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Currently, he is staying
                    in the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The wife is the primary caregiver of the family.
                    She is also a part-time accountant and does free-lance work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She left the matrimonial home together with
                    their sons because of the husband’s violence and harassment. They are now
                    staying in a one-room rental flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The divorce proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 13 March 2012, the wife filed for divorce on
                    the ground of the husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The husband contested
                    the divorce. On 13 September 2012 the Family Court granted the wife an interim
                    judgement (“the Interim Judgment”). This application is for the
                    resolution of the following ancillary issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     custody, care and control as well as
                        access of the sons;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     division of the matrimonial assets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     maintenance for the sons and the
                    wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I now proceed to address each issue in
                        turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Custody, care and control of the sons </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Difference between custody order and care and control </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Court of Appeal (“CA”) in
                        <em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> [2005] 3
                    SLR(R) 690 (“<em>CX</em>”) held that the
                    objective of custody orders is different from care and control orders and stated
                    at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As was appropriately summarised by Anthony Dickey in
                            <em>Family Law</em> (LBC Information Services, 3rd
                        Ed, 1997) at pp 326–327:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A]t common law, care and control concerns the right to take care of a
                            child and to make day-to-day, short-term decisions concerning the
                            child’s upbringing and welfare. Custody without care and control
                            (that is, custody in its narrow sense) concerns the right to make the
                            more important, longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and
                            welfare of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It has been suggested that decisions such as those pertaining
                        to religion, education and major healthcare issues feature under the
                        “important and longer-term decisions” concerning the
                        child’s upbringing will be relevant issues relating to custody of the
                        child: Debbie Ong, “Custody Orders, Parental Responsibility and
                        Academic Contributions” [2005] SJLS 405 at p 409. I shall first deal
                        with the issue pertaining to care and control of the
                sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Who should be granted care and control of the sons?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The husband and wife both seek care and control
                    of the sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s case for care and control of the sons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The wife submitted that the husband does not
                    have the interests of the sons at heart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> As proof of the
                    husband’s lack of concern for the sons’ best interests, she tendered
                    evidence to show that the husband had stressed and traumatised her and their two
                    sons by hitting them. The wife stated that she had obtained a Personal
                    Protection Order (“PPO”) against the husband for herself and her
                    elder son on 21 December 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Despite
                    the PPO against the husband, he continued to be violent towards the wife and the
                    sons. Four police reports were thus filed. On 13 August 2012, the husband was
                    arrested for breach of the PPO although no charges were pressed against
                        him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The sons also provided evidence of the
                    husband’s violence towards them. The older son stated in his affidavit
                    that his parents had an altercation on 25 September 2011 when his father tried
                    to hit the mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He stood up against
                    the father to prevent him from hitting his mother and he was also
                        assaulted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This was similarly
                    the case for the younger son, who also tried to protect his mother against the
                    father but was pushed away roughly by the latter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Besides the use of violence, the wife also
                    submitted that the husband is also a bad influence on the sons as he indulged in
                    watching pornographic materials, smoked heavily and did not show keen interest
                    in their schoolwork. He had also failed to contact the sons since they left the
                    matrimonial home on 1 November 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s case for care and control of the sons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The husband, on the other hand, submitted that
                    the sons will be better off with him. He claimed to be involved with their
                    education, to have attended parent-teacher meetings and to have helped them with
                    their homework.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He also stated that he played a greater
                    role in their upbringing and in their education. He also encouraged them to
                    participate in outdoor activities and family outings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> In
                    contrast, he alleged that the wife was the poorer parent because she was an
                    absent mother, allowed the sons to be obsessed with computer games, used vulgar
                    language in front of the children and failed to provide a clean and conducive
                        environment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Interviews of the sons by the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Since the positions of the parties were
                    diametrically opposed and the sons are sufficiently matured, I interviewed the
                    sons separately in the presence of both parties’ counsel so as to arrive
                    at the decision that would be in their best interests. I gave significant weight
                    to their testimony and evidence, seeing that they are of a sufficiently matured
                    age. During the interview, the sons were unequivocal in their disdain for the
                    father and clearly stated that they wanted to live with the mother as she was
                    the parent who cared about them and took care of their physical, mental and
                    educational needs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> This was also the position maintained by them
                    in their respective affidavits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reasons why the court grants care and control of the sons to the wife </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In light of the interviews and affidavits
                    provided by the sons, I find it hard to believe that the husband was a caring
                    and loving father that he painted himself to be. Further, I also find that the
                    husband’s assertions do not sit well with the other pieces of evidence
                    tendered before this court, such as his acts of masturbation, heavy smoking,
                    pornography watching and disruptive behaviour generally. If he was indeed
                    concerned about the sons’ well-being, he would have known that his bad
                    habits could not have been in their best interests. It is unsurprising that the
                    sons prefer to live with their mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The elder son’s examination results also
                    weigh against the husband’s allegations that the wife could not take care
                    of the sons’ educational needs. His good results showed that the wife was
                    capable of ensuring that the sons’ educational needs were met and that
                    they benefitted from her care. Despite the adverse family circumstances, the
                    elder son performed well enough in the O levels to secure a place in a
                    respectable junior college and is now pursuing his studies in the science
                        stream.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> How could he have achieved such results
                    if the wife was indeed the villain that the husband sought to
                portray?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Accordingly, I order that the wife shall have
                    care and control of the sons with reasonable access to be given to the husband.
                    As the sons are sufficiently mature, I shall leave it to the father and sons to
                    work out the arrangements on access.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should sole or joint custody of the sons be awarded?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As for custody of the sons, the husband
                    initially asked for sole custody but subsequently changed his application to
                    joint custody. The wife maintained her application for sole custody throughout
                    the divorce proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s case for sole custody of the sons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The wife submitted that while it would be
                    ideal that joint custody should be awarded so as to maintain parental bonds, but
                    it would not be practicable in the present case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> This was because,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The husband was abusive. First, the
                        PPO obtained on 21 December 2011 still subsists<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and second, his bullying, harassment and
                        violence escalated after the Interim Judgment was awarded, leading to her
                        and the sons moving out of their matrimonial home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The husband was violent towards their younger son and
                        assaulted him in the wife’s absence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     The husband’s character was vindictive and he would
                        annoy her and the sons with, <em>inter alia</em>, his
                        acts of heavy smoking, masturbation and watching pornography. To make
                        matters worse, he did not even clean up after himself, with the tissue he
                        used to masturbate strewn around and semen stains left on the sofa where he
                            masturbated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     The husband disregarded the children’s
                        educational needs by turning up the volume of the television even though
                        they were in the midst of their examinations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s case for sole custody of the sons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The husband on the other hand denied his acts
                    of violence and repulsive behaviour. He claimed that he was never charged and
                    was released the following day, thus showing that the wife’s actions in
                    contacting the police were vindictive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He also
                    cited the wife’s failure to apply for a Domestic Exclusion Order as a
                    factor against the wife’s accusations and there was no evidence as to the
                        same.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The importance of the parental bond</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The court has always been in favour of joint
                    custody so that parental bonds are maintained: Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013)
                    at p 331. In <em>CX</em>, the CA at [38] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would emphasise that recent decisions have been inclined towards making
                        joint or no custody orders due to the need to ensure that the child becomes
                        attached to both parents. The idea behind joint or no custody orders is to
                        ensure that neither parent has a better right over the child and that both
                        have a responsibility to bring the child up in the best way possible.
                        Similarly, the child has a right to the guidance of both his parents.
                        Parenthood is a lifelong responsibility and does not end at a particular age
                        of the child, but continues until the child reached adulthood. The question
                        we have to answer will always be what is best for the child in the
                        future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The above approach gives effect to
                    Singapore’s international obligations, <em>viz</em>,
                    the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (20 November
                    1989), 1577 UNTS 3/ [1991] ATS 4 / 28 ILM 1456 (1989), Art 18 (entered into
                    force 2 September 1990). It is to ensure that best efforts are used to support
                    both parents in the execution of their common responsibilities for the
                    upbringing and development of the child. This approach is also echoed by case
                    law and academic opinion. Thus in making custody orders, the objective of
                    striving to maintain the parental bond should always be one which the court
                    should strive to meet as far as practicably possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Circumstances for granting a sole custody order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are, however, exceptions to this general
                    approach. Two such exceptions were mentioned in <em>CX</em>
                    at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that <em>the
                            exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be
                            where one parents physically, sexually, or emotionally abuses the child
                            (see Debbie Ong, “Making No Custody Order” ([19] supra) at
                            p 586), or where the relationship of the parties is such that
                            co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and
                            counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is harmful
                            to the child</em> (see Debbie Ong, “Parents and Custody
                        Orders” ([27] supra) at p 222-223). [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Therefore, the first exception is where the party seeking
                        custody had ill-treated or exhibited violence against the children, the
                        court will give an order for sole custody in the interests of and for the
                        children’s welfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The second exception relates to a complete
                    lack of cooperation between the antagonistic parents, thus making it impossible
                    for the parents to make proper major decisions for the best interest of their
                    child. This is exemplified in two earlier decisions. In <em>Albert Yeap alias Yeap Beng Yong v Wong Elizabeth (m w)</em> [1998]
                    SGHC 97, a sole custody order was order to minimise conflicts between the
                    parents. Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) held that (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16 Given such animosity, I am of the view that the best order to make is
                        one which would <em>minimise any source of
                            conflict</em>. If joint custody were given, I anticipate that the
                        parties would have endless disagreements on matters such as choice of
                        schools, tutors, healthcare, etc. Such quarrels would only serve to drive
                        the parties further apart. But more than that, the youngest child, Earl,
                        would grow up in the midst of this animosity, torn between father and mother
                        and may blame himself for these conflicts. Sometimes it is better for a
                        decision to be made, even if it turns out that the perfect option is not
                        chosen, rather than for the matter to be the subject of conflict between the
                        parents. It is clear in my mind that what is called for in this case is for
                        custody of the minor children be granted to their mother who knows the
                        children the best and, in the circumstances, will be in a better position
                        than the husband to take such decisions. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The same purpose of minimising conflict was
                    also seen in <em>Tan Yong Chew v Tan Bee
                        Lay (m w)</em> [1997] SGHC 161 at [8] where Rajendran J held that
                    joint custody was not preferred because it might result in the two parties
                    pulling in different directions where it came to decisions such as “which
                    school the child is to attend” which could be detrimental to the
                    child’s interests. Therefore in such situations, the reluctance to grant
                    joint custody orders stems from the court’s fear that the parties would
                    not be able to cooperate, thereby compromising the child’s
                    interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does the factual matrix of this case justify a sole custody order? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In my view, there is a difference between
                    granting a sole custody order on the basis of acrimony and one in which parties
                    are unable to cooperate with each other. In the former, as was the case in
                        <em>CX</em>, the basis for the grant of a sole custody
                    order was the lack of communication arising from the bitter feelings both
                    parties had towards each other. This has been frowned on by the CA. In the
                    latter, the parties must have shown that they had tried to work together in the
                    child’s best interests but failed. This would be a legitimate ground for a
                    sole custody order to be made. The two scenarios are thus distinct and
                    different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this case the husband had shown himself to
                    be a poor parent from the following acts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     He smoked heavily in the presence of
                        the wife and the sons. On several occasions he even antagonised them with
                        cigarette smoke despite their best efforts to avoid it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     He was erratic when it came to basic things like
                        providing for his family. The wife alleged that the husband did not know how
                        much was required for the maintenance of the children as he is indifferent
                        towards the children’s needs. The husband’s contribution of
                        $1,200 a month towards the household was far from adequate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> On the other hand the husband
                        indulged in his lavish lifestyle, involving an expenditure of more than
                        $17,000 a month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     He verbally abused the wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     He failed to provide for the children’s schooling
                        needs and when the wife managed to obtain financial aid for the younger
                        son’s schooling needs from the government after they moved out from
                        the matrimonial home, he made baseless accusations against her such that the
                        financial aid was revoked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The husband also did not set a good example
                    for the sons. He withdrew his $1,200 monthly maintenance whenever he was
                    displeased with the wife or his children. The wife had to give him sex to
                    appease him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. His addiction to pornography and
                    masturbation, at times visible to the elder son,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> was also a bad influence to his
                sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In contrast, the wife showed much greater
                    concern and interest in the sons. She moved out with the sons to stay in a
                    one-room rental flat so that they could focus on their studies and avoid the
                    annoyances of their father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The wife submitted that in <em>ARI v ARJ</em> [2011] SGDC 135, the district judge had granted a sole
                    custody order in favour of the wife. However, that case is materially different.
                    In that case, the child concerned was very young. Before the eventual sole
                    custody order was made, the district judge had ordered joint custody of the
                    child. The parties had also shown that they were unable to work together for the
                    welfare of the child despite the involvement of social workers. It was only when
                    all else failed that the district judge ordered a sole custody
                order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In this case the children are older and more
                    matured. The wife must show that the husband is so unfit for parenting that the
                    benefits of having his involvement in the sons’ lives outweigh the harm
                    that he would bring to the sons. Alternatively, the wife must show that their
                    relationship is such that cooperation is impossible even after mediation and
                    counselling have been attempted and this lack of cooperation is harmful to the
                    sons: Assoc Prof Debbie Ong, “Parents and Custody Orders–A New
                    Approach” [1999] SJLS 205 at pp 222–223.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In considering the custody of the sons I am
                    also mindful of s 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“WC”) which requires the court to place the welfare of the sons
                    as paramount consideration. Section 125 of the WC states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>125</b>. —(1) The court may at any time by
                        order place a child in the custody of his or her father or his or her mother
                        or (where there are exceptional circumstances making it undesirable that the
                        child be entrusted to either parent) of any other relative of the child or
                        of any organisation or association the objects of which include child
                        welfare, or of any other suitable person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount
                        consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the
                        court shall have regard —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) to the wishes of the parents of the
                        child; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) to the wishes of the child, where he or
                        she is of an age to express an independent opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>During my interviews with the sons, they unequivocally
                        preferred the mother over the father. I have given considerable weightage to
                        their preference in my deliberation on the issue of the custody of the
                        sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     While the behaviour of the husband was
                    deplorable, I agree with the CA in <em>CX</em> on the
                    importance of preserving the parental bond with the child. I also find that
                    there is no evidence that the parties are unable to work together for the
                    sons’ benefit. Therefore I am inclined to grant a conditional joint
                    custody order in order to preserve the parental bond that exists between each of
                    them and the sons. In the event the husband and the wife are unable to arrive at
                    a consensus on issues pertaining to custody order, the wife should have the
                    final say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parental responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is never a pleasant experience for parties
                    undergoing a divorce and for children who are caught in between divorcing
                    parents. Despite the difficulties, parties have to strive to put their
                    differences aside so that the greater good can be achieved for their children.
                    Assoc Prof Debbie Ong’s article Custody Orders, Parental Responsibility
                    and Academic Contributions at p 415 gives some helpful insight:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a perfect world, there should be no marital disputes. If there are, the
                        disputes should be resolved before they escalate till divorce is inevitable.
                        But if divorce is inevitable, the parties should be able to overlook their
                        differences with each other for the sake of their children and raise them
                        together. But if the parties are unable to cooperate with each other in
                        raising their children, they should be helped to do so. Family law
                        endeavours to help parties to co-operate with each other by reiterating the
                        principle that it is in the child’s best interests that neither parent
                        is excluded from the child’s life even where there is a breakdown in
                        the parents’ marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With a conditional joint custody order I hope
                    that the husband will take some time to reflect on his actions and be a better
                    father for the sake of his sons. It is essential that the husband be re-united
                    and re-establishes his relationship with his sons and get more involved in their
                    lives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: The division of the matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The just and equitable principle and the broad brush
                approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The division of matrimonial assets is premised
                    on the just and equitable principle. This principle is embodied in s 112(1) of
                    the WC which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                        judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
                        the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
                        such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
                        of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
                        equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Under s 112(2) of the WC, the court is
                    required to consider the following factors in the division of matrimonial
                    assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property
                        or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party
                        for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the
                        marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of
                        the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any
                        aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and
                        division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one
                        party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is trite law that the court should adopt a
                    broad-brush approach in considering the division of matrimonial assets. In
                        <em>NI v NJ</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75, V K Rajah J held
                    at [18] that this approach calls for the application of sound discretion rather
                    than a purely rigid or mathematical formula and generally speaking when a
                    marriage ends a wife is entitled to an equitable share of the assets she has
                    helped to acquire directly or indirectly. This approach was reaffirmed by the CA
                    in <em>BCB v BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324 at [10]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The broad-brush approach is particularly apposite because, in the nature
                        of things, an approach that is rooted in the forensic search for the actual
                        financial contributions of the parties towards the acquisition of the assets
                        will inevitably fail to adequately value the indirect contributions made
                        towards the other expenses that are incurred in the course of raising a
                        family and will also be a heavily fact-centric exercise. Moreover, these
                        facts will typically not be borne out by contemporaneous records, as
                        underscored by the court in <em>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon
                            Yock</em> [1998] SGHC 204 at [6] (cited by this court in
                            [<em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743]). <em>The broad-based approach also avoids what this court has
                            described as an otherwise fruitless "mechanistic accounting procedure
                            reflected in the form of an arid and bloodless balance sheet" that
                            "would be contrary to the letter and spirit of the legislative scheme"
                            underlying s 112</em> (see <em>NK v NL</em>
                        at [36], an observation which was most recently referred to by this court in
                            <em>AYQ v AYR</em> [2013] 1 SLR 476 at [18]).
                        Indeed, such a broad yet principled approach enables us to strike a balance
                        between the search for a just and principled outcome in each case and the
                        need to remain sensitive to the nuances of each fact situation we are
                        confronted with. We pause to note - parenthetically - that this is why the
                        Singapore courts have avoided extreme points of departure. For example, this
                        court has held that there is no starting point, presumption or norm of an
                        equal division of matrimonial assets, a holding that is wholly consistent
                        with the legislative background which resulted in s 112 and its concomitant
                        broad-brush approach (see, for example, the decision of this court in
                            <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3
                        SLR(R) 520 at [50]-[58]). Another example - to be considered in a moment -
                        is the fact that the court will take into account both direct as well as
                        indirect contributions by both parties to the marriage. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Financial contributions of the husband and wife for the matrimonial
                home at Compassvale Walk </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The main matrimonial asset owned by the
                    husband and the wife is Block 239 Compassvale Walk Singapore 540239 (“the
                    Compassvale Property”). Before the divorce proceedings commenced, the
                    wife’s direct financial contribution towards the repayment of the loan for
                    this property was higher than the husband and was in the region of 59% to 41% in
                    her favour.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> On 16 September 2012, a few days after the
                    Interim Judgement was issued, the husband paid up the outstanding mortgage in
                    full, the sum being $102,213.35 from his CPF.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> With this, the direct

                    CPF money towards the purchase of this property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> This
                    property was subsequently sold and the parties disputed the distribution of the
                    proceeds of sale from this property sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The wife alleged that the proceeds of $200,000
                    from the sale of this property were deposited into the joint POSB account of the
                    husband and wife. Subsequently, this sum was transferred to the husband’s
                    personal account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the

                    $50,000 to his wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The wife denied having received

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The wife also alleged that the proceeds of the
                    sale of Ferraria Park was used to purchase Treasure Trove and that the husband
                    admitted that Treasure Trove was bought with matrimonial funds. However, the
                    husband alleged that he paid 20% of the purchase price ($21,800) of Treasure
                    Trove with fresh funds. He borrowed $70,000 from his mother and $80,000 from his
                        sister.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> He also claimed to have borrowed money from his

                    There are no affidavits from his mother, sister and relatives which if true he
                    could easily obtain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Purchase of the Audi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The husband sold the Mitsubishi and bought an
                    Audi around October 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> He has not
                    revealed the proceeds from the sale of the Mitsubishi. The outstanding loan for
                    the Audi is $206,553.57 while its value is only $190,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> Hence this is a negative asset and I have not
                    included this into the net total of the matrimonial assets.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With respect to indirect contributions, I note
                    that the parties did not employ a domestic helper to assist in the running of
                    the household. The whole responsibility of caring for the needs of their sons
                    and the husband thus fell on the shoulders of the wife. The husband alleged that
                    he had contributed indirectly to the family especially when he was unemployed
                    and during the better years of their marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> I am of the view

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Review of relevant cases on division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     A review of past precedents would be helpful
                    in the determination of what would be a just and equitable division of the
                    matrimonial assets. In <em>Chan Yuen Boey v Sia Hee
                        Soon</em> [2012] 3 SLR 402, Steven Chong J reviewed the past cases and
                    came to the conclusion that “the proportion awarded to homemaker who have
                    made modest financial contributions for marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with
                    children ranged between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets.” He
                    held at [34] to [35] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34 From my review of the cases, <em>the proportion awarded

                            marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with children ranged between 35% to 50%
                            of the total matrimonial assets</em> (see <em>ZD v
                            ZE</em> [2008] SGHC 225, <em>Tan Cheng Guan v Tan
                            Hwee Lee</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1148, <em>AXC v

                        SLR(R) 520 ("<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>")). Where the wife
                        also worked and supported the family financially, the courts have not
                        hesitated to award her up to 60% of the total assets (see <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 and
                            <em>Tan Bee Bee v Lim Kim Chin</em> [2004] SGHC 242
                            ("<em>Tan Bee Bee</em>")).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35 The exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife was less
                        than 35%, typically concerned cases where the total pool of matrimonial
                        assets had been very substantial, in excess of $100m (see, <em>Ng Ngah Len @ Datin Sandra Kuah v Kuah Tian Nam @ Dato Peter
                            Kuah</em> [2003] SGHC 109 ("<em>Ng Ngah
                            Len</em>") and <em>Yeo Chong Lin (CA)</em>).
                        In those exceptional situations, the apportionment to the wife had been, in
                        absolute terms, substantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The CA in <em>BCB v
                        BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324 also undertook an exhaustive inquiry into
                    cases where the marriages were ten years or longer, the couples had children,
                    both parties were working and where the husband had greater direct financial
                    contributions than the wife. Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA relied on an empirical
                    study by Lim Hui Min entitled “Matrimonial Asset Division: The Art of
                    Achieving a Just and Equitable Result” in <em>SAL
                        Conference 2011: Developments in Singapore Law between 2006 and 2010, Trends
                        and Perspectives</em> (Yeo Tiong Min, Hans Tjio &amp; Tang Hang Wu gen
                    eds) (Academy Publishing, 2011) at pp 191–243. Paragraph 101 of the
                    article was cited by the CA at [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears that when the husband has greater direct financial
                        contributions to the matrimonial assets than the wife, who is an 'ordinary'
                        working mother, the wife will get about 40% of the pool of matrimonial
                        assets, which will be more than her direct financial contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     These precedents provide useful guidance. In
                    this case the wife had substantially financed the purchase of the Compassvale
                    Property. Her direct contribution was about 30% after the husband had paid
                    $102,314.35 from his CPF account towards the matrimonial home at about the time
                    of the Interim Judgement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> As for the purchase
                    of Treasure Trove, I find that the down payment of $218,800 came from the
                    matrimonial funds, especially from the proceeds of the sale of Ferraria
                        Park.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the wife had made substantial
                    financial contributions towards the two matrimonial properties, which are the
                    two main matrimonial assets in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should an adverse inference be drawn against either party?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     During the course of proceedings, an issue of
                    adverse inference arose because both parties alleged that the other had not made
                    full and frank disclosure of the assets, and urged the court to draw an adverse
                    inference against the other.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> The law on drawing adverse inferences is
                    succinctly stated in the CA case of <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai
                        Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We consider that the trial judge was correct in rejecting the Wife’s
                        plea to do so. It is well established that in order for a court to draw an
                        adverse inference, there must, in the first place, be some substratum of
                        evidence that establishes a <em>prima facie</em> case
                        against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn. In addition,
                        it must be shown that the person against whom the inference is to be drawn
                        has some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding
                        (perhaps because it is peculiarly within his knowledge). In other words, the
                        court’s ability to draw an adverse inference does not and cannot
                        displace the legal burden of proof that continues to lie with the plaintiff,
                        or, as in this appeal, the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I have perused the submissions of each party
                    and I accepted the explanation of the wife regarding the purported case of false
                    declaration to the Ministry of Education<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> which was corroborated by the
                    younger son’s affidavit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> I also accepted the
                    wife’s explanation that she has a joint DBS bank account with her mother.
                    However, I am unable to accept the husband’s explanation that he borrowed
                    monies from his mother, sister and relatives to pay for the 20% down payment
                    amounting to $218,800 for the purchase of Treasure Trove.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> There are no affidavits from his mother and
                    sister. Why is this so? In the absence of proof, I am unable to accept his bare
                    assertions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The husband also failed to account with
                    supporting evidence the proceeds of the sale of the Ferraria Park property and
                    the sale of the Mitsubishi car. He also claimed that his monthly expenses
                    amounted to $17,656.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> However, the bank accounts that he
                    disclosed showed amounts, which made it hard to believe he could afford such a
                    lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     For the above reasons, I find that the husband
                    has not made a full and frank disclosure of his assets and I draw an adverse
                    inference against him. Taking into account the direct and indirect contributions
                    of the parties, I am of the view that a just and equitable division of the
                    matrimonial assets would be 45% for the wife and 55% for the husband. I also
                    award an additional 5% to the wife because of the adverse inference drawn
                    against the husband. Therefore, the wife will have 50% share of the matrimonial
                    assets. As the wife will have custody, care and control of the son she will have
                    the first option to the matrimonial home, which is the Compassvale
                    Property.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     From the comparative table above, I noticed
                    that the parties have agreed on a number of items. They disagreed however with
                    the estimate for food. The wife included school trips, outing with friends and
                    travelling allowances as part of the son’s expenses. The husband, however,
                    opined that those items are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The maintenance of the sons is a shared
                    responsibility. In this case, I am mindful that I have given custody, care and
                    control to the wife. It is a heavy responsibility. The husband claims that he is
                    now unemployed. Prior to the divorce, I note that he was capable of earning much
                    more than his wife. I find that with his former experience of being a CFO of a
                    relatively large company, his prospects of reemployment remain bright. Taking
                    all the circumstances into consideration, I order that the husband pays $700 per
                    month for each of the two sons with effect from 1 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The maintenance of the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The husband does not wish to pay for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On the issue of the wife’s maintenance,
                    firstly, I have to decide whether she should be given maintenance. If the answer
                    is yes, then I have to determine the appropriate and just amount for her
                    maintenance. Section 113 of the WC, states that “the court may order a
                    man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife”. Section 114 of the WC
                    stipulates a myriad of non-exhaustive factors that the court should take into
                    account for the assessment of the maintenance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114. —(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by
                        a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the
                        circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) the income, earning capacity, property
                        and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has
                        or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) the financial needs, obligations and
                        responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely
                        to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>c</em>) the standard of living enjoyed by the
                        family before the breakdown of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>d</em>) the age of each party to the marriage
                        and the duration of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>e</em>) any physical or mental disability of
                        either of the parties to the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>f</em>) the contributions made by each of the
                        parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any
                        contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>g</em>) in the case of proceedings for divorce
                        or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage
                        of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution
                        or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of
                        acquiring.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour
                        so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to
                        their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would
                        have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly
                        discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Bearing in mind the above provisions and her
                    expenses, I am of the view that the wife’s claim for maintenance is on the
                    high side. I agree with the husband that pocket money for the wife’s
                    parents at $250 per month should not be included in the wife’s expenses. A
                    fair amount for the maintenance of the wife will be $1,200 per month with effect
                    from 1 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I am also not inclined to award lump sum
                    maintenance for her. The wife is about 46 years old and it is possible that she
                    may re-marry in the future. Thus it would be fairer to award a monthly
                    maintenance instead. If there are changes in the circumstances of either party,
                    they can separately apply for a variation order. For the sake of clarity, I have
                    built into their maintenance orders the monthly household expenses of $548.82 as
                    such a sum cannot be a standalone order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The summary of my orders is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     The wife will have care and control
                        of the sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     The parties shall have joint custody of the sons, on the condition that the
                        wife shall be the final decision-maker with respect to all decisions in
                        which the parties cannot agree upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     The wife will have a 50% share of the total matrimonial
                        assets with the first option to acquire the Compassvale Property. If this
                        option is not exercised within six months of the judgement, the Compassvale
                        Property shall be sold in the open market.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_d"></a>(d)     If the wife decides to buy over the Compassvale
                        Property, the husband shall transfer all his rights, shares and interests in
                        that property to the wife upon payment of the difference, if any. The wife
                        shall bear all the expenses for the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_e"></a>(e)     This order is made subject to the Central
                        Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2013 Rev Ed) (“CPF Act”) and the
                        subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to
                        the terms of this order in accordance with those
                    provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        husband will pay maintenance of $700 per month for each son with effect from
                        1 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_g"></a>(g)     The husband will pay maintenance of $1,200 per month to the wife with
                        effect from 1 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_h"></a>(h)     The Registrar of the Supreme Court is empowered to
                        execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters
                        contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail
                        to do so within seven days of the written request being made to the
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     There will be no order as to
                costs.</p>
