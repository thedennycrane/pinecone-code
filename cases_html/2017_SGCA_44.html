These applications were all based on new legal arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The present criminal motion (“the Present Motion”) differs from these cases in that the sole basis for review relied upon by the applicant, Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi (“the Applicant”), is fresh evidence. The question before us is whether the Applicant’s case is sufficiently exceptional to warrant a review under the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 13 November 2011, the Applicant, a Nigerian national, flew from Lagos, Nigeria to Singapore. Prior to his departure from Lagos, he checked in a black luggage bag (“the Black Luggage”), which he collected upon his arrival in Singapore. That night, the Applicant passed the Black Luggage to one Hamidah Binte Awang (“Hamidah”). Hamidah placed the Black Luggage in her car and drove to Woodlands Checkpoint. At Woodlands Checkpoint, Hamidah’s car was searched. The Black Luggage was cut open at the sides and drugs were discovered therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Applicant was subsequently charged with trafficking in not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). Hamidah was charged with attempting to export not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine, an offence under s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA and punishable under either s 33 or s 33B of the MDA. Both the Applicant and Hamidah claimed trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 21 June 2013, the Applicant was asked by ASP Deng Kaile (“ASP Deng”), the Investigating Officer handling the investigations into his case, if he wished to be sent for a psychiatric evaluation.

</div> The Applicant indicated that he did not want a psychiatric evaluation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The trial took place in late 2014. The main issue before the trial judge (“the Judge”) was whether the Applicant and Hamidah had knowledge of the drugs concealed in the Black Luggage. At the end of the trial, the Judge acquitted the Applicant but convicted Hamidah (see <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another </span>[2015] SGHC 4).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Prosecution appealed against the Applicant’s acquittal by way of Criminal Appeal No 10 of 2014 (“CCA 10/2014”). On 29 June 2015, we allowed the appeal and convicted the Applicant of the charge preferred against him (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>”)). We should point out that one of our reasons for allowing the appeal was that we found that the Judge had failed to properly consider the impact of the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) (<span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [88]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The matter was remitted to the Judge for sentencing. Given the quantity of drugs trafficked, the Applicant could be sentenced to suffer the penalty of death. On 18 September 2015, with a view to considering whether the Applicant had grounds to argue that he should instead be sentenced to life imprisonment under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA on the basis of diminished responsibility, the Applicant’s lawyer, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”), requested Changi Prison’s Complex Medical Centre for a psychiatric report on the Applicant.

This court had in the past considered itself <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio </span>in such situations, as held<span class="font-italic"> </span>in four cases decided in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 2 SLR 192, this court expressed <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>support for a wider jurisdiction to reopen concluded criminal appeals. Following that decision, concluded criminal appeals were reviewed in three cases (namely, <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Kong (Prosecutorial Discretion) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Quek</span><span class="font-italic"> Hock Lye</span>), all of which involved questions of constitutional law that had not been considered at the hearing of the respective appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, after tracing the developments in Singapore in this area of law, this court examined the position in several foreign jurisdictions before restating the test for determining whether it would review a concluded criminal appeal as follows (at [44]) – there had to be “sufficient material on which the court can say that there has been a miscarriage of justice”. The court went on to elaborate on this test in these terms (likewise at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Analytically, we see this test as comprising two essential components:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first is the evidential requirement of “sufficient material”. The court must be satisfied that the material adduced in support of the application for review is both “new” and “compelling” before it will consider the application. If the material presented does not satisfy these two indicia, then the application fails <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine</span> and the inquiry stops there. The burden of production rests on the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The second is the substantive requirement that a “miscarriage of justice” must have been occasioned. This is the threshold which must be crossed before the court will consider that a concluded criminal appeal ought to be reopened. The burden of proving this likewise rests on the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> represents this court’s perception of the right balance between the prevention of error on the one hand and the according of proper respect to the principle of finality of proceedings on the other. We also discussed in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> the policy tension in a case involving the death penalty such as the Present Motion (at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the principle of finality is no less important in cases involving the death penalty. There is no question that as a modality of punishment, capital punishment is different because of its irreversibility. For this reason, capital cases deserve the most anxious and searching scrutiny. This is also reflected in our laws. … But, once the processes of appeal and/or review have run their course, the legal process must recede into the background, and attention must then shift from the legal contest to the search for repose. We do not think it benefits anyone – not accused persons, not their families nor society at large – for there to be an endless inquiry into the same facts and the same law with the same raised hopes and dashed expectations that accompany each such fruitless endeavour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 With these policy considerations in mind, we now proceed to apply the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing </span>to the Present Motion.

He also examined the Applicant’s mental state at the time the Applicant gave his statements to the CNB in the course of the investigations. Dr Sarkar diagnosed the Applicant as suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) which arose as a result of childhood trauma. According to the IMH Report, as a young Christian child living in a Muslim-dominated town, the Applicant had witnessed an attack by a Muslim tribe. The attack was recounted in the IMH Report as follows:

In addition, Dr Sarkar considered various factors, including the manner in which the Applicant brought up his PTSD symptoms (see above at [26]), the Applicant’s aversion to being labelled mentally ill and the Applicant’s record in prison of repeatedly stopping the antidepressant medication which he had been prescribed, before stating that the validity of his diagnosis of PTSD “is not in question”.

The Prosecution’s objection that the IMH Report is unreliable can be easily addressed if this court allows the Present Motion and makes the appropriate orders for the taking of further evidence on matters arising from the IMH Report. It could then turn out that the psychiatrist who prepared the CMC Report and Dr Ung (who prepared the Private Report), or any other psychiatrist who might be consulted, might disagree with Dr Sarkar’s diagnosis if asked to comment on it. Such disagreement among psychiatrists is not uncommon. It will then be for the court to decide whether Dr Sarkar’s diagnosis of PTSD is correct, and if so, to assess what impact PTSD had on the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Prosecution has also cast doubt on the reliability of the IMH Report on the basis that the Applicant, when assessed by Dr Ung, did not mention anything about the alleged childhood trauma which forms the foundation of Dr Sarkar’s diagnosis of PTSD.

Essentially, [the Applicant’s] point is that, because he did not know the full facts of what had happened, he decided to deny anything that was not in his possession as he felt that was the safer course to take. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 After analysing the Applicant’s explanation for his lies, we ruled on the False Statements Issue as follows (<span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> at [61] and [87]–[88]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 The [Applicant]’s excuses for the lies were wholly unsatisfactory and unbelievable. It is clear to us that he had deliberately lied to distance himself from the drugs in the Black Luggage, the existence of which he knew. Quite simply, there is no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt. To suggest that the [Applicant] was justified to lie as a defensive move would be to turn reason and logic on its head.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87 In the present case, the [Applicant]’s version of the facts is quite improbable. There was also no corroborating evidence for various key aspects of the [Applicant]’s case. That said, we would still have hesitated to think that the [Applicant]’s version of the facts is so incredible that it would <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> justify appellate interference. Had the case <span class="font-italic">merely</span> turned on the Judge’s assessment [of] the credibility of the [Applicant]’s oral testimony at trial (and nothing more), we might have declined to interfere.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88 What <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">tipped the scales</span> are the numerous lies and omissions made by the [Applicant] in his statements, for which there is no innocent explanation.

In those cases<span class="font-italic">,</span> the evidence of the respective [accused persons] at trial was consistent with their statements, and this lent credibility to their evidence at trial (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Farid</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28] and <span class="font-italic">Hla</span><span class="font-italic"> Win </span>at [42] and [43]).

Unfortunately, the Judge erred in failing to draw an adverse inference against the [Applicant] for his lies and omissions, and also in failing to properly consider the impact of the lies and omissions in [the Applicant’s] statements on the credibility of the [Applicant]’s evidence at the trial … We could not see how the [Applicant] could be considered to have rebutted the presumption of knowledge on a balance of probabilities when the objective facts are all stacked against him, including all the lies he uttered as well as the material facts he deliberately suppressed in all his statements, and when the sole objective fact which is in his favour (going into the car of Hamidah) is really of limited value. The lies were told by the [Applicant] obviously to distance himself from the Black Luggage and the [d]rugs concealed therein.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The IMH Report is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>powerfully probative in relation to the False Statements Issue because Dr Sarkar has opined that the Applicant’s PTSD was “likely” to have caused him to give false statements to the CNB (see [20] above).

</div>
</div> As we stated in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [83], CCA 10/2014 “turn[ed] primarily on questions of fact, and it is a well-established principle that an appellate court is usually slow to overturn the factual findings of a trial judge”. The IMH Report raises a powerful probability that our decision on the False Statements Issue – and, in turn, on CCA 10/2014 as a whole – is wrong, notwithstanding the other aspects of our reasoning in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> which support our decision in that appeal. Given these circumstances, we think <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">it would be best to </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">reconsider all the facts of this case only after the additional evidence outlined in our orders at [50] below has been adduced and dealt with.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Another objection which the Prosecution has raised in the Present Motion is that the Applicant seeks, as an alternative to a rehearing of CCA 10/2014, an order that additional oral and/or other evidence be taken in relation to the IMH Report. This, the Prosecution argues, indicates that contrary to the standard set in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> – which requires the wrongfulness of the decision under challenge to be shown “based on the material tendered in support of the application for review alone and without the need for further inquiry” (see the extract from [65] of <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> quoted at [44] above) – the IMH Report does not on its own show a powerful probability that this court erred in overturning the Judge’s order of acquittal and convicting the Applicant in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We have already dealt with this point earlier when we explained at [28] and [45] above why we are applying the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> in a slightly modified form here. Due to the unique turn of events in this case, there is nothing objectionable about the Applicant’s prayer for additional evidence to be taken. In fact, this is what we direct below (at [50]) before a review of our decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> takes place. We are also of the view that the best course of action in this case would be to have such evidence received by the Judge as he would have had to hear the psychiatric evidence in any event, if the Present Motion had not been filed, for the purposes of sentencing the Applicant following this court’s reversal of his acquittal by the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, we will review our decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> only after the Judge has taken the further evidence set out at [50] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our orders on the Present Motion at this stage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We therefore allow the Present Motion in part and order a review of this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">CA</span><span class="font-italic"> (Conviction) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">because of the unique turn of events in this case</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, which make it a “truly exceptional” case of the kind envisaged by this court in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Kho </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Jabing</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [65]</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

In any event, even if this ruling were applicable to the Applicant, we have already stated earlier (at [26] above) that there has not been any intentional drip-feeding of evidence on the Applicant’s part.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Closing observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 We conclude with some observations on the principle of finality of proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span>, this court recognised the importance of upholding the principle of finality. Thus, although we acknowledged “[t]he importance of truth in the criminal process” (at [46]), we also cautioned as follows (at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That said, this does not mean that society should stand paralysed with indecision, or that every legal finding must be open to continual challenge because of perpetual anxiety over the possibility of an error. The perfect, as they say, cannot be allowed to be the enemy of the good. <span class="font-italic">Finality is also a function of justice. It would be impossible to have a functioning legal system if all legal decisions were open to constant and unceasing challenge, like so many tentative commas appended to the end of an unending sentence.</span> Indeed, in the criminal context, challenges to legal decisions are very likely (and are also likely to be continuous and even interminable), given the inherently severe nature of criminal sanctions and the concomitant desire on the part of accused persons to avoid them as far as they can. The concern here is not just with the saving of valuable judicial resources (vital though that is), but also with the integrity of the judicial process itself. <span class="font-italic">Nothing can be as corrosive of general confidence in the criminal process as an entrenched culture of self-doubt engendered by abusive and repetitive attempts to re-litigate matters which have already been decided</span>. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In order to “better vindicate the importance of the principle of finality”, this court set a high standard in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> for its power of review to be invoked so as to ensure that reviews of concluded criminal appeals would be allowed “only in truly exceptional cases” (at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Present Motion is, in our view, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">such </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a “truly exceptional” case because of the unique turn of events.</span> It is entirely fortuitous that the IMH Report – issued only at the sentencing stage and emanating from the <span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s </span>request for a psychiatric report – has raised a matter <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">which has </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a crucial bearing on our decision in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">CA (Conviction)</span>. In future, an accused person who seeks a review of a concluded criminal appeal which was decided against him should not expect that a diagnosis that he was suffering from PTSD (or any other psychiatric condition), whether at the time of the offence and/or at the time he gave his statements to the investigating authorities, will automatically entitle him to a review. Much will depend on the actual evidence, as well as the facts and circumstances of each case. As the majority of this court stated in <span class="font-italic">Harven</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 771 at [2], “[a] factor which is considered to be critical in one case may not be so in another”. Thus, if a case identical or similar to the Present Motion should arise in future, whether or not this court will adopt the same stance as that which we have taken here will turn on whether the test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kho </span><span class="font-italic">Jabing</span> has been satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin  Andrew Phang Boon Leong  Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal Judge of Appeal   Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam and Suang Wijaya (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Ng Cheng Thiam and Chin Jincheng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
