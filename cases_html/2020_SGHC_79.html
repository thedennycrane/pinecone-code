</div> Notwithstanding Double Ace’s cessation of business, the directors continued the same rental arrangement. The Unit continued to be rented to Double Ace for $5,000 per month with no rent collected. On 24 June 2019, the plaintiff filed the present application, seeking leave to commence an action on behalf of Trillion premised on the directors’ failure to collect rent from 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues in the application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Under s 216A(3) of the Companies Act, three requirements must be met in order for leave to be granted for a derivative action to commence. The provision reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  No action or arbitration may be brought and no intervention in an action or arbitration may be made under subsection (2) unless the Court is satisfied that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the complainant has given 14 days’ notice to the directors of the company of his intention to apply to the Court under subsection (2) if the directors of the company do not bring, diligently prosecute or defend or discontinue the action or arbitration;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the complainant is acting in good faith; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) it appears to be prima facie in the interests of the company that the action or arbitration be brought, prosecuted, defended or discontinued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In this case, the requisite notice under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) has been furnished. The defendants disputed only the second and third conditions. The applicable legal standards are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As the applicant for leave, the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that she was acting in good faith: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam </span><span class="font-italic">Swee v Low Hian Chor</span> [2013] 2 SLR 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>”) at [23]. There are essentially two main facets to good faith. First, the applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that the company has a good cause of action: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> Holding Pte Ltd and others v Healthstats International Pte Ltd and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 825 (“<span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]. The focus here is on the honest or reasonable belief, not the objective merits of the claim: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [43]. Second, the applicant must not be acting for a collateral purpose, or if there is a collateral purpose, the action must still be consistent with the company’s best interests: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [44]; <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [31]. The inquiry may also go beyond these two facets to incorporate findings arising from the applicant’s conduct during proceedings. A failure to be fully candid, for example, would point to a lack of good faith: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [48], citing <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan</span><span class="font-italic"> v Toh Teck Chye and others </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 471.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">Prima facie</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the interests of the company</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In order to establish that the derivative action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company, the applicant bore the burden of showing that the action was “legitimate and arguable”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [53]. The claim must have a reasonable semblance of merit, not one which is frivolous, vexatious or bound to be unsuccessful: see <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [49]. The expected benefit to the company must be real to justify the costs and effort of pursuing the action when the company itself had not proceeded with it. Therefore, the applicant must not only identify causes of action, she must also show that the company has sustained or may sustain real loss or damage as a result of the alleged failures and that there is some prospect of obtaining relief or redress through the proposed action: <span class="font-italic">Law Chin Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd (Lau Chin Hu and others, applicants) </span>[2009] SGHC 223 at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The threshold is a low one and the court should only exclude the most “obviously unmeritorious claims”: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments </span>at [50], citing <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [55].  At the same time, there is a need to ensure that the threshold is not so low that the derivative action will impede and interfere with the administration of the company: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>”) at [19]. In this regard, apart from the merits of the claim, the court must also ultimately consider whether it is in the company’s interests for the action to be brought: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [54]. Within that inquiry, the court may take into account the character of the company, the availability of alternative remedies, the ability of the defendant to satisfy the claim, the costs and benefits of the proposed action and the effect of the litigation on the conduct of the company’s business among other considerations: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span> at [54] citing <span class="font-italic">Wong Lee Vui Willie v Li Qingyun</span> [2016] 1 SLR 696 (“<span class="font-italic">Willie Wong</span>”) at [50] and <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd and others</span> [2015] SGHC 145<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [153].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The focus of the second issue, that the proposed action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company, is an objective assessment of the legal merits of the claim (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [58]). That of the first issue, good faith, is the applicant’s honest or reasonable belief in the merits of the claim: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments </span>at [43]. The two issues are related. The strength of the claim is relevant under both heads. An applicant would have difficulty proving an honest or reasonable belief in the merits of the claim if the claim is frivolous (<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [55]) while an applicant would likely (but not necessarily) satisfy that requirement more easily by showing that the claim is meritorious (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20]). Further, as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Hock</span> at [20], “[t]he best way of demonstrating good faith is to show a legitimate claim which the directors are unreasonably reluctant to pursue with the appropriate vigour or at all.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 For the above reason, I considered the requirement that the action be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company first. In the present case, I found the claim to be a legitimate one. Because there was merit in the claim, I also found that the plaintiff was able to satisfy the requirement that she possessed a reasonable and honest belief in its merit. In this context, I took into account the family history of acrimony, which was not determinative of the issue. The various parties at hand were burdened with collateral interests in the positions that they took, but the plaintiff’s interests were aligned with those of the company, whereas the directors’ were not. I held therefore that the plaintiff was acting in good faith in her pursuit of the action.

The draft SOC characterises the non-collection of rent as breaches of the directors’ fiduciary duties to use reasonable diligence and to act in the company’s best interests. The proper discharge of these duties would have required WKY and OKS to review whether to maintain the rental arrangement with Double Ace and/or collect rental arrears owed from Double Ace to Trillion.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The directors made two arguments by way of defence to the claim. The first was that this non-collection of rent was a long-standing practice that began in 1985 when Datuk Wong was in charge and continued when Trillion was under the charge of WKN. They were, however, unable to articulate how a long-standing practice could, in legal terms, amount to a defence. Further, there was a change of circumstances once Double Ace ceased to trade. When WKN was in charge, Double Ace and Trillion were run as a single business, and while no rent was collected from Double Ace, Trillion’s operating expenses were run out of an active company whose income functioned as the lifeline of both companies. Once Double Ace was no longer active, notwithstanding that it was a related company, it was certainly arguable that WKY and OKS were under an obligation to review the rental arrangement, either by collecting rent and seeking the rental arrears, or by considering whether the Unit could otherwise be rented out to some other party. Their failure to do so could be characterised as a breach of the duty of care, skill and diligence, the duty to act with reasonable diligence, and/or the duty to act in the company’s best interests, as alleged by the plaintiff. This was a legitimate and arguable claim with a reasonable semblance of merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Associated with this, the directors argued that this arrangement was justified as Trillion and Double Ace were run as a single entity. Rent to be paid from Double Ace to Trillion would have been “akin to taking funds from a left pocket, and placing it into a right pocket”, needlessly increasing Double Ace’s cash outflow.

</div> This would have meant a build-up of cash in Trillion’s accounts, which would not have been used since Trillion was just an investment holding company. Further, when WKY took over Double Ace, he then started to give loans to cover Double Ace’s and Trillion’s operating expenses, and to require recovery of rent at that time would simply have meant shifting money from WKY to Double Ace to Trillion.

</div>
</div> There was no merit to this contention, because the situation arguably stemmed from the directors’ neglect of the affairs of Double Ace, which, prior to WKN’s demise, was a profitable trading company, and itself possessed an office unit with rental income. This unit became vacant in 2015: see <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn (CA)</span> at [71]. In any case, the extent to which Double Ace could be treated as a “single entity” with Trillion after WKN’s death and the transfer of shares to the plaintiff, the situation after Double Ace ceased trading, and the duties owed by Trillion’s directors who happened to be Double Ace’s directors as well, are all issues that should be ventilated and resolved at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 A last line of defence was that issue estoppel arose from the Court of Appeal’s findings in <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn (CA)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). The relevant portion of the Court of Appeal’s findings was at [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fourth, in relation to the Appellant’s concern that the amount owing to Trillion as reflected in Trillion’s financial statement dated 30 September 2016 was different from the amount Double Ace owed to other related parties as reflected in Double Ace’s financial statement dated 30 September 2016, we considered that the Appellant’s concerns were misplaced. In examining whether there has been a lack of probity on the part of Trillion’s shareholders and directors, the court would only be concerned with Trillion’s affairs and whether they were properly handled. On this, we note that the amount owing to Trillion by Double Ace for the rental of the Trillion unit had been in Trillion’s financial statements since 2009. It continued to increase year on year culminating in $890,170 in 2016. The Judge found, and we agreed, that this sum was due to the rental income payable by Double Ace which Trillion had not collected and which continued to accrue. Given that this was a situation that had started on WKN’s watch and been permitted by him for years, we agreed with the Judge that it could not evidence a lack of probity on the part of the current management.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 This argument fell away once the draft SOC was filed. The issue under consideration in <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn (CA)</span> was whether the company’s business had been run in a fraudulent manner by the directors. The plaintiff failed to establish their lack of probity to ground her application for the company to be wound up on that basis: see <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn (CA) </span>at [37]–[38] and [40]–[43].

</div> There are two other creditors who have filed proofs of debt. WKY has filed a proof of debt in the sum of $615,624.83 and the estate of Datuk Wong has filed a proof of debt for $1,058.53. On this account, the total debt would be $1,559,484.26. WKY was of the view that the rental arrears from the six-year period sought in the proposed claim would be repaid because the dividend from the sale of its asset, which WKY estimated at $850,000, would be paid out in proportion of the debt, as follows: Trillion at 60.456%, WKY at 39.476%, and the estate of Datuk Wong at 0.068%,

The amount the plaintiff claimed on behalf of Trillion for the six-year period was not analogous to the amount for which the proof of debt for $942,800.90 had been filed. Further, parties updated the court on 7 February 2020 that the liquidator had since clarified that the total dividend expected in Q2 of 2020 would be around $650,000, an even smaller sum than the $815,000 assumed by WKY in his calculations.

She argued that, in any case, there was no reason why the expenses should be set-off against the rental proceeds year by year or month by month for the six-year period, when, as a mathematical matter, because these expenses were less than the rental proceeds, they should be set-off against the prior rental arrears due.

For this reason, the defendants argued it was premature to grant leave. However, the limitation period continued to apply (see also [36] below). Increasing parts of the claim would be time-barred with the effluxion of time. Counsel for the plaintiff took the position that the plaintiff ought to be granted leave at this stage to file the writ on behalf of Trillion against WKY and OKS so that the action would not be time barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 All of the facts relating to liability for breaches of directors’ duties had crystallised. It was also clear that some amount would be recoverable as damages. The adjudication of the proof of debt related only to the issue of quantum. In the light of the potential time-bar guillotine, it was more practicable grant leave to commence the action but to impose a condition under s 216A(5) of the Companies Act that no assessment of damages be conducted prior to any adjudication of debt in Double Ace’s liquidation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is there sufficient benefit for Trillion?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The defendants also raised arguments suggesting that even if there was a meritorious claim, there would not be sufficient benefit to Trillion to justify leave under s 216A of the Companies Act.

</div> They argued that any sum of money obtained by Trillion in the proposed action would be used to pay off that debt, and Trillion itself would not benefit from the action. The plaintiff countered that the issue was irrelevant, on the basis that the focus of the application for leave is on the <span class="font-italic">interests of the company</span>, and the issue is whether the company “will stand to gain substantially in money or money’s worth”: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49]. I agreed with the plaintiff. Here, WKY’s loan was for the purchase of the Unit. If his loan is repaid, there will be greater profit subsequently for the company when the Unit is subsequently sold. The plaintiff also disputed the debt, on the basis that it was not proved, and barred by the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”). I should point out that the Court of Appeal found in <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Fong Kathryn (CA) </span>([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46] that the plaintiff, suing as WKN’s executrix, could not take a position contrary to that adopted by WKN regarding this liability when he managed the company, in that he had not disputed it at the time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the action would be detrimental to Trillion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Costs of the proposed litigation, the defendants argued, would outweigh the quantum of the proposed claim. This objection could not be sustained in the light of the plaintiff’s undertaking, furnished on affidavit dated 9 December 2019, to ensure that Trillion would be entirely insulated from any costs of the action. In the event of success, the plaintiff was willing to undertake not to claim any costs from Trillion above whatever party-and-party (“P&amp;P”) costs were ordered in its favour.

</div> There is therefore only the possibility of financial gain to Trillion in the proposed action. In order to give effect to those undertakings, conditions could be imposed under s 216A(5) of the Companies Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Costs, the defendants then argued, would also be incurred in terms of time and effort in order to prepare for the litigation. This concern was, in my view, overstated and not substantiated. Trillion is not an actively trading company but solely an investment holding company whose primary asset is the Unit. Because there are no other investments, focusing on the Unit would not result in distraction from other investments, and litigation would not disrupt any commercial relationships or any on-going enterprise. None of the other considerations in “the multi-factorial inquiry” (<span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments </span>at [54]; see [9] above) suggested that there was any reason to doubt that the claim would be in Trillion’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Therefore, the action would <span class="font-italic">prima</span> <span class="font-italic">facie</span> be in the interests of Trillion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I come, then, to the issue of good faith, in the context that I have found that the claim is a valid one. The defendants argued that the plaintiff lacked good faith, relying on the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the animosity between parties; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a miscellany of conduct alleged to point to the plaintiff’s bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I deal with each in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Animosity between parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The animosity between parties was common ground and accepted by the plaintiff in her affidavit in response to the application to cross-examine her. Since WKN’s passing in 2013, the extended Wong family has been involved in litigation in multiple jurisdictions. According to WKY, as of 31 July 2019, a total of 92 proceedings have been commenced across four jurisdictions, with the plaintiff responsible for commencing 57 of these proceedings (and six counterclaims). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 What, then, was the effect of the animosity between the parties? Animosity is only relevant if the plaintiff may be said to be abusing the statutory remedy: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([9] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [19]. In relation to the plaintiff’s alleged collateral purpose of pursuing a personal vendetta, the existence of a collateral purpose was not, in and of itself, a reason to find that the application for leave was not brought in good faith: see <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20]. Good faith is less dependent on motives and more on the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of the proposed action: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [16]. That is to say, “it is not the questionable motivations of the applicant <span class="font-italic">per se</span> that amounts to bad faith; instead bad faith may be established where questionable motivations constitute a personal purpose which will be pursued <span class="font-italic">at the expense of or in lieu of the company’s interests</span>” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [47].  A collateral purpose will establish bad faith only if it is at odds with or runs counter to the company’s interests, that is, if the action is brought on the basis of “<span class="font-italic">purely</span> personal considerations” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> at [20]. Where, however, as it is in the present case, there is an alignment between the company’s interests and the applicant’s interests, even if the applicant is pursuing a personal vendetta, the existence of that personal motive is not a sufficient basis for finding a lack of good faith. In the light of the objective merits of the claim, I found that the plaintiff possessed a reasonable belief that there is a good cause of action. Further, notwithstanding her dislike of WKY and OKS, her interests were sufficiently aligned with the interests of Trillion in the proposed action. She was not abusing the statutory remedy nor, by extension, the statutory corporate form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Balanced against that was the question of whether the directors were unreasonably resisting the leave application because of their own collateral purposes in avoiding liability in the face of the distinct possibility that they have, since 2013, neglected their statutory duties.  Previously, the directors resisted the winding up of Trillion in the prior litigation on the basis that it is an investment company with an investment asset. This was the only reason for the Court of Appeal’s decision to not wind up the company, and the single distinguishing factor between this company and Double Ace: <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn </span><span class="font-italic">(CA) </span>([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]–[68]. But they had not recovered rent for this sole asset. The plaintiff was entitled to question this. Here was a claim for six years of rental arrears, to which there did not appear to be much of a defence. While the defendants contended that this is a small claim, there would nevertheless be financial benefit to Trillion because the plaintiff has undertaken to insulate it from all costs. I would add that the draft SOC contains claims for damages and equitable compensation, and it would be open to the plaintiff to argue that, with Double Ace no longer requiring the Unit, the directors ought to have exercised at least some effort to find a tenancy for the Unit at prevailing market prices, which could well be higher than the $5,000 rental set in 1985.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The requirement for leave under s 216A of the Companies Act is premised on the assumption that the management of a company is best placed to bring actions on behalf of the company. These particular directors clearly have no intention of bringing any action against themselves despite the claim being a clear one. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20], one way to establish good faith is “to show a legitimate claim which the directors are unreasonably reluctant to pursue with the appropriate vigour or at all.” This was exactly the situation at hand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is there otherwise abuse of the statutory remedy?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I deal here in turn with various assertions made by the defendants to allege bad faith on the part of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">That the plaintiff was “not genuinely aggrieved”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Trillion argued that the plaintiff could not be “genuinely aggrieved” because, as a shareholder, she stood to gain nothing from the intended action as the money would first be paid to the creditors.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, this argument was misplaced. The requirement that the applicant must be “genuinely aggrieved” was first used in <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>([9] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [19] where Tay Yong Kwang J spoke of the protection of “genuinely aggrieved minority interests”. It was clear that the context was of company interests, albeit that of the minority. Subsequent use in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [30], and by <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [44] also did not highlight any need for personal gain or personal benefit on the part of the plaintiff. In the Canadian case of <span class="font-italic">Richardson Greenshields of Canada Limited v Kalmacoff et al</span> (1995) 22 OR (3d) 577 at 586–587 (quoted with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [15]), Sydney Robins JA made the point that personal interests were irrelevant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he extent of [the appellant shareholder’s] stake, monetary or otherwise, in the outcome of proceedings is of little weight in deciding whether it has met the good faith test applicable in the present circumstances. … Whether it is motivated by altruism, as the motions court judge suggested, or by self-interest, as the respondents suggest, is beside the point. Assuming, as I suppose, it is the latter, self-interest is hardly a stranger to the security or investment business. Whatever the reason, there are legitimate legal questions raised here that call for judicial resolution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">That the plaintiff framed the claim to avoid liability on the part of WKN</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The derivative action as framed by the plaintiff pertains only to the rental arrangement from June 2013 to May 2019. The defendants pointed out that this rental arrangement was put in place by Datuk Wong, and WKN in continuing the practice was equally in breach of his duties as WKY and OKS were in breach of theirs, and therefore that his estate should also be included as a defendant in the derivative action. They submitted that the failure to do so showed that the application was not brought in good faith. Even if this were true, it would not detract from the valid claim at hand. It fails in any event given the plaintiff’s explanation that any claim in relation to WKN would have been time-barred, as the proposed claim is for the lack of due care. A six-year limitation period would apply for such breaches of fiduciary duties under s 6(7) of the Limitation Act: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd</span>”) at [53]–[54]; <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another</span> [2013] 1 SLR 173 at [48]–[51]. It is only where the claim is one for “fraud or fraudulent breach of trust” that the exception under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act applies: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd</span> at [53], and the draft SOC makes clear that fraud is not alleged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s conduct in the lead-up to the application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendants also made three arguments concerning the plaintiff’s conduct in the lead-up to the application, which they alleged showed a lack of good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, the defendants argued that the issue of rental arrears had not been raised in the prior applications for winding up that culminated in <span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong </span><span class="font-italic">Kathryn (CA) </span>([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) even though the plaintiff found out about the rental arrangement in October 2017 when affidavits were exchanged.

</div> There was no need for the plaintiff to raise the issue at the shareholders’ meetings. Compliance with s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act was sufficient.

</div> This argument ignored the fact that the will empowered the plaintiff to defer the stipulated transfers. It includes a “power to postpone such sale, calling in and conversion for so long as [his] Trustee [<span class="font-italic">viz</span>., the plaintiff] shall in their absolute discretion think fit”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applications for cross-examination of parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It would be appropriate for me to deal, before I conclude, with the applications filed by the parties for cross-examination in Summonses Nos 6097, 6098 and 6392 of 2019. When the matter first came before me, the plaintiff argued that without the benefit of cross-examination, the defendants could not question her assertion, made on oath in her affidavit, as to her good faith. Trillion and the directors then followed on with applications to cross-examine the plaintiff while the matter was adjourned for the plaintiff to file an affidavit to furnish the undertakings which her counsel had proposed at the hearing and to explain the proposed claim with a draft statement of claim. In response, the plaintiff filed a cross-application to cross-examine the directors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 After considering the various issues, I decided that cross-examination was not necessary. It was clear from the affidavits that each party filed in support of their own applications and in response to the other’s applications that the relationship between the plaintiff and the directors were extremely acrimonious. The burden of proving good faith was borne by the plaintiff. In the present case, I was satisfied that she had discharged that burden by affidavit and argument because an assessment of the claim and the undertakings she furnished showed that she possessed honest and reasonable grounds for belief in the financial benefit it would bring to Trillion. Further, any collateral purpose she may have was sufficiently consistent with Trillion’s interests such that the application could be said to have been made in good faith. There was no particular issue raised by the defendants that formed a sufficient basis to contradict or question that conclusion, and accordingly there was no need for the defendants to cross-examine the plaintiff. I should clarify that after consideration, I did not find myself in agreement with the plaintiff’s position that the defendants could not question her good faith without cross-examination. They could do so on the grounds of sufficient objective evidence that did not require explanation by cross-examination.  In the present case, however, such evidence was not raised. As for the plaintiff’s application to cross-examine the directors, it was contingent upon her being cross-examined, which I have found to be unnecessary. The three applications for cross-examination were dismissed with no order on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Therefore, I concluded that the requirements under s 216A(3) of the Companies Act were satisfied. Leave was granted to the plaintiff to bring an action on behalf of Trillion against the directors for breach of duties. The plaintiff was authorised to have full charge and control over the conduct of the action and any execution proceedings thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The following conditions were imposed pursuant to s 216A(5) of the Companies Act.
