<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">    This was an appeal against the decision of Justice Kan Ting

Chiu, who convicted the appellant, Yeo Kang Oh (Yeo) of an offence unders 5(1)(a) read with s

5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (the Act) and sentenced him to death.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The charge</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The charge against Yeo reads as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">You, Yeo Kang Oh, are charged that you on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of

  January 2001, at about 6:10 p.m., at Blk 9, Toa Payoh Lorong 7 #04-327, Singapore (the Toa

  Payoh flat), did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule

  to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of

  trafficking, 25.55 grams of diamorphine, without having any authorisation under the said Act or

  the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a)

  read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punishable under section 33 of

  the aforesaid Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The prosecutions case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The prosecution presented the following facts. About two months prior to Yeos

arrest, he met Tan Jek Cheng (Tan). The pair were friends who shared a common interest in

abusing heroin. At that time, Yeo needed a place to stay because he was trying to hide from law

enforcement officers as he had skipped a scheduled urine test with the police. Tan owned the Toa

Payoh flat and he offered Yeo accommodation in one of the rooms of the flat. Tan himself stayed in

the utility room. The pair smoked heroin together in the utility room, using drugs and equipment

supplied by Yeo.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 Yeo wanted to traffic in heroin to maintain his addiction. On 26 January 2001,

he went to Woodlands Central to meet a drugs supplier called Xiao Tee. He bought one pound of heroin

from this person, with the intention to traffic in it. Subsequently, Yeo returned to the Toa Payoh

flat and hid the heroin in his own room. He did not tell Tan about his purchase.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The next day, Yeo returned to Woodlands to pay Xiao Tee for the drugs. This

time Tan drove him there in a van, bearing registration number GQ 2429 L. Yeo paid for the rental of

this van for the Chinese New Year period to avoid the inconvenience of hiring a cab during the

festive season. Tan was told that Yeo was meeting a friend but did not know who this friend was or

the purpose of the meeting. Tan waited in the car park for Yeo while he met Xiao Tee. After Yeo paid

Xiao Tee, he returned to the van and the pair drove off. They had lunch and proceeded to Yeos own

flat in Jalan Membina. At about 5 p.m., they left the flat and returned to the Toa Payoh flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 When they reached the car park adjourning the Toa Payoh flat, Yeo told Tan to

go back to Jalan Membina to pick up his wife, See Han Kook (See) and his grandson. Tan

complied and left the car park without going up to his flat. After they parted, Yeo went up to the

flat and transferred the drugs that he hid in his room to the utility room. He started re-packing

the drugs into empty sachets for sale in the utility room because he did not want See to find out

about his drug trafficking activities and was afraid that she would discover his secret if he packed

them in his own room.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 Meanwhile, Tan picked up See and her grandson from Jalan Membina. They were

travelling in the van when a party of CNB officers stopped them at the junction of Lorong 6 and 7,

Toa Payoh. The officers arrested Tan and See, on the suspicion that they were trafficking in heroin.

Some heroin was found in the van. Tan admitted that he owned them and that they were for his

personal consumption. The officers also ascertained Tans address and obtained the keys to his

flat from him. Subsequently, they proceeded to raid his flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 On reaching the Toa Payoh flat, the officers tried to gain access to it using

Tans keys. Yeo was still in the flat and when he discovered that some officers were about to

enter the flat, he armed himself with a chopper in each of his hands. He threatened the officers

with the choppers and caused them to back off. He then went to the kitchen and discovered that there

were more officers stationed at the bottom of the block. He re-entered the living room but retreated

to the kitchen again. He went to the kitchen window and jumped down, falling four storeys. He

intended to kill himself as he realised the seriousness of being caught with the drugs in the

utility room.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 After Yeo jumped down, the officers entered the flat and found some drugs on

the floor of the utility room. They also found a straw of heroin in the kitchen and some drug

paraphernalia in the utility room. The officers secured the premises and handed it over to the

Investigating Officer, ASP Daniel Tan. ASP Tan brought the drugs recovered from the flat to the

Department of Scientific Services for analysis. Subsequently, he received from them eight reports

pertaining to the drugs found in the utility room, which revealed that the drugs found in the

utility room were 25.55 grams of diamorphine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The prosecution relied largely on four statements that Yeo made after his

arrest. Yeo did not challenge the admissibility of these statements. In particular, in his cautioned

statement, he admitted to the ownership of <i>all</i> 25.55 grams of diamorphine found in the

utility room and exonerated See and Tan completely. His other statements also did not implicate

either of them. They explained, among other things, that he owned the drugs for the purposes of

trafficking in them.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The defences case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 Yeos defence was that he was not guilty of trafficking in all 25.55 grams

of heroin as he only owned half of the drugs in the utility room while Tan owned the other half.

Furthermore, Yeo said that he intended to traffic in only half of his own share and use the rest for

personal consumption. His counsel argued that he should only be liable for the trafficking of one

quarter of the heroin found in the utility room.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 Yeos version of the facts was as follows. On 26 January 2001, he and Tan

went to Woodlands to collect drugs. He placed the drugs in the utility room with Tans knowledge.

The next morning, Tan bought empty sachets to contain the drugs for trafficking. At about 12 p.m.,

both of them returned to Woodlands together and while Tan waited in the van for him, he went to pay

Xiao Tee for the drugs. Tan contributed $1,000 and Yeo raised the other $4,200 required to pay for

the drugs. Both of them had an agreement to split the pound of heroin equally. Yeo was willing to

let Tan have a half share on credit, although he only paid $1,000 initially. Tan agreed to pay for

the rest of his share in the drugs in instalments.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 After paying for the drugs, the pair went for lunch and proceeded to the Jalan

Membina flat. They returned to the Toa Payoh flat at around 3-4 p.m and spent some time there

together. Tan only left the flat at about 5 p.m. to fetch See and her grandson.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 This version of the facts contradicted his own statements to the CNB in two

material areas. First, that Tan owned a half share in the drugs pursuant to an agreement the pair

had made and was aware of all the arrangements that were made in relation to their purchase.

Secondly, that Tan returned to his flat on 27 January before picking up See.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 Yeo accepted that his statements were admissible. However, he explained that,

although he made them without threat, inducement or promise, they contained falsehoods. With respect

to the discrepancies as to Tans involvement and ownership of the drugs, he explained that he lied

because he wanted to ensure that his wife would not be implicated for drug trafficking. He believed

that See would be released if he admitted to the sole ownership of the drugs in the utility room and

Tan admitted to the ownership of the drugs in the van. With respect to the discrepancies as to

whether Tan was in the flat with him on 27 January, he explained that he forgot to mention this to

the investigating officer as he was too nervous at the time.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 Kan J held that the prosecution had proven the charge against Yeo beyond

reasonable doubt. The judge rejected Yeos defence primarily because he had admitted fully to the

charge in the clearest terms in his statements to the CNB and he did not challenge the admissibility

of these statements at trial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 The judge gave full weight to the statements as he believed that the

statements contained the truth. He gave two reasons for rejecting Yeos contention that he lied in

the statements about the ownership of the drugs to exonerate his wife. First, it was unnecessary for

Yeo to lie about the ownership of the drugs in the flat for fear that See may be implicated by Tan

for the drugs in the van. Yeo admitted that during the course of investigations and the recording of

his statements, he had been told that See had been absolved of any liability for the drugs in the

van since Tan had already admitted to the sole ownership of those drugs. Secondly, it was equally

unnecessary for Yeo to claim sole ownership of the drugs in the flat to exonerate his wife of any

liability for the drugs in the flat. Implicating Tan was in no way inconsistent with Sees

innocence. The judge also noted that during the course of investigations, Yeo had many opportunities

to implicate Tan, if he were really responsible for half of the drugs, but failed to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 In addition, Kan J found that Yeos argument that he only owned half of the

drugs could not be sustained because his counsel did not put it to Tan that he had made arrangement

with Yeo to take the drugs on credit and pay for them in instalments. The judge also disbelieved Yeos

contention that Tan knew about the drugs in the utility room because he went up to his flat with Yeo

on 27 January 2001. He did not believe that Yeo could forget to mention such an important fact in

his statements simply because he forgot.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 The judge also rejected Yeos contention that he intended to traffic in only

half of his own share, leaving the rest for personal consumption. This was because such a contention

was inconsistent with his statement to the CNB where he claimed that he bought the drugs to traffic

in them. Furthermore, his testimony on his consumption rate varied substantially. The judge

concluded that, even if some of the drugs were for personal consumption, they were principally for

trafficking.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 The grounds of appeal were substantially the same as those canvassed at the

trial below. There were two main issues. First, whether Yeo lied in his statements to the CNB about

the ownership of the drugs. Secondly, whether the judge erred in failing to properly consider the

evidence which supports Yeos defence that Tan owned half of the drugs. Yeo did not appeal against

the judges finding that the defence of consumption was not made out.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 The issues raised in this appeal solely revolved around questions of fact

which were more appropriately decided by the trial judge. The principles governing an appellate

courts decision to overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge are clear. In <i>PP v Ng Ai

Tiong </i><nobr>[2000] 1 SLR 454</nobr>, Yong Pung How CJ set out the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">It is trite law that an appellate court will generally be reluctant to overturn

  the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they turn on the trial judge`s assessment of

  the credibility and veracity of witnesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Thus, we would dismiss this appeal unless Yeo showed that the judges findings

were <i>clearly wrong</i>. (see also <i>Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 656</nobr> and <i>Tan

Hung Yeoh v PP</i> <nobr>[1999] 3 SLR 93</nobr>).</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The veracity of the statements made at the CNB</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 Yeo did not address the reasons given by the trial judge for rejecting his

contention that he incriminated himself in the statements to exonerate his wife. He merely

reiterated that the "<i>only</i> thing he could do to completely shield his wife from

prosecution would be to admit to sole possession of the drugs in the flat". No reason was given

as to why incriminating Tan would not achieve the same result of exonerating the wife.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 There was no evidence that the trial judge was clearly wrong in his finding

that the statements that Yeo gave the investigating officer contained the truth regarding the

ownership of the drugs. On the contrary, this finding was amply supported by the two reasons given

by the judge. First, See would also not be implicated for the drugs in the van if Tan was implicated

for the drugs in the flat. Yeo admitted that he had already been told, during the course of

investigations, that Tan had admitted to the ownership of the drugs in the van and absolved See.

Secondly, it was unnecessary for Yeo to admit to the sole ownership of the drugs to shield See since

incriminating Tan only would still exonerate See from the drugs in the flat.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 Furthermore, Yeo also admitted that there was no prior arrangement between Tan

and himself that, if he were to take the blame for the drugs in the flat, Tan would exonerate See

for the drugs in the van. We did not believe that Yeo would falsely incriminate himself of a capital

offence and completely exonerate Tan when he knew or should have known that implicating Tan would

not have any effect on Sees liability for the drugs in the van and the flat.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Analysis of the evidence that Yeo relies on</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 Yeo contended that the judge should have drawn the inference that Tan had an

"active share" in his drug trafficking activities based on the following facts that he

presented. First, Tan was a heroin addict who was in need of money to support his addiction.

Secondly, Tan owned the digital weighing scale needed for packing the drugs for trafficking.

Thirdly, Tan allowed him to stay in the Toa Payoh flat, even though Tan knew that he was involved in

drug trafficking. Lastly, Tan participated in obtaining the drugs by driving Yeo to Woodlands to pay

for the drugs, in a van rented in his name.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 Throughout the appeal, Yeos counsel merely contended that Tan had an

"active share" in the drugs but did not quantify the share which Tan allegedly owns. Such

a failure to establish the quantity of drugs owned by Tan, and thus, Yeo, was determinative of this

appeal as no reasonable doubts were raised as to whether Yeo owned not more than 15 grams of

diamorphine and thus was innocent of the charge against him. In any event, the trial judge found

that Yeo never made an agreement to share the drugs equally with Tan and the records did not show

that the trial judge was clearly wrong in this finding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 The conclusion that we drew in the previous paragraph was sufficient to

dismiss this appeal. However, we went on to consider whether Yeos contention that Tan had an

"active share" in the drugs was made out. We concluded that this contention should also be

rejected. During the course of the trial, only one of the four alleged facts that Yeo relied on to

make out his contention that Tan had a share in the drugs was established. This established fact was

that Tan was a heroin addict and he was in financial difficulties. However, this was not, of itself,

sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecutions case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 In the trial below, it was not put to Tan that he owned the digital weighing

scale needed for the packing of the drugs for trafficking. In fact, no questions were asked of Tan

by defence counsel relating to the ownership of such a scale. Thus, this allegation had not been

verified and could not be used in support of Yeos case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 Yeos counsel also did not establish that Tan knew of Yeos drug

trafficking activities. No questions were asked as to whether Tan was aware that Yeo trafficked in

drugs in general. As for the present instance of drug trafficking, i.e. that Yeo bought a pound of

heroin to traffic in and stored it in the flat, Tan testified that he did not know about it. In

addition, he testified that, although he knew that Yeo had a ready source of drugs, he did not know

anything about this source as he did not want to question Yeo on it for fear of being thought to be

an informant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 Tan also denied that he knew about and participated in the procurement of the

drugs by sending Yeo to Woodlands Central. He testified that he only knew that Yeo wanted to go to

Woodlands to meet a friend. He was not told and did not ask Yeo who the friend was and the purpose

of the meeting. He did not see who Yeos friend was either because he was waiting for Yeo in the

car park while the latter went to meet Xiao Tee.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 Tan withstood cross-examination on all the points mentioned in the preceding

two paragraphs and thus his testimony that he did not have a share in the drugs was accepted by the

trial judge. On the other hand, Yeo did not provide reasonable explanations as to the

inconsistencies between his oral testimony and his statements to the CNB. The trial judge accepted

the veracity of the latter and rejected Yeos oral testimony as to Tans knowledge and

participation in Yeos drug trafficking activities. There was no evidence to show that the trial

judge was clearly wrong in preferring Tans testimony in court to Yeos and concluding that Tan

did not have an active share in the drugs.</p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 In the light of our findings above, we found that the trial judge rightly

convicted Yeo of the offence as charged. We therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction and

sentence.</p>
