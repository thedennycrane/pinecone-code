<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the learned assistant
                    registrar Eunice Chua’s (“AR Chua”) decision on 14 May 2012
                    allowing the respondents’ (“the Respondents”) application
                    under Summons No 1819 of 2012 (“SUM 1819/2012”) to
                    strike out the appellant’s (“the Appellant”) claim and enter
                    judgment against the Appellant. The Appellant appealed against my decision
                    dismissing the appeal. I set out below the grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On or about 8 December 2006, the Appellant
                    entered into four separate contracts (in similar terms) with the second to fifth
                    respondents (“the Second to Fifth Respondents”) respectively
                    (“the contracts”) under which the Appellant agreed to sell to each
                    Respondent various alcohol products during the contract period running from 1
                    January 2007 to 31 December 2008 (“the contract
                    period”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant commenced an action against the
                    Second to Fifth Respondents on or about 22 October 2009, claiming for loss and
                    damages of $5,818,973.48 (this being the sum of the balance of the contract
                    value of each contract as a result of alleged breaches of contract by the Second
                    to Fifth Respondents) and the sum of $699,308.99 representing the refund for
                    certain Advertising and Promotion Funds (“A&amp;P funds”) which
                    the Appellant had provided to the Second to Fifth Respondents in support of all
                    marketing activities related to the Appellant’s products. The
                    Appellant’s position was that the claims were joint and several in respect
                    of the Second to Fifth Respondents. The Appellant’s claim against the
                    first respondent (“the First Respondent”) (the ultimate investment
                    holding company of the Second to Fifth Respondents) was for loss and damages
                    arising from the breach of the contracts by reason of an alleged oral agreement
                    between the Appellant and the First Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The paragraph of the Appellant’s Statement
                    of Claim (Amendment No 4) (“ASOC4”) from which the dispute in
                    discovery documents arose is reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    The Plaintiffs will give credit for their costs
                            and expense to be incurred had the Defendants fulfilled in full the
                            Agreement and the four Contracts particularized herein, to be taken into
                            consideration in their claim for damages resulting from the
                            Defendants’ breach of the Agreement and the four Contracts, to be
                            assessed.</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    Had the Agreement and the four Contracts been
                                fulfilled in full by the Defendants, the Plaintiffs would have to
                                incur costs of purchase, shipping, delivery, taxes, insurances,
                                storage charges, custom and excise duties for the volume of their
                                products to be supplied under the Agreement and the four Contracts,
                                as well as the Plaintiff’s’ costs of doing business in
                                Singapore to supply, stock and deliver the said volume of their
                                products which the Defendants did not purchase, in breach of the
                                Agreement and the four Contracts, as particularized in paragraph 18
                                herein.</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(4)    The Plaintiffs’ average gross profit
                                margin during the period of the Agreement and the four Contracts
                                (that is for the year 2007 to the year 2008) is <em>an estimate of 49.64% of the total value of the
                                    Plaintiffs’ products </em><em>purchased by the Defendants</em> in the sum of
                                $4,681,026.52, after taking into consideration their costs and
                                expense incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(5)    The Plaintiffs aver that had they fulfilled
                                the Agreement and the four Contracts in full, the Plaintiffs would
                                also have made an <em>average gross profit of 49.64%
                                    of the total volume of the Plaintiffs’ products</em>
                                which the Defendants did not purchase in breach of contract, of the
                                sum of $5,818,973.48, which is estimated at
                            $2,888,538.44.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Based on the above pleadings, the Appellant was
                    required to disclose the documents which were used to arrive at the figure of
                    49.64% representing the Appellant’s average gross profit. These would
                    include documents evidencing the net sales, costs and expenses incurred, and
                    gross profit made in relation to supplying alcohol products to each of the
                    Second to Fifth Respondents pursuant to the contracts. As such, the Respondents
                    applied for specific discovery of the relevant documents in Summons No 5029 of
                    2010 (“SUM 5029/2010”). AR Chua, who heard the application, made
                    the following orders (“the Specific Discovery Orders”) on 8
                    December 2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant to file and serve on
                        the Respondents an affidavit, stating whether it has or has had at any time
                        in its possession, custody or power, the documents set out in Annex A
                        of SUM 5029/2010, by 5 January 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant to file and serve on the
                        Respondents a Supplementary List of Documents, listing the documents set out
                        in Annex A of SUM 5029/2010 which are in its possession, power or
                        custody, by 12 January 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellant to allow inspection of the documents listed
                        in the said Supplementary List of Documents; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Appellant to provide the
                        Respondents with a copy each of the documents specified in the said
                        Supplementary List of Documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There was no appeal against the Specific
                    Discovery Orders. The Appellant nevertheless failed to file the said affidavit
                    by 5 January 2011 and the said Supplementary List of Documents by 12 January
                    2011. During a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on 27 January 2011,
                    the learned senior assistant registrar Ng Teng Teng Cornie (“SAR
                    Ng”) ordered the Appellant to comply with the Specific Discovery Orders
                    by 10 February 2011. The Appellant subsequently filed and served its Third
                    Supplementary List of Documents (“SLOD3”) and an affidavit
                    verifying SLOD3 on or about 10 February 2011, but failed to furnish copies of
                    the documents listed in SLOD3. The Respondents then reminded the Appellant by
                    way of a letter dated 11 February 2011 to furnish those documents by 17 February
                    2011. However, the Appellant did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In or about April 2011, the parties commenced
                    settlement discussions, but the discussions eventually came to a halt. The exact
                    point in time at which those negotiations broke down was disputed, although the
                    Respondents submitted that this was around August 2011. On 5 December 2011, the
                    Respondents sent another letter asking that the Appellant comply with the
                    Specific Discovery Orders and provide copies of the documents in SLOD3. The
                    Appellant did not comply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       When the parties appeared before SAR Ng for a
                    PTC on 12 January 2012, almost a year after her order on 27 January 2011, she
                    was informed that the Specific Discovery Orders had not been fully complied
                    with. She then made an order that unless the Appellant complied with the
                    Specific Discovery Orders and furnished copies of all the documents listed in
                    SLOD3 by 4pm on 9 February 2012, the Appellant’s case was to be dismissed
                    with costs to the Respondents to be taxed or agreed (“the First Unless
                    Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant appealed against the First Unless
                    Order in Registrar’s Appeal No 32 of 2012 (“RA 32/2012”) and
                    this was heard by Lai Siu Chiu J on 6 February 2012. Lai J gave a final
                    extension of time for the Appellant to comply with the Specific Discovery
                    Orders, granting an unless order for the Appellant to fully comply with the
                    Specific Discovery Orders and provide copies of all documents in SLOD3 to the
                    Respondents by 4pm on 20 February 2012, in default of which the
                    Appellant’s claim against the Respondents would be dismissed without
                    further order with costs to the Respondents to be taxed or agreed (“the
                    Varied Unless Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant served its Fourth Supplementary
                    List of Documents (“SLOD4”) on the Respondents and furnished
                    copies of the documents listed in it on 17 February 2012. On 23 February 2012,
                    the Appellant sent a letter to the Respondents explaining how the SLOD4
                    documents were relied on to compute the Appellant’s profit margin. At a
                    PTC before SAR Ng on 1 March 2012, she allowed the Respondents three weeks to
                    review the documents and to seek clarification or make further requests by 22
                    March 2012. In a letter dated 13 March 2012, the Respondents sought
                    clarification with regard to items 1 and 2 of SLOD3, as well as the SLOD4
                    documents, whilst reserving their rights with respect to the question whether
                    the Appellant had complied with the Varied Unless Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Appellant’s solicitors sent a letter
                    of clarification on 26 March 2012 to the Respondents’ solicitors. On 27
                    March 2012, the Appellant then served its Fifth Supplementary List of Documents
                    (“SLOD5”) on the Respondents to further clarify its position on
                    the 26 March 2012 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At a PTC hearing on 29 March 2012, SAR Ng
                    directed the Appellant to provide the documents listed in SLOD5 by 4pm on 30
                    March 2012, and adjourned the PTC hearing to 19 April 2012 so that the
                    Respondents could review the Appellant’s clarifications and documents. The
                    SLOD5 documents were furnished to the Respondents on 30 March
                2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After reviewing all the documents and
                    clarifications, the Respondents were not satisfied that the Appellant had
                    complied with the Varied Unless Order, and made an application under SUM
                    1819/2012 for the Appellant’s claim to be dismissed for failure to fully
                    comply with the Varied Unless Order. This was heard by AR Chua on 14 and 25 May
                    2012. She found that the Appellant had failed to fully comply with the Varied
                    Unless Order, and accordingly dismissed the Appellant’s claim against the
                    Respondents without further order. I heard the Appellant’s appeal against
                    the dismissal of its claim over two days, on 30 and 31 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     AR Chua made the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant had failed to comply
                        with the terms of the Specific Discovery Orders and had taken the position
                        that it was not necessary to produce the documents
                    sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was not
                        appropriate to grant an extension of time, which was requested for orally at
                        the hearing. The Appellant had shown a cavalier attitude in saying that if
                        the court took the view that its discovery obligation required disclosure of
                        all the source documents, the Appellant would then apply for an extension of
                        time to produce those documents. The Appellant had ample opportunity to seek
                        clarification from the court as to the scope of its discovery obligations
                        and to make a formal application for an extension of time but had failed to
                        do so. There was also no basis for the distinction raised by the Appellant
                        between a “housekeeping” unless order and one that was made
                        pursuant to an application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant’s position was that it had
                    already given discovery of all substantial documents relevant to the dispute,
                    but its claim had been struck out due to a technical point raised by the
                    Respondents in their “incessant interlocutory applications”. The
                    Appellant maintained that if one were to consider the circumstances under which
                    the Specific Discovery Orders, First Unless Order and Varied Unless Order were
                    made, it was not the case that it had repeatedly breached these orders after
                    having been given the chance to comply. The Appellant then cited <em>Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em>
                    [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>Wellmix
                    Organics</em>”) where Andrew Phang Boon Leong J decided that
                    the courts would only enforce unless orders if a party breached the order
                    intentionally and either contumeliously or contumaciously (at [79], [103] and
                    [107]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79    ... notwithstanding the operation of normal
                            contractual principles to consent unless orders, the courts ought still
                            to have a residuary discretion to decide whether, in the circumstances
                            of the particular case, <em>enforcement</em> of the
                            consent unless order concerned ought to be effected. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103    ... I should point out, nevertheless, that in the
                            light of the conclusion I had arrived at earlier – that the unless
                            order was <em>not</em> a <em>consent</em> unless order but, rather, an
                            “ordinary” unless order – it was necessary, in any
                            event, to ascertain whether or not the defendant’s breach in the
                            context of the present proceedings was intentionally contumacious or
                            contumelious ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">107    Like the learned assistant registrar, I find that
                            the defendant’s action, whilst intentional, was neither
                            contumelious nor contumacious. Indeed, it seemed clear to me that there
                            was a misunderstanding that not only contributed to the absence of an
                            agreement but which also led him to commit a merely technical breach of
                            the order, having regard to the misunderstanding between the defendant
                            and the plaintiff. These circumstances would themselves also constitute,
                            in my view, extraneous circumstances, bearing in mind that this concept
                            is neither mandatory nor writ in stone. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Hence, the court would recognise situations
                    where, despite the otherwise impeccable legal status of a consent unless order,
                    the conduct by the party in breach may be insufficient to warrant the
                    enforcement of that order. The threshold for enforcement was not merely a
                    question of whether the conduct was contumelious or contumacious, but whether it
                    was contumelious or contumacious to <em>such an extreme
                        degree</em> that the consent unless order ought to operate (at [100]).
                    In that case, Phang J found that there was an unless order (not a consent
                    unless order), and while the defendant’s action was intentional, it was
                    neither contumelious nor contumacious. Rather, it was merely a technical breach
                    by the defendant due to a misunderstanding. As a result, it did not warrant the
                    harsh consequence of a striking out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Accordingly, the Appellant argued that its
                    breach, if any, did not warrant the harshest of consequences ensuing as a result
                    of the breach. After all, it was clear from the affidavits of Giorgio Ferarri
                    (the managing director of the Appellant) and Bernard Lim Miang (a director of
                    the Respondents) that the parties had entered into protracted and without
                    prejudice negotiations to try to settle the two ongoing suits between them from
                    the time that the Specific Discovery Orders were made. The Appellant’s
                    failure to reply to the Respondents’ solicitors’ letters of reminder
                    was due to the Appellant’s pre-occupation with negotiating a global
                    settlement. Hence, the Appellant’s conduct between December 2010 and
                    January 2012 could hardly be said to be deliberate or intentional, or without
                    excuse or justification, or involving repeated non-compliance (whether
                    contumelious or contumacious). Moreover, the First Unless Order was given by SAR
                    Ng despite the fact that it was not applied for and was thus intended more as a
                    housekeeping direction. According to the Appellant, this background was
                    important in the assessment of whether the Appellant’s behaviour was
                    indeed contumacious and/or contumelious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant argued that it had in fact
                        <em>fully complied</em> with the Specific Discovery
                    Orders and the Varied Unless Order. Based on the exact wording of the Specific
                    Discovery Orders, there was no clear and specific direction or order that the
                    Appellant had to give discovery of <em>all</em> the
                    documents set out in Annex A of SUM 5029/2010 filed on 25 October 2010. The
                    correspondence between the solicitors following the Varied Unless Order
                    explained how the Appellant had relied on the documents (which had already been
                    given to the Respondents) set out in SLOD3, SLOD4 and SLOD5 to compute its
                    profit margin, as well as the manner and extent to which those documents had
                    complied with the Specific Discovery Orders in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Respondents’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Respondents submitted that it was evident
                    that the Appellant had not fully complied with the Varied Unless Order. This was
                    clear from the Appellant’s failure to produce all documents evidencing
                    and/or relating to the Appellant’s actual gross profit, net sales and cost
                    of goods in relation to the supply of its products to each of the Second to
                    Fifth Respondents from 2007 to 2008 (figures which the Appellant used to arrive
                    at its average gross profit of 49.67%). This was in contravention of the
                    Specific Discovery Orders and the subsequent Varied Unless Order to furnish all
                    documents listed in SLOD3 by 4pm on 20 February 2012. Such a failure alone would
                    be sufficient to warrant the Appellant’s action being struck out. In
                        <em>Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew &amp; Napier</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 252, Lee Seiu Kin JC stated at [20]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>all that is needed is to determine whether the
                            plaintiffs have complied with the terms of the unless order</em>.
                        If they have not, then the action is dismissed without further order and if
                        the defendants extract the order, as they have, then it is perfected. ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Since the terms of the Varied Unless Order
                    were not complied with, the Respondents submitted that the Appellant’s
                    action should be dismissed. After all, despite having the opportunity to address
                    its failure to comply with the Varied Unless Order, the Appellant nevertheless
                    failed to provide any explanation and/or chose not to address specifically the
                    manner in which it claimed that it had given full compliance. Thus, in the
                    absence of good reasons, disobedience of a peremptory order should be treated as
                    contumelious conduct which would justify the striking out of the
                    Appellant’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The law on the breach of an unless order is
                    clear: non-compliance with an unless order would <em>prima
                        facie</em> result in the action being dismissed or the defence being
                    struck out. This was explained in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 24/16/2
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... An “unless” order spells out the consequences of failure
                        to comply with its terms, and disobedience to such an order is likely to be
                        held to be contumelious behaviour, resulting in the dismissal of the action
                        or striking out of the defence. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Unless there are good reasons for
                    non-compliance, disobedience of a peremptory order will be considered
                    contumelious conduct justifying a striking out. This was stated by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew</em> [1997] 3
                    SLR(R) 576 where L P Thean JA held at [101]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that
                        Mr Tang had intentionally flouted the court orders. <b><em>In
                            the absence of good reasons, disobedience of a peremptory order is
                            generally to be treated as contumelious conduct</em></b> (<em>per</em> Lord Diplock in <em>Tolley v
                            Morris</em> [1979] 1 WLR 592 at 603) <b>and
                            </b><b><em>such contumelious disobedience justified
                            striking out Mr Tang’s defences</em></b><b>.</b> In our judgment, Goh Joon Seng J was fully entitled
                        to make the orders which he did. The appeals against his orders are thus
                        dismissed. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Syed Mohamed Abdul
                        Muthaliff </em><em>v Arjan </em><em>Bhisham </em><em>Chotrani</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 361 (“<em>Syed Mohamed</em>”),
                    the Court of Appeal decided that the court should exercise its discretion
                    whether to grant an extension of time for compliance with an unless order in the
                    light of all the circumstances. The facts of each case should be scrutinised,
                    and previous cases were mere guidelines, not conditions precedent. In
                    particular, the court would decide if the failure to adhere to the unless order
                    was <em>intentional and contumelious</em>. In this respect,
                    the court should not be astute to find excuses for such failure since obedience
                    to orders of the court was the foundation on which its authority rested. The
                    onus would thus be on the offending party to demonstrate that he had in fact
                    made positive efforts to comply and that he was not intentionally ignoring or
                    flouting the order but was constrained by extraneous circumstances. In addition,
                    the prejudice caused to the other party and the proportionality of depriving the
                    offending party of a determination on the merits must also be taken into
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While the case before me did not concern an
                    application for an extension of time like that in <em>Syed
                        Mohamed</em>, the principles enunciated in <em>Syed
                        Mohamed</em> were still applicable as the Court of Appeal was
                    examining the nature of unless orders in general. In fact, these principles were
                    applied in <em>Changhe International Investments Pte Ltd v Dexia
                        BIL Asia Singapore Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 598, where the Court of
                    Appeal held that the defaulter had to give proper explanation for its failure to
                    comply and show that no further disobedience of the court orders would
                    occur.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Therefore, I looked at whether the Varied
                    Unless Order was in fact breached and, if so, whether the facts of this case
                    justified the striking out of the Appellant’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the Varied Unless Order breached?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As set out earlier, the Varied Unless Order
                    issued by Lai J on 6 February 2012 was for the Appellant to fully comply
                    with the Specific Discovery Orders by 4pm on 20 February 2012 by providing
                    copies of all the documents in SLOD3 to the Respondents. Following the order,
                    the Appellant served SLOD4 and furnished copies of the documents listed therein
                    to the Respondents on 17 February 2012. Subsequently, the Appellant also sent a
                    letter explaining the SLOD4 documents on 23 February 2012 and replied to the
                    Respondents’ queries via a letter on 26 March 2012. The Appellant then
                    served SLOD5 on 27 March 2012 to further clarify its position, furnishing the
                    documents listed therein to the Respondents on 30 March 2012, within the
                    deadline set by SAR Ng on 29 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, despite this apparent flurry of
                    activities, not all the documents in the possession, custody or power of the
                    Appellant evidencing or relating to its gross profit, actual costs and net sales
                    (as described in the Specific Discovery Orders) were provided by the Appellant
                        <em>in accordance with the Varied Unless Order.</em>
                    The Appellant’s assertion that the Varied Unless Order was in fact
                    complied with was nothing more than a bare assertion. The mere <em>submission</em> of documents within the deadline was not
                    enough; in order to fully comply with the Varied Unless Order, the <em>substance</em> of the documents had to satisfactorily comply
                    with the Specific Discovery Orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Appellant asserted that this was the case
                    as it had:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... clearly and sufficiently explained and clarified in [its]
                        solicitors’ letters how [it] relied on the various documents [it] had
                        listed in SLOD 3, 4 and 5 to work out [its] profit margin as pleaded in
                        paragraph 18 of [its] Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 4) and that
                        these [were] the source documents [it had] relied on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the documents provided by the Appellant were
                    sufficient for full compliance with the Varied Unless Order. It is difficult to
                    see how this could be so when the Appellant had failed to address the specific
                    omissions and discrepancies described by the Respondents. Apart from sweeping
                    statements that it had “fully complied” with the Specific
                    Discovery Orders and “did not avoid replying” to the issues
                    raised, the Appellant failed to address the following objections raised by the
                    Respondents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     Regarding item A in SLOD4, the
                        e-mail correspondence provided by the Appellant only related to certain
                        types of spirit and the source documents for other products (<em>eg</em>, wine, champagne and sparkling wine) was not
                        provided.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
                        were discrepancies between the aggregated “costs” listed in
                        items 1 and 2 under the SLOD3 documents and item 65 of the SLOD4 documents
                        of $813,720.64 in 2007 and $1,101,415.41 in 2008. Source documents for the
                        actual costs of sales were incomplete, leaving the difference unaccounted
                        for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Regarding
                        items B and C in SLOD4, the source documents relating to the
                        Suppliers’ A&amp;P Rebates were incomplete, accounting for only
                        $181,933.92 in 2007 and $36,138.51 in 2008, and leaving $323,513.57 in 2007
                        and $178,384.37 in 2008 unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     Regarding item D in SLOD4, the documents
                        produced showing the Appellant’s purchase orders to suppliers failed
                        to cover all the different products provided by the Appellant to the
                        Respondents, as evidenced by the SLOD5 documents showing purchase orders in
                        respect of other products supplied not found in SLOD4. There was also a
                        shortfall of purchase orders accounting for the actual costs of goods
                        according to items 1 and 2 of the SLOD3 documents. In addition, some of the
                        purchase orders included under item D had missing pages. There were
                        also no source documents in relation to the handling fees (such as freight
                        forwarder’s bills), custom duties (on the products delivered to the
                        Respondents) and A&amp;P Funds paid by the Appellant. Source documents for
                        “other operating expenses” (referenced under item 66) were not
                        provided. The documents provided under items 66 to 68 (audited income
                        statements and general ledgers, which were also incomplete) were but
                        summaries prepared by the Appellant and not source
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_e"></a>(e)     Some of
                        the internal computer-generated accounts and records (<em>ie</em>, items 1 and 2 of SLOD3) included invoices which were
                        dated in the year 2006 (<em>eg</em>, “A/R
                        Invoice 29999” which had a posting date of 12 December 2006)
                        (“the 2006 invoice records”). The Appellant included the 2006
                        invoice records in items 1 and 2 of SLOD3, but failed to provide the source
                        documents for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_f"></a>(f)     Items 1 and 2 of the SLOD3 documents stated significantly lower
                        actual gross profit margins than the 49.64% estimated at para 18(4) of
                        the Appellant’s ASOC4. No source documents were provided for the
                        calculation of 49.64%.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_g"></a>(g)     Despite assurances given by the Appellant, it was unable
                        to produce the documents listed in item 5 of Schedule 2 of SLOD3
                        (source documents on which the Appellant’s internal computer generated
                        accounts and records were based). Even though these documents had reportedly
                        been seized by the Customs and Excise Department (“the CED”),
                        the Appellant had not made serious effort to recover the same despite having
                        had ample time to make the necessary requests to the CED since the Specific
                        Discovery Orders were made on 8 December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was telling that despite the above points
                    having been set out fully in Bernard Lim Miang’s 23rd affidavit dated 9
                    April 2012, the Appellant failed to address them in its subsequent reply
                    affidavit. It chose instead to make the bare assertion that the Varied Unless
                    Order had been fully complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the face of it, by failing to produce
                    documents that it had been ordered to under the Specific Discovery Orders by 4pm
                    on 20 February 2012, the Appellant had breached the Varied Unless
                Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Nevertheless, beyond the fact of the breach,
                    it was necessary to consider whether a striking out was warranted. As Phang J
                    noted in <em>Wellmix Organics</em>, unless orders are
                    “draconian in nature and effect” and will be enforced only if the
                    “party breaches the order both intentionally and contumeliously or
                    contumaciously” (at [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the striking out justified?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It appeared that the level of specificity of
                    documents demanded by the Respondents was not complied with because the
                    Appellant insisted that the documents supplied were sufficient for the purposes
                    of the Respondents’ calculation of the actual gross profit, actual net
                    sales and actual costs of goods. The Appellant felt that it had already:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... clearly and sufficiently explained and clarified in [its]
                        solicitors’ letters how [it] relied on the various documents [it] had
                        listed in SLOD 3, 4 and 5 to work out [its] profit margin as pleaded in
                        paragraph 18 of [its] Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 4) and that
                        these [were] the source documents [it had] relied on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As observed by AR Chua, the Appellant did not
                    argue that it did not have the disputed documents in its possession, custody and
                    power, apart from the documents seized by the CED. In fact, while making an oral
                    application for an extension of time before AR Chua in SUM 1819/2012, the
                    Appellant’s counsel appeared to concede (or at least it may be inferred)
                    that the Appellant <em>did have</em> the documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My client takes the view that he has complied with, but if Your Honour
                        takes the view that discovery requires disclosure of <em>all</em> the documents, including purchase orders, invoices, tax
                        receipts, etc. then we will have to apply for an extension of time.
                            <b><em>My client is willing to provide documents if this is
                            indeed required of them</em></b>. [emphasis in original in italics;
                        emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Instead, the Appellant chose to justify its
                    position by arguing that the documents yet to be produced were <em>unnecessary</em> for the calculations sought by the
                    Respondents. The Appellant argued that it had already complied by producing
                    indicative documents alongside various explanations and clarifications. The
                    Appellant’s position was clearly expressed in its counsel’s
                    submissions before AR Chua in SUM 1819/2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are saying that certain documents are <em>indicative</em> – not that we do not want to give. What we
                        have done is to go through all the things, given it to the auditors, they
                        cross check with the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What we are telling the Defendants is that <em>look at all
                            our lists, we have relied on these documents and how we are relying on
                            them</em>. That is the way my client has approached it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I am not saying that my clients have given
                            everything</em> to the Defendant but my client’s point is
                        that for example, purchase orders, we took <em>indicative</em> orders to show that the pricing is the same.
                            <em>That is how we have approached it</em>. If Your
                        Honour is of the view that that is not the order that has been given, then
                        if that is the approach, if you look at principles of law should our conduct
                        amount to contumelious conduct?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my view, the reason given by the Appellant
                    was simply unacceptable; whether the documents supplied were sufficient for the
                    purposes of verifying the figure of 49.64% was not a matter for the
                    Appellant’s unilateral decision. The Appellant could not assert that
                    “indicative” documents should be sufficient for the discovery
                    purposes just because those were the documents which the Appellant chose to rely
                    on in its own calculations. Its duty to produce all the documents as required by
                    the Varied Unless Order still remained and that duty had not been
                    discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Additionally, the Appellant argued that it had
                    never affirmed that it could give specific discovery of all the source documents
                    and so was not obliged to produce them. Again, this is not a good reason for
                    non-compliance. In <em>Soh Lup Chee v Seow Boon Cheng</em>
                    [2002] 1 SLR(R) 604, Choo Han Teck JC stated that where the court was satisfied
                    that certain documents had to exist, the party had either to produce them or
                    explain on oath what has become of them so that the contest at trial would be
                    open and fair. In that case, the dispute was whether the source documents from
                    which the “Balance Budget Summaries” (documents recording the
                    details or particulars in instances where there was a budget overrun) were based
                    on ought to be produced. In holding that there were numerous obvious omissions
                    of documents which must have existed and in the absence of good reason, Choo JC
                    found that the appellant had made out a sufficient case to strike out the
                    defence. However, while Choo JC eventually stopped short of striking out
                    the defence, the principle that <em>omitted documents proven to
                        exist must be accounted for</em> still remains. Source documents which
                    have been shown to exist must be produced; this is regardless of whether the
                    party had agreed or affirmed that such specific discovery could be given. Thus,
                    the Appellant’s mere assertion that it never agreed to disclose did not
                    negate the existence of this duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellant’s argument that the
                    Respondents’ queries about the discrepancies in some of the figures given
                    were unnecessary as the action had already been bifurcated was also correctly
                    rejected by AR Chua. On 16 January 2012, the appeal against the bifurcation
                    order (made by the learned assistant registrar Ong Luan Tze on 28 November 2011)
                    was dismissed by Woo Bih Li J in Registrar’s Appeal No 392 of 2011.
                    Hence, when the parties appeared before Lai J in RA 32/2012 two weeks later on 2
                    February 2012, the Appellant could have raised its contention that the queries
                    were no longer necessary <em>then</em>, instead of raising
                    it so much later. In the absence of an application to vary the Varied Unless
                    Order, it had to be fully complied with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This point on bifurcation was addressed in
                        <em>Federal Lands Commissioner v Neo Hong Huat</em>
                    [1998] SGHC 131, where Chan Seng Onn JC stated at [37]–[39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    I will now deal with the submission raised by
                            counsel for the defendant that the documents in question have nothing to
                            do with the issue of liability ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    
              <em>The learned Judicial
                                Commissioner had made the orders. They have to be strictly complied
                                with.</em> If the defendant felt that those discovery orders
                            should not have included documents that pertain only to the assessment
                            of damages and which were therefore irrelevant to the proceedings at
                            that juncture, then <em>he could have
                            appealed</em>. As far as I am concerned, that is not a relevant
                            issue before me. <em>I am only dealing with the question
                                of compliance with the orders of the court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    In any event, I think that those documents ordered
                            to be produced would be relevant to the question of damages and
                            therefore, they are going to be relevant at the trial where the
                            plaintiffs will have to prove damages. The plaintiffs have a right to be
                            given a full and fair discovery of such documents, though they may
                            relate entirely to the issue of the quantum of damages, which no doubt
                            would be disputed at the trial ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Hence, it was clear that taking the position
                    that the action had been bifurcated and that certain documents were not
                    necessary because they related to damages would not prevent enforcement of an
                    unless order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Appellant’s argument that its breach
                    was merely a technical one and thus should not warrant the enforcement of an
                    unless order was also not valid. In support of that proposition, the Appellant
                    cited <em>Wellmix Organics</em> where Phang J declined to
                    strike out the defence as he found the defendant’s breach of an unless
                    order to be a technical one arising from a misunderstanding. However, a perusal
                    of the facts in that case clearly show how the same could not be said of the
                    case before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>Wellmix
                        Organics</em> the defendant breached the unless order by failing to
                        <em>serve</em> the requisite affidavits of
                    evidence-in-chief (“the AEICs”) to the plaintiff within the
                    deadline of the unless order (<em>viz</em>, 21 June 2005)
                    even though it had already <em>filed</em> the AEICs by 21
                    June 2005. This was due to the defendant’s understanding that the parties
                    had agreed to an “exchange” of AEICs on 21 June 2005, which later
                    turned out to be incorrect. The defendant thereafter served its AEICs on the
                    plaintiff at the first opportunity it had after realising that the plaintiff had
                    no intention of exchanging AEICs the next day, <em>ie</em>,
                    22 June 2005. Under those circumstances, Phang J found that the
                    misunderstanding had caused the defendant to commit a mere
                    “technical” breach of the unless order. After all, the AEICs had
                    already been filed and could easily have been served on the Plaintiff within the
                    21 June 2005 deadline. Thus, the defendant’s actions were neither
                    contumelious nor contumacious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The facts of the case before me were vastly
                    different. The Appellant’s breach could not by any measure be considered
                    “technical”, and neither was it due to any misunderstanding
                    between the parties. Rather, over the long-drawn proceedings from the time the
                    Specific Discovery Orders were given on 8 December 2010 to the deadline of
                    20 February 2012 stipulated in the Varied Unless Order, the Appellant’s
                    efforts came across as tardy and half-hearted. Gaps in the documents were not
                    rectified, discrepancies in figures were not addressed and source documents were
                    simply not produced despite repeated prodding. Instead, the Appellant insisted
                    on pointing to the documents already produced as being in full compliance. Thus
                    at para 59 of its submissions the Appellant asserted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... GF’s Affidavit had clearly replied to the Defendants’
                        contentions, in pointing out and in setting out on exhibits the various
                        crucial Correspondence between the solicitors that followed after the Varied
                        Unless Order was made, wherein the <em>Plaintiffs had
                            explained in detail how they had relied on these documents set out in
                            their SLOD 3, 4 and 5 to compute their profit margin and the manner and
                            extent to which these documents had complied with the Specific Discovery
                            Order </em><em><u>in full</u></em>, as set out
                        below. [emphasis in original underlined; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Appellant’s excuse for failing to
                    comply with the Specific Discovery Orders within the time limit was that the
                    parties had been engaged in protracted and delayed negotiations in a bid to
                    settle, exacerbated by the hectic travel schedules of Bernard Lim Miang and
                    Giorgio Ferrari. As a result, the Appellant failed to reply to the
                    Respondents’ solicitors’ reminders to provide the documents listed
                    in SLOD3 as it had been preoccupied with the negotiations. It was disputed how
                    long those negotiations took before breaking down. In any case, the Appellant
                    only stated this reason in relation to the Specific Discovery Orders and not the
                    First Unless Order or the Varied Unless Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, this case <em>primarily</em> concerns the breach of the Varied Unless Order, and
                    not the Specific Discovery Orders (even though the requirements of Specific
                    Discovery Orders were substantially reflected in the Varied Unless Order).
                    Hence, the period during which the Appellant’s conduct would be the
                        <em>most</em> relevant was the time when the First
                    Unless Order was made until the deadline of the Varied Unless Order, <em>ie</em>, 12 January 2012 to 4pm on 20 February 2012
                    (“the material period”). While the distractions caused by the
                    protracted negotiations still arguably formed part of “all the
                    circumstances of the case” (<em>Syed Mohamed</em>
                    (at [15]), it would not be given as much weight as the circumstances surrounding
                    the Appellant’s failure to comply with the Varied Unless Order itself.
                    After all, the negotiations would not have had any impact on the
                    Appellant’s ability to comply with the First Unless Order and the Varied
                    Unless Orderas these orders were made only <em>after</em>
                    the negotiations had fallen through.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for the Appellant’s conduct during
                    the material period, the Appellant did not give any reason for non-compliance,
                    but firmly persisted in its assertion that the documents given were sufficient
                    for the purposes of complying with the Specific Discovery Orders. As discussed
                    above at para 27, such a bare assertion simply cannot mask the fact that the
                    documents and letters of clarifications submitted by the Appellant patently did
                    not fully comply with the Varied Unless Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Accordingly, as the Appellant failed to give
                    any good reason for its failure to comply or show extenuating circumstances
                    demonstrating that it did not intentionally ignore or flout the Varied Unless
                    Order, I was not persuaded that AR Chua’s decision to strike out its claim
                    was wrong. Being of the view myself that the Appellant’s conduct was in
                    fact contumelious, the striking out of the Appellant’s claim was
                    warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the event, the appeal was dismissed, with
                    costs fixed at $600 for Summons No 3685 of 2012 and $5,000 for Registrar’s
                    Appeal No 219 of 2012 inclusive of disbursements.</p>
