</div> one Gary Oon (“Oon”), a member of the Club, notified the Club of Sim’s conviction for insider trading and alleged that the offence involved an element of “moral turpitude” under rule 15(d)(i) of the Club Rules. Acting on this complaint, the then management committee of the Club (“MC 2012/2013”) called on Sim to explain why his insider trading conviction did not warrant a suspension of his membership with the Club under rule 15(d)(i). Sim’s response was that the offence of insider trading, being a strict liability offence, did not involve moral turpitude, and further that the offence had been committed by him inadvertently without any intention to make an unlawful gain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 MC 2012/2013 initially had a full complement of 11 elected and two co-opted members as permitted by the Club Rules. However, when it convened a meeting on 26 December 2012 to consider the complaint against Sim, two of the elected members had already resigned. Hence, only the remaining nine elected and two co-opted members attended that meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Between 26 December 2012 and 27 March 2013, another three elected members of MC 2012/2013 resigned, leaving six elected members and two co-opted members on MC 2012/2013. Prior to the 27 March 2013 meeting, MC 2012/2013 obtained from the Club’s solicitors a legal opinion stating that the offence of insider trading involved an element of moral turpitude. On 27 March 2013, seven (five elected and two co-opted) of the remaining nine members met to discuss the matter. The president of MC 2012/2013, Chua Hoe Sing (“Chua”), invited the members present to consider Oon’s complaint and Sim’s defence, and also the legal opinion of the Club’s solicitors, in preparation for the hearing scheduled for 3 April 2013.

After hearing Sim’s representations, MC1 unanimously decided that Sim’s conviction for insider trader involved moral turpitude, and therefore, fell within rule 15(d)(i) of the Club Rules. MC1 ordered that Sim’s membership and that of his wife be suspended as their memberships came under the category of “family membership” under the Club Rules which required the wife’s membership be suspended automatically upon the suspension of the husband’s membership.

The facts involving Sim’s conviction for insider trading had already been ascertained and the only questions were: (1) whether the conviction carried an element of moral turpitude; and (2) whether, in the opinion of MC2, Sim’s continued membership of the Club would place the Club in disrepute or embarrass it. In his view, these were inferences to be drawn from known or decided facts rather than findings of disputed facts <span class="font-italic">per se. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Judge also observed that when the management committee made a positive determination of these two required elements under rule 15(d)(i), it had no discretion but to suspend the membership of the offending member under rule 15(d)(i) and to grant a grace period of six months for that member to transfer the membership to some other person.  The Judge held that the six months’ grace period to sell the membership would not “result in a severe reduction in the economic value of the membership” (Judgment at [47]). At the most, Sim would suffer a loss of the social value that came with the membership of the Club. Therefore, while the rules of natural justice were applicable to a determination made under Rule 15(d)(i), they were not to be applied with the same rigour as they were in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> and <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Based on these general principles, the Judge proceeded to consider the issues listed above (at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues (1) and (2) – Whether the six members of MC2 were disqualified from hearing the complaint against Sim, and whether the principle of necessity applied in the circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Judge considered first the principle of necessity. He referred to the statement of the law (cited in <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong </span>at [42]–[43]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 The principle of necessity in administrative law is described in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury's Laws of Singapore</span> vol 1 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2012) at para 10.056:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person subject to disqualification at common law may be required to decide the matter if there is no competent alternative forum to hear the matter or if a quorum cannot be formed without him. Thus, if all members of the only tribunal competent to determine a matter are subject to disqualification, they may be authorised and obliged to hear and determine the matter by virtue of necessity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 The rule of necessity was considered in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj v Tang I Fang</span> [1981-1982] SLR(R) 391. It was unsuccessfully invoked because the relevant legislation provided for an alternative individual to act in the place of the disqualified arbiter. A P Rajah J had, in that case, impliedly accepted that the rule applied in Singapore. However, that case seems to indicate that the rule of necessity is more applicable to public bodies rather than private disciplinary tribunals. In [<span class="font-italic">Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</span> [1990] 170 CLR 70], Mason CJ and Brennan J described the underlying rationale of the rule of necessity at 89 as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... The rule of necessity gives expression to the principle that the rules of natural justice cannot be invoked to frustrate the intended operation of a statute which sets up a tribunal and requires it to perform the statutory functions entrusted to it. Or, to put the matter another way, the statutory requirement that the tribunal perform the functions assigned to it must prevail over and displace the application of the rules of natural justice. Those rules may be excluded by statute. …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Judge noted that the principle of necessity was held to be inapplicable in <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong</span> for various fact-specific reasons (Judgment at [50]); see also [83] below). He also noted that in <span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong v </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Democratic Party</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 774 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong</span>”), Warren L H Khoo J applied the principle of necessity to enable the central executive committee (“CEC”) of the Singapore Democratic Party (“SDP”) to sit as a disciplinary committee despite the plaintiff’s allegations of bias against nine members of the CEC. <span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong</span> is further discussed below (at [76]–[80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Following the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Lawrence Kong, </span>the Judge held that the principle of necessity was applicable to social bodies such as the Club, and that the principle was not restricted to tribunals exercising statutory functions (although the threshold to invoke it was high). In the Judgment (at [53]–[56]), the Judge held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 I find that [MC2] may avail itself of the principle of necessity in the circumstances of the present case. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong</span>, co-opting members onto the MC is not a viable alternative because the co-opted members do not have the power to vote at MC meetings under rule 21(a)(vii). More importantly, the power of [MC2] under Rule 15(d) is non-delegable. Rule 15(d) expressly refers to “the opinion of the Management Committee”. … Therefore, unlike the situation in <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong</span>, [MC2] here could not delegate its power under Rule 15(d) to any other committee.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 Finally, I am also of the view that [MC2] had done everything in its power to reduce, as much as was practicably possible, any bias including any suspicion or apprehension of bias when it decided on the [elected] members to make up [MC2] to hear and decide the matter. [MC 2013/2014] specifically decided at the 12 September Meeting to exclude members who were part of the [3/4/2013] Decision and to exclude the complainant, Gary Oon. The six members that were left were necessary to form a valid quorum. Although they had written the [25/7/2013] Letters, these six members were the least susceptible to allegations of bias, real or apparent. The MC had thus gone down the route which can be said to be the least of all evils in the circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 If all these six remaining [elected] members were also required to disqualify themselves, there will be no available MC with the necessary quorum to deal with the matter. This will frustrate the Club’s ability under the Club Rules (which all the members have agreed to at the point of joining the Club) to ensure that its members do not cause embarrassment or bring disrepute to the Club in any way, and should they do so by reason of having been convicted of an offence in a court of law involving dishonesty or moral turpitude, to remove them as members under the Club Rules in order to safeguard and preserve the reputation of the Club. For the purpose of constituting the MC to enable it to deal with such an important matter concerning the reputation of the Club, the doctrine of necessity must prevail over and displace the rules of natural justice to the extent necessary for this purpose to be achieved (see <span class="font-italic">Laws</span> v <span class="font-italic">Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</span> [1990] 170 CLR 70 at 96). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 Taking [Sim’s and his wife’s] case at its highest and assuming that the only fact that was before me was the presence of the [25/7/2013] Letters which expressed the individual views of the [6 elected members of MC2] in regard to the correctness of the [3/4/2013] Decision, I am prepared to accept that there could be some form of apparent bias. It must be stressed that this is solely on the basis of the [25/7/2013] Letters while disregarding all other facts from the 12 September Meeting (where the constitution of the [8 October 2013 hearing] was decided) leading up to the [8/10/2013] Decision. Even on this basis, I hold that the principle of necessity as an exception to the disqualifying effect of the rule against apparent bias applies. Not to allow the operation of the principle of necessity would be detrimental to the interest of the Club in safeguarding its reputation in accordance with the Club Rules. Accordingly, the members of the MC did not have to disqualify themselves in the particular circumstances of this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (3) – Whether the 8/10/2013 Decision was made without </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold">s</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and in breach of the rules of natural justice</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 With respect to this issue, the Judge found as follows (Judgment at [58]–[59]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sim merely asserted (on the basis of the 25/7/2013 Letters) that there was prejudgment on the part of MC2 “without clearly detailing any specific facts” on how: (a) the 8/10/2013 Decision was not made <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and had involved prejudgment; or (b) MC2 had been overly dictated by their prior views as articulated in the 25/7/2013 Letters more than two months before the 8/10/2013 Decision, such that MC2 had not considered afresh or with an open mind, all the relevant materials and submissions presented by Sim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) MC2, on the other hand, alluded to the following facts to show that MC2 had acted fairly and that apparent bias had not been made out on the totality of the facts:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Members who were or might be potentially in a position of conflict of interest were excluded.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The hearing was rescheduled to give Sim a full opportunity to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) MC2 heard Sim’s explanation for an hour and engaged him on the issues in question.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) MC2 took into account the new documents tendered by Sim.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) MC2 deliberated for half an hour before making its decision.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) MC2 did not consider itself bound by the 25/7/2013 Letters.

(Judgment at [71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 In sum, the test is whether a reasonable and fair minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion or apprehension that a fair trial is not possible. … It is an objective test from the perspective of a reasonable member of the public and not the court (<span class="font-italic">Shankar</span> at [82]).  …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Applying this test, the Judge held that (Judgment at [71]–[72]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 … Here, the relevant facts that the reasonable person would be apprised of would be all the circumstances of the case (see [59] and [70] above) including the correspondence between [Sim] and [MC2] and even the context in which the 25/7/2013 Letters were made. The further gloss added to this is that “the test of apparent bias relating to predetermination is an extremely difficult test to satisfy” (see emphasis above in [63]). This, in addition to the fact that the rules of natural justice are not to be applied in their full rigour in the present case, would make the hurdle of establishing apparent bias in the form of apparent predetermination not so easily jumped over.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 … I am prepared to accept that a reasonable suspicion or apprehension would be aroused in the mind of a reasonable and fair minded person reading the [25/7/2013] Letters and who was then later told of the fact that the [MC2] members who wrote those letters would be deciding the very matter that they gave their views on. There are good reasons for this suspicion or apprehension. Firstly, it is part of human nature that a person would be slow to change their prior views in the absence of anything new. The integrity of the decision maker would depend on consistency with prior decisions and for this purpose it is generally more difficult to change one’s view than to maintain it when the facts and circumstances have not changed. It may thus lead to a refusal to re-examine the matter afresh with an open mind. This, however, is not an immutable rule of human behaviour since accepting that one’s prior view was wrong is also seen as a virtue. Secondly, suspicion or apprehension would also be aroused since the [25/7/2013] Letters were given in support of a decision made by the former [MC1], of which some members are on the current [MC 2013/2014] and thus colleagues of those who made the [8/10/2013] Decision. This is not to say that there was in fact collusion, but the mere presence of the possibility would arouse suspicion or apprehension in the reasonable and fair minded person that [MC2] could be biased against [Sim]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 After expressing these reservations, the Judge nonetheless found (Judgment at [73]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 Having said that, I am of the view that there are other relevant facts that the reasonable and fair minded person would take into account. These are, firstly, the context in which the [25/7/2013] Letters were written. The [MC2] members did not initiate the writing of the [25/7/2013] Letters. They were approached by the former [MC1] to provide their views. Furthermore, these views were given even before the [3/4/2013] Decision was declared to be null and void. They were given without any inkling that they would have to decide the matter again. The allegation made here is in respect of the [8/10/2013] Decision. When the [25/7/2013] Letters were written, the [8/10/2013] Decision was not contemplated by any of the [MC2] members. The suspicion or apprehension of a potential predetermination or bias would be much stronger if the [MC 2] members had volunteered to give their views knowing they would have to sit and decide the matter again.

The second is disqualification by conduct, including published statements. That category consists of cases in which conduct, either in the course of, or outside, the proceedings, gives rise to such an apprehension of bias. The third category is disqualification by association. It will often overlap the first (e.g., a case where a dependent spouse or child has a direct pecuniary interest in the proceedings.) and consists of cases where the apprehension of prejudgment or other bias results from some direct or indirect relationship, experience or contact with a person or persons interested in, or otherwise involved in, the proceedings. The fourth is disqualification by extraneous information.

Predetermination consists in ‘the surrender by a decision-making body of its judgment’, for instance, by failing to apply his mind properly to the task at hand or by adopting an over-rigid policy. The decision is unlawful but not because it may appear biased (although in many cases it will). On the other hand, a decision-maker may apply his mind properly to the matter for decision and make a decision that is exemplary save that, because of some prior involvement or connection with the matter, the fair minded observer would apprehend bias.

The former is consistent with a preparedness to consider and weigh relevant factors in reaching the final decision; the latter involves a mind that is closed to the consideration and weighing of relevant factors.

There must, though, be few occasions when that can properly be done at a point prior to the leading of any evidence in the case since, at that stage, there is, by definition, no evidence before the court or tribunal on which it can comment. Moreover, if minded to make such a comment, it is plain that the risk of giving an impression of prejudgment will arise if it is not made clear to the parties that any views expressed are but provisional, that the tribunal's mind is not yet made up and that it remains open to persuasion.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the 25/7/2013 Letters were provisional judgments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Judge found as a fact that the opinion of the six MC2 members set out in the 25/7/2013 Letters did not constitute prejudgment on their part, and were no more than provisional views which might have led them to have a predisposition towards suspending the Appellants’ membership under rule 15(d)(i) of the Club Rules. In the Judge’s view, the 25/7/2013 Letters were not, in themselves, sufficient evidence that the six MC2 members had closed their minds to matter, as demonstrated by their various actions in giving Sim a full hearing and accommodating him on all his procedural needs and requests at the hearing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On the basis that the members of MC2 were not disqualified from hearing the complaint against Sim on the application of the principle of necessity, the Judge held (Judgment at [64]–[65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64 The time for determining whether there has been a breach of natural justice should be the conclusion of the entire hearing at the 8 October Meeting since all the factual circumstances leading up to the [8/10/2013] Decision and the decision-making process can then be examined.

It must be noted that I had accepted the possibility of apparent bias being made out on the basis that the only fact before me was the [25/7/2013 Letters] (see above at [56]). <span class="font-weight-bold">On that assumption, I found that necessity applied such that the MC members did not have to disqualify themselves</span>.

Hence, the members of MC2 who wrote the letters had not closed their minds to the issue and prejudged it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, he was prepared to accept that the 25/7/2013 Letters could evidence “some form of bias” and that the said letters might <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>show that the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">8/10/2013 Decision “was tainted with apparent bias or predetermination or both” </span>(Judgment at [56], [65] and [72]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, <span class="font-italic">on that assumption</span> (Judgment at [65]), MC2 was not disqualified from hearing the complaint against Sim, as otherwise there would have been no other body qualified to hear the complaint, and that such a result would be detrimental to the interest of the Club in maintaining its reputation (Judgment at [56]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, therefore, there was no alternative but to qualify MC2 to hear the complaint against Sim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifthly, the actual hearing showed that MC2 gave Sim a full hearing which was conducted fairly and impartially. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Judge adopted a “cover all bases” approach to deal with the issues raised in the case. In our view, while this approach might not necessarily be unfair to the appellants, it had the advantage of enabling the Judge’s findings at each stage of the process to reinforce the other, thus validating the process. For example, the finding that MC2 made the 8/10/2013 Decision with an open mind served to validate the initial finding that the 25/7/2013 Letters merely expressed the provisional views of its members. However, if the said letters amounted to apparent bias or prejudgment, which the Judge was only prepared to assume, but not find as a fact, the issues of whether the members of MC2 were disqualified from hearing the complaint and the applicability of the principle of necessity would become crucial. If the members of MC2 were disqualified for bias, and the principle of necessity was not applicable to private associations, or in the circumstances of the case, the final and fifth stage of the process would, and could, not have taken place. There would be no finding of fact at the final stage to reinforce the finding of fact at the first stage.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Were the views expressed in the 25 July 2013 Letters provisional?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Judge held that the six members of MC2 had not closed their minds as the 25/7/2013 Letters by themselves were insufficient evidence of the closing of their minds. He referred (Judgment at [75]) to the fact that, at the hearing itself, the “chairman Michael Ho specifically informed the first plaintiff that they had come to the hearing with an open mind and were giving him an opportunity to state his case…[and] that the [MC2] members had read all the documentation pertaining to the case.” He also referred to the fact that one member had disagreed with the majority’s decision. That, in sum, was the Judge’s reasoning for holding that MC2 heard the complaint against Sim with an open mind. The mutually reinforcing chain of reasoning is apparent from these findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We disagreed with the Judge’s approach and also his reasoning. Granted that the dissenting member’s vote might be interpreted as evidence of an open mind, it did not follow that the other five members had not closed their minds. Arguably, this argument cut both ways. It could be argued, for instance, and logically, that for <span class="font-italic">that reason </span>the other five members had closed their minds! It could be said that this was the exception that proved the rule. If the members of MC2 had been disqualified from hearing the complaint in the first place, there would be no factual finding that could provide an <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> justification for the initial finding that the conclusion expressed collectively in the 15/7/2013 Letters were provisional, subject to their giving a final conclusion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We could not agree with the Judge that the 25/7/2013 Letters were intended to express provisional views. Firstly, the writers were not asked to give their provisional views but their considered views on whether they agreed with the decision of MC1. Secondly, there was no occasion for them to give their concluded or final views on the matter. In our view, 25/7/2013 Letters were intended to inform the Judge that they, as incoming members of MC 2103/2014 shared the views of MC1 that Sim was not fit to remain a member of the Club. What the said letters meant to convey to the Judge was that <span class="font-italic">if they had been members of MC1, they would have made the same decision made by MC1 in order to protect the reputation of the Club</span>. We had no doubt that by the said letters, the members of MC2 had prejudged the complaint against Sim. The Judge accepted as a positive factor in favour of MC2 that its chairman had informed Sim that they had come to the hearing with an open mind and were giving him an opportunity to state his case. In our view, the Judge should have been more sceptical of assurances or declarations of this nature. In <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span>, the English Court of Appeal said at pp 477–478: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Nor will the reviewing court pay any attention to any statement by the judge concerning the impact on his mind or his decision: the insidious nature of bias makes such a statement of little value … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See also <span class="font-italic">Porter v Magill</span>, where Lord Hope said at [104] that a court should place no weight on statements by decision-makers that they are not biased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The members of MC2 were not selected because the chairman of MC 2013/2014 believed that they had emptied or intended to empty their minds of the views expressed in the 25/7/2013 Letters. They were selected because the other members were all disqualified from hearing the complaint, and the chairman thought that they were not so disqualified. In any case, whatever the state of their minds was, the 25/7/2013 Letters most certainly raised in the mind of a fair and well informed observer a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this connection, it is necessary to note that all the MC1 members who were involved in the 3/4/2012 Decision had disqualified themselves from rehearing the complaint against Sim as members of MC2 on the ground that they had already decided the complaint against Sim. But so did the six members of MC2. They were in exactly in the same position. In truth, it was arguable that their position was even worse. While those MC1 members had heard Sim in person before finding against him, MC2 had condemned Sim without hearing him. A considered decision is still a decision, even if expressed in a private or informal setting. Bias or prejudice expressed or shown in private is just as unacceptable as when shown in public. The character does not change. When the six MC2 members were selected to rehear the complaint against Sim, they should have asked themselves whether their own positions were any different from those of the members of MC1.

That rule operates to qualify the effect of what would otherwise be actual or ostensible disqualifying bias so as to enable the discharge of public functions in circumstances where, but for its operation, the discharge of those functions would be frustrated with consequent public or private detriment. There are, however, two <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> qualifications of the rule. First, the rule will not apply in circumstances where its application would involve positive and substantial injustice since it cannot be presumed that the policy of either the legislature or the law is that the rule of necessity should represent an instrument of such injustice. Second, when the rule does apply, it applies only to the extent that necessity justifies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 The question whether the application of the rule of necessity would involve positive and substantial injustice must be answered by reference to the circumstances of the particular case. In a case where the appearance or actuality of disqualifying bias is the result of conflict of interest or extrinsic knowledge, the relevant circumstances will include the manner in which the conflict of interest arose or the extrinsic knowledge was obtained (see, generally, Tracey, “Disqualified Adjudicators: The Doctrine of Necessity in Public Law”, Public Law, (1982), 628, at pp 634ff.). In particular, the circumstance that, in such a case, the conflict of interest or extrinsic knowledge arose from or was caused by the deliberate act of the party who would otherwise be entitled to complain of bias may dictate a negative answer to the question whether the application of the rule would involve positive and substantial injustice to that party. Conversely, the fact that such a conflict of interest or extrinsic knowledge arose from or was caused by some voluntary collateral act of the adjudicator may constitute a powerful consideration favouring an affirmative answer to that question. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island </span>[1998] 1 SCR 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Remuneration of Judges of PEI</span>”) (at [6]), the Supreme Court of Canada explained that the principle of necessity “finds its source in the rule of law” and serves to prevent a “failure of justice”. The court said (at [7]) that the principle “should be applied rarely, and with great circumspection” as it causes injustice. That case involved institutional bias, <span class="font-italic">as distinct from personal bias</span>, as the judges of various provincial courts had to decide on matters concerning the manner by and the extent to which provincial governments and legislatures could reduce the salaries of provincial court judges. Thus, no matter who the judges were, they would be in a position of conflict, as they would have had to decide an issue in which they had a pecuniary interest. This case can be compared with <span class="font-italic">Dimes v The Proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal and others </span>(1852) 3 HLC 758 (“<span class="font-italic">Dimes</span>”) where the Lord Chancellor had a conflict of interest as a result of personal circumstances, although in that case, the Lord Chancellor was only required to do a formal act, rather than to render a substantive decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In England (see <span class="font-italic">De Smith’s</span> at para 10-067), the position is that the doctrine has been sparingly employed, and if possible the decision-making body should remove that part of it which is infected. In Deane J’s words, “[i]t applies only to the extent necessity justifies” (<span class="font-italic">Laws</span> at [12]). The principle of necessity in effect requires one to choose, as between two evils, the lesser evil. Rather than suffer no justice being done at all by denying both parties from being heard, it permits a limited risk of injustice to one. Consequently, there must be, and there are, limitations to the applicability of the principle of necessity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The principle of necessity in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The High Court has held that the principle of necessity is applicable in the following cases: <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span>, <span class="font-italic">Chiam See </span><span class="font-italic">Tong</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Lawrence Khong, </span>and now, in the instant case.

Chiam was expelled for breach of party discipline for breaking his oath not to “do or say anything which may be detrimental to the<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>SDP<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>or undermine the standing of the leadership of the party within or without the party.” Chiam had criticised the conduct of certain leaders of the SDP at a talk given to the Singapore Press Club following his resignation. The CEC of the SDP decided to charge him for breaking his oath. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 He appeared before the CEC to answer the charges against him. He objected to five of the CEC members hearing the complaints against him on the ground of bias as they were the very persons he had criticised in public. He also objected to another four members who were employees of town councils whose chairmen were two of the CEC members he had criticised, and therefore would not be able to vote freely or independently. The chairman overruled his objections without giving any reasons. The CEC proceeded with the hearing, and, after hearing Chiam’s explanations, decided to expel Chiam from the SDP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Chiam contended in court that the disciplinary proceedings against him were conducted in breach of the rules of natural justice for the reason he had given to the CEC. He also alleged that the CEC failed to act in good faith in the best interest of the party and that the CEC’s actions were actuated by indirect and improper motives unconnected with his conduct, or that the CEC had acted maliciously in order to injure him. He also admitted that he would not have objected to the remaining four members of the CEC hearing the charges against him. Khoo J dealt with the issue of bias and necessity at [57]–[61] of his judgment as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 It seems to me that [Chiam] has formidable difficulties on this issue of bias. Defence counsel, in an able and well-researched submission, rightly reminds me that the relationship between [Chiam] and [SDP] was based on contract. [Chiam] was bound by the constitution. The constitution clearly designates the CEC as the body responsible for disciplining members of the party. There is no alternative tribunal. [Chiam], by being a member of the party, had agreed that the members of the CEC should act in an adjudicative capacity under cl IV(d) of the constitution.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 Theoretically, of course, it would have been possible for the nine members to whose participation [Chiam] objected to withdraw, leaving four members to adjudicate. It seems to me, however, that the constitution does not contemplate that disciplinary proceedings against a member should be conducted by such an emaciated body. The CEC would not have the character of a CEC if a substantial majority of its members were left out of it. I venture to suggest that the reason for having in the constitution the CEC as the disciplinary tribunal is to have a body whose members could bring their individual views and judgment to bear on a disciplinary matter. A hearing by the remnants of the CEC cannot possibly equate in quality a hearing by the whole CEC. This does not mean that individual members cannot be disqualified. However, where it is alleged, as in this case, that the overwhelming majority, including all the office bearers, should disqualify themselves, a serious question arises whether what is left is the kind of body which the constitution contemplates should be the body to take charge of such matters.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 [Chiam] at the Press Club interview had indeed criticised the whole of the leadership. By his own logic, the whole CEC should not have sat. Indeed, this was the stand he took when making his preliminary objections at the commencement of the hearing, although on a slightly different ground.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60 It seems to me that such a position was, and is, not a viable one in the context of this case. [Chiam’s] counsel and [Chiam] himself had difficulty suggesting what alternative tribunal would be available if the whole CEC were disqualified from sitting.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 In the absence of an alternative tribunal, it seems to me that out of necessity the CEC had to sit in judgment of [Chiam], as otherwise [SDP] would be powerless to act against the alleged infractions of discipline. I am much encouraged in taking this view by the following statement (citing authorities) in <span class="font-italic">De Smith’s Judicial Review of Administrative Action </span>(4th Ed, 1980) p 276:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification at common law may be required to sit if there is no other competent tribunal or if a quorum cannot be formed without him. Here the doctrine of necessity is applied to prevent a failure of justice. So, if proceedings were brought against all the superior judges, they would have to sit as judges in their own cause. Similarly, a judge may be obliged to hear a case in which he has a pecuniary interest. The judges of Saskatchewan were held to be required ex necessitate to pass upon the constitutionality of legislation rendering them liable to pay income tax on their salaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It seems clear to us, reading this judgment today, that since the five CEC members comprising the leadership of SDP (the other four impugned members were not leaders) were judges in their own cause, their participation in the proceedings against Chiam was in breach of a fundamental principle of the rules of natural justice. Applying the principle of necessity to enable them to participate in the matter would not have changed the inevitable outcome. It would result in a failure of justice that the principle is designed to prevent. Justice could not be done, and was not seen to be done. Hence, the principle of necessity could be a source of injustice in such situations. Applying it created a conundrum. How can the principle of necessity prevent a failure of justice without creating it in the very process of applying it to the case? Khoo J provided the solution by giving judgment to Chiam, on the factual finding that justice had not been done to Chiam as he had not been given a fair hearing. This outcome may be contrasted with the outcome in the present case, thus demonstrating the potential inconsistency and unsatisfactory consequence of applying the necessity principle to clubs and private associations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong</span>, there were two other possible solutions to the problem. Another judge hearing the case might have avoided the problem by interpreting the disciplinary rules as allowing only unbiased CEC members to hear the charges against Chiam (see <span class="font-italic">Laws</span> at [91] below). There was nothing in the constitution of the SDC that provided expressly that a disciplinary charge against a member must be heard by all the members of the CEC. A second solution, which would have been neater, would be for Khoo J to hold that, as a matter of law, the principle of necessity should be restricted only to bodies exercising statutory functions (which was the origin of the principle) and was not applicable to non-statutory, private committees. If there was no quorum because biased members of the CEC could not sit, it would be too bad for the SDP. The court should have allowed fairness to Chiam to prevail over the need for certain members of the CEC to be judges in their own cause. If the court had held that Chiam could not be charged and heard before a biased CEC, it would surely have prompted the SDP to constitute an impartial panel of the CEC to hear the complaints against Chiam without breaching the rules of natural justice, if the stakes were high enough for the good of the SDP as a political party. This could have been done, for example, by amending the constitution of the SDP to enable disciplinary issues to be resolved without breaching the rules of natural justice. As a matter of fact, when Chiam was crossed examined in court, he conceded that he would have been prepared to appear before the four CEC members against whom he had made no allegations of bias. The court discounted this on the ground that before the hearing before the CEC, Chiam had applied for the whole of the CEC to be disqualified. This showed that if the CEC had taken the trouble to question Chiam on this, a qualified CEC could have been constituted to hear the complaints against him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong, </span>the plaintiff (“Khong”) was a member of the defendant social club (“the SPC”) whose membership had been suspended for two months by a disciplinary tribunal comprising five committee members. The disciplinary tribunal found that Khong had acted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the SPC by disseminating a statement that questioned the propriety of the committee members’ decision to amend the results of a motion of no confidence against them. The disseminated statement had in effect criticised the conduct of all of the members of the disciplinary tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The SPC invoked the principle of necessity, and referred to two Malaysian decisions, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Fadzil bin Mohamed Noor v Universiti Teknologi Malaysia</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1981] 2 MLJ 196 and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Datuk T P Murugasu v Wong Hung Nung</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1988] 1 MLJ 291</span> for the proposition that disciplinary powers were vested solely in the disciplinary committees and that the principle of necessity applied to allow such individuals to still adjudicate over disciplinary matters despite a finding of apparent bias if nobody else could make up the disciplinary committee under the constitution. In this connection, the SPC argued that rule 23(a) of its Rules stipulated that any disciplinary hearing should be conducted by way of a committee meeting, and that rule 34(b) provided that “[f]ive Committee Members, three of whom shall be Charter Polo Playing Members, shall form a quorum”. It was the SPC’s case that only two 2013 Committee members who were not from the 2012 Committee could have participated in the disciplinary proceedings.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>Given its inability to form a quorum, it would then be impossible to hold a disciplinary committee meeting pursuant to rule 23(a). For this reason, it was argued that the rule against apparent bias should not operate to disqualify the 2013 Committee members who were needed to form a quorum. Otherwise, Khong could not be subject to disciplinary proceedings and this would be unjust to the SPC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Tan Siong Thye JC (as he then was) accepted the SPC’s argument that the principle of necessity applied to the SPC, but rejected the argument that it was applicable in the circumstances of the case. He gave the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the two “untainted” members were unaccountably absent from the committee meeting. The 2013 Committee could have rescheduled the disciplinary meeting to a date when the two “untainted” members could constitute part of the minimum quorum of five members to hear the complaint against Khong. Having a quorum of five members, with two of them “untainted” was better than having a quorum of five “tainted members” as justice must, as far as possible, be seen to be done—“so long as their presence would have enhanced the perception of justice being done, their presence was required” (<span class="font-italic">Lawrence Khong </span>at [47]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, under rule 31(1)(h), the 2013 Committee had the power to co-opt a maximum of two committee members to make up the quorum with the other two “untainted” members. This was not done or considered. This was an even better alternative as a majority of the five-member quorum would then have been neutral.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, rule 33 allowed the 2013 Committee to delegate its disciplinary powers to sub-committees in the Minute of Appointment or in the Byelaws. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does the principle of necessity apply to non-statutory bodies?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the three decisions discussed above, and also in the instant case, the courts were not asked and did not consider whether, as a matter of law, the principle of necessity was applicable to the private entities, as contrasted to public statutory bodies. In the instant case, the Judge was aware of this distinction between bodies exercising statutory and non-statutory functions. However, he held that there was no reason why the principle should be confined only to bodies exercising statutory functions (Judgment at [52]). He gave no reason for this finding, other than that the courts in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj</span> and <span class="font-italic">Chiam See Tong</span>, and also the two Malaysian cases had held that the principle of necessity was applicable to non-statutory bodies.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Save in India where the Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Amar Nath Chowdhury v Braithwaite and Company Ltd and others</span>, AIR 2002 SC 678 applied the principle to a private company in disciplinary proceedings against a shareholder (although the principle was found not applicable on the facts), we are not aware of any other commonwealth jurisdiction that has applied the principle of necessity to bodies exercising of non-statutory functions. In our view, this is so for good reasons. The purpose of the principle is to enable statutory tribunals and judicial bodies to hear matters in which they may have a personal or institutional interest, as not do so would frustrate the operation of the statutory provision with consequent public or private detriment and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Ebner v The Official Trustee in Bankruptcy </span>(2000) 205 CLR 337 at [65], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). As for administrative bodies, the principle of necessity preserves the public confidence in the performance of statutory functions. In this regard,  Mason CJ and Brennan J made the following observation in their joint speech in <span class="font-italic">Laws </span>(at [39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 … The rule of necessity gives expression to the principle that the rules of natural justice cannot be invoked to frustrate the intended operation of a statute which sets up a tribunal and requires it to perform the statutory functions entrusted to it.

In the case of statutory bodies, it would be to discharge functions vested in it by written law. In the case of private entities, the situation is entirely different. If the purpose is for, as is the case of private entities, the advancement or the protection of their private interests, then in a conflict between such interest and the interest of justice, the latter should prevail over the former. The principles of natural justice should not be subordinated to interests involving the private gain or loss in terms of reputation or social values of non-statutory, private bodies. There is no failure of justice to cure or any implication on the rule of law (which constitutes the source of the principle (see [69] above)), and consequently no reason to subject the defendant to prejudice, actual or potential. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The logic of not applying the principle of necessity to non-statutory bodies is sound. </span>To apply it in such circumstances would be to prefer an intolerable risk of failure of justice.

In contrast, statutory rules, if applicable, are intended to be applied even in situations where apparent bias may be present. The principle of necessity is born out of the necessity to give effect to the statutory scheme, and not to frustrate it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Statutory tribunals, and even the judiciary as an institution, can suffer from institutional bias (see <span class="font-italic">The Judges v Attorney-General for Saskatchewan </span>(1937) 53 TLR 464<span class="font-italic">; Beauregard v Canada </span>[1986] 2 SCR;<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Remuneration of Judges of PEI</span>), or the personal bias of the statutorily appointed adjudicator, but private associations do not suffer the same constraints. They can amend their constitutions or rules and can also use alternative means, such as to appoint other members, to remove the appearance of bias. As stated in <span class="font-italic">De Smith’s </span>(at para 10-067) in relation to statutory tribunals:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The doctrine of necessity has been sparingly employed, and if possible the decision-making body should remove that part of it which is infected with bias (for example, by the recusal of those members of a disciplinary committee who had been a part of a previous sub-committee which decided to institute proceedings against the claimant). Alternatively, where possible the body should be reconstituted (e.g. by constituting a separate panel). However, as we have seen, this is not always possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In contrast, reconstituting the panel in a private body is always feasible by changing the applicable rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In administrative cases, <span class="font-italic">Laws </span>involved a case where the conduct of members of a statutory tribunal was alleged to have given rise to a reasonable suspicion of prejudgment. The Australian High Court found that out of the ten tribunal members, only three were inflicted with bias. Consequently, it was held that only the other seven members were permitted to hear the matter, and that the other three members could not. In the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Jeff and others v New Zealand Dairy Production and Marketing Board and others </span>[1967] 1 AC 551 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeff</span>”), it was held that a marketing board was required to make a zoning order allotting milk produced by a district to a dairy company by way of necessity despite the fact that the board had given that very same dairy company a significant loan (and thereby having a pecuniary interest in its business). This was because the power to make zoning orders and the power to make loans were both statutory powers conferred upon the board by statute and in this regard, the Board observed (at 566):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When there is a conflict between the farmers and the factories, the board may find itself placed in an unenviable position, having, as the board accepts, the duty to act judicially and yet having a financial interest in maintaining and advancing the viability of the company to which it has advanced money. Yet in their Lordships’ view the conclusion is inescapable that Parliament intended in this instance to make an exception to the general rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The decisions in <span class="font-italic">Remuneration of Judges of PEI</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Jeff</span> make it clear the principle of necessity is only applicable to cases where it is legally impossible to have anyone other than the appointed authority as the adjudicator, and thus necessity applies. In any other case, that authority must do everything in its capacity to remove the bias (<span class="font-italic">Laws</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In our view, the strongest justification for holding that the principle of necessity is not applicable to private entities is that it is contrary to the rule of law if the principle would enable them to adopt disciplinary and other control rules that exempt them from having to observe the rules of natural justice. The principle of necessity would then become a source of injustice, rather than a bulwark against injustice. The law should not allow contractual rights to prevail over the principles of natural justice by resorting to the principle of necessity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">MC 2013/2014 failed to remove bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, the Judge held (Judgment at [54]–[55]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … [MC 2013/2014] had done everything in its power to reduce, as much as was practically possible, any bias including any suspicion or apprehension of bias when it decided on the [MC2] members to make up [MC2] to hear and decide the matter. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 … For the purpose of constituting [MC2] to enable it to deal with such an important matter concerning the reputation of the Club, the doctrine of necessity must prevail over and displace the rules of natural justice to the extent necessary for this purpose to be achieved (see <span class="font-italic">Laws</span> v <span class="font-italic">Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</span> (1990) 170 CLR 70 at 96)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 We could not agree with this finding. In our view, MC 2013/2014 failed to do everything that was practically possible to remove the bias associated with the 25/7/2013 Letters or to the extent necessary for this purpose to be achieved. There was one easy and simple thing that MC 2013/2014 could have done to achieve this purpose. If the members of MC 2013/2014 were so troubled by Sim’s continued membership of the Club tarnishing the reputation of the Club, all or a sufficient number of them could have sacrificed their management positions by resigning under rule 21(d)(ix)(2) of the Club Rules so that new untainted members could be co-opted or elected to fill the vacancies under rule 21(a)(iv). Such a gesture would have resulted in some delay in restarting the hearing of the complaint against Sim, but again, if the reputation of the Club was at stake, the delay would have been justifiable. As it is, the failure of MC 2013/2014 to do everything possible to remove “the infected part” had already resulted in several years of delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In our view, the Judge should have declined to invoke the principle of necessity in the circumstances of this case. He should have disqualified all the six members of MC2 on the ground of prejudgment amounting to actual bias or apparent bias. The decision-making process adopted by the Club was not, in our view, desirable and should have been avoided. The reason why courts disqualify a decision-maker from deciding a matter by reason of apparent bias is that notwithstanding his assurances that he has an open mind, no one can read his mind, and that bias is very often unconscious.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Given our findings at [95], we do not propose to examine all the reasons given by the Judge in upholding the 8/10/2013 Decision of MC2 (by a majority of 5 to 1) on the ground that much of the evidence placed before him showed the decision was not reached in breach of natural justice. However, it is desirable that we give our views on two matters on which we hold a different view:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first is the Judge’s finding that the rules of natural justice should not be applied with the same rigour as applied by this court in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin</span> because Sim had a grace period of six months to sell his “family membership” and that therefore it would not result in a severe reduction in the economic value of the membership (as a result of Sim being hamstrung to sell). With respect, we were unable to see the economic logic of this conclusion. There was no evidence to show what the market price of the Club’s membership was at the material time. Further, it seemed to us that Sim’s “family membership” was being put under a forced sale by the 8/10/2013 Decision. It is common knowledge that a forced sale of property reduces its value. Here, it was even worse than a forced sale. Under r 15(d) of the Club Rules, if Sim failed to transfer his family membership within six months, their membership rights would have been extinguished under the Club Rules.    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second is the exculpatory explanation that when the MC2 members wrote the 25/7/2013 Letters, they did not anticipate or expect that they would have had to decide the same issue. In our view, this explanation was not defensible. They must have been aware of the objective of the letters. Sim had argued that the 3/4/2013 Decision was made without a quorum, and the Judge had reserved judgment. A decision against the Club for lack of a quorum would have raised the prospect of their having to rehear the complaint against Sim. Indeed, we found it surprising that the said members agreed (or were advised) to write the letters when the issue of whether there was a quorum was <span class="font-italic">sub judice</span>, and that they ran the risk of committing contempt of court for attempting to influence his deliberations or interfere with the judicial process.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In summary, our decision was as follows:      </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 25/7/2013 Letters were evidence of actual prejudgment and the members of MC2 were disqualified from hearing the complaint against Sim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The principle of necessity is not applicable to social clubs and other private associations, like the Club.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even on the assumption that the principle of necessity was applicable to the Club, MC 2013/2014 had failed to do everything possible to make it possible for an impartial management committee of the Club to hear the complaint against Sim. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The constitutions or rules of private association, being contractual arrangements, may always be changed by the general body of members. Further alternate panels of adjudicators may be formed to ensure that biased members do not hear matters affecting the rights of a member. This is so that justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on the appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the reasons given, we allowed the appeal and declared the 8 October Decision null and void. We also awarded costs to the appellants fixed at $30,000 plus disbursements to be agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 After the conclusion of the appeal, the Parties filed written submissions on the appellant’s claim for damages. The appellants submit that, in addition to general damages, they are entitled to aggravated damages as this is a developing area of the law. They also submit that, in any event they are claim damages for mental distress suffered by them as a result of the wrongful suspension of their membership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Club submitted the appellants were not entitled to aggravated damages, but damages for mental distress could be awarded for breach of contract, but that the appellants have failed to adduce any evidence of mental distress to justify an award of damages for this head of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In our view, the appellants are not entitled to claim aggravated damages for breach of contract. Contractual damages are compensatory in nature. In <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club</span> [2008] SGHC 143 (“<span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin (AD)</span>”), which also involved the wrongful suspension of club membership, the Assistant Registrar provided an admirable analysis of the applicable principles of law in holding that Madam Kay was entitled to (a) damages for deprivation of her rights, and privileges as a member (including the loss of use of the facilities of the SICC); (b) damages for the humiliation, embarrassment, anguish and mental distress caused by the wrongful suspension; but not to (c) aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages. We endorse his analysis of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We accordingly hold that the appellants are entitled only to general damages, if any, relating the temporary loss of membership rights and privileges and mental distress, and direct that such damages be assessed by the Registrar or any Assistant Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon Andrew Phang Boon Leong  Chan Sek Keong<br/>Chief Justice  Judge of Appeal   Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ragbir Singh s/o Ram Singh Bajwa (Bajwa &amp; Co) for the appellants;<br/>Chang Man Phing, Ng Shu Ping and Lim Wan Yu Cheronne (WongPartnership LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
