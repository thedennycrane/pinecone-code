        Lai Siu Chiu J :</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim by Toh Ah Leng (“the
                    plaintiff”) against Four Sea Circuit Board Ltd (“the
                    defendant”) for commission arising from the plaintiff’s
                    introduction of customers to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a sole-proprietorship while the
                    defendant is a Hong Kong company that purchases printed circuit boards
                    (“PCBs”) from a circuit board manufacturer in China and on-sells
                    the same to its customers. The plaintiff was once a marketing manager of the
                    PCBs division of a Singapore company and acquired considerable experience in the
                    industry, both practical and technical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Some time in 1997 or 1998, the plaintiff was
                    introduced to the defendant’s marketing manager Chow Tai Lok Danniel
                    (“Danniel”) when the defendant participated in an exhibition in
                    Singapore that showcased its products to potential customers. The introduction
                    was with a view to the plaintiff’s then employer acting as the
                    defendant’s agent in Singapore but no contract materialised from the
                    negotiations between the plaintiff’s employer and the defendant in that
                    regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff left the employment of his then
                    employer in October 1999. Danniel had kept in touch with the plaintiff and was
                    contacted by the latter who inquired if the defendant was interested to expand
                    its customer base in Singapore. Danniel expressed his interest and flew to
                    Singapore to meet the plaintiff and to discuss what customers the plaintiff
                    would be able to acquire for the defendant. The plaintiff took Danniel to meet
                    prospective customers with whom the plaintiff already had a relationship and
                    from whom the plaintiff was confident he would be able to procure orders for the
                    defendant. These customers included Creative Technology Ltd
                    (“Creative”) and Panasonic Matsushita Graphic Communication
                    Systems (S) Pte Ltd (“Panasonic”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The discussions between Danniel and the
                    plaintiff culminated in an agreement dated 1 December 1999 (“the
                    First Agreement”) (drafted by the plaintiff) wherein the plaintiff was
                    appointed the defendant’s representative to source for customers in
                    Singapore and Malaysia for its PCBs. The defendant’s marketing director
                    Cheung Kong Tim signed the Agreement on the company’s
                behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The salient terms of the First Agreement
                    included the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the agreement was for one year (clause
                        1);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">commission would be payable to the plaintiff, by
                            bank transfer, within seven working days after the defendant’s
                            receipt of payment from its customers (clause 7);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">customers would make payment directly to the
                            defendant’s bank account in Singapore and upon written
                            confirmation by the defendant, the plaintiff’s commission would be
                            transferred to the plaintiff’s bank account in Singapore (clause
                            11);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the defendant’s accounts department was to
                            release to the plaintiff information on the defendant’s bank
                            account relating to payments and deposits (clause 12);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in the event of termination of the agreement, the
                            plaintiff was entitled to full commission on all subsequent orders
                            placed by customers who had previously been referred by the plaintiff
                            (clause 8);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the agreement was governed by Singapore law
                            (clause 13).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There were two versions of the First Agreement
                    presented before this court with the plaintiff arguing that he had not agreed to
                    the defendant’s version in which cl 12 (at (d) above) was deleted.
                    The defendant, on the other hand contended that cl 12 was deleted at the
                    defendant’s request with the plaintiff’s consent because of the
                    discomfort of the defendant’s managing director (“the MD”)
                    with the clause (which will be elaborated on later). I shall refer to the
                    defendant’s version of the Agreement as the “revised First
                    Agreement”. In any case, between 1 December 1999 and 13 April
                    2000, no purchase orders were placed with the defendant by customers procured by
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In or about early April 2000, the plaintiff
                    informed Danniel that he had made headway with Creative and Panasonic which
                    companies indicated to the plaintiff that they were willing to place orders for
                    PCBs with the defendant at their requested prices (“the indicative
                    prices”); the plaintiff forwarded the indicative prices to
                    Danniel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After due consideration of the offers made by
                    Creative and Panasonic, Danniel decided that it was viable for the defendant to
                    sell PCBs to both companies based on the indicative prices provided the
                    plaintiff was paid no more than 3% commission. The plaintiff was agreeable to
                    the defendant’s condition and the parties signed an addendum dated
                    13 April 2000 to the First Agreement, to record the terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 1 September 2001, the parties entered
                    into yet another agreement which was backdated to 1 March 2001 (“the
                    Supplemental Agreement”). The purpose of the Supplemental Agreement was
                    to regulate the payment of 1.5% commission to the plaintiff for purchase orders
                    from Creative and 2% commission for purchase orders from Panasonic as well as
                    from two other customers <em>viz</em> Epson and Hewlett
                    Packard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Pursuant to a telephone request from the
                    plaintiff to Danniel in July 2003, the defendant agreed to increase the
                    plaintiff’s commission for orders placed by Creative from 1.5% to 2% for
                    sales that exceeded US$70,000 each per month, even though there was no
                    contractual obligation on the part of the defendant to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Three Hong Kong companies in the Casio group
                    had been customers of the defendant well before the plaintiff’s
                    appointment as the defendant’s agent. Danniel managed the business from
                    Casio on the defendant’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In 2001, Casio’s Singapore entity, Casio
                    Singapore Pte Ltd (“Casio Singapore”), contacted Danniel with a
                    view to the defendant supplying Casio Singapore with PCBs. Although purchase
                    orders were placed by Casio Singapore, the components ordered were delivered to
                    Asahi Industries Malaysia Sdn Bhd (“Asahi”) for assembly on Casio
                    Singapore’s behalf. Subsequently in late 2001, Casio Singapore changed its
                    mode of operations and Asahi issued purchase orders directly to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In or about July 2002, Casio Singapore
                    replaced Asahi with Flextronics Manufacturing (HK) Ltd
                    (“Flextronics”) to carry out the assembly of Casio’s
                    products in South East Asia. Consequently, the defendant ceased receiving
                    purchase orders from Asahi and received orders from Flextronics
                instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Although the plaintiff was not entitled to
                    receive commission for orders placed by or on behalf of Casio Singapore (as it
                    was not his customer), the defendant was willing to pay the plaintiff commission
                    to oversee the business from Casio Singapore provided the percentage did not
                    exceed 1.5% of payments received from Casio Singapore. The plaintiff accepted
                    the defendant’s offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In or about November 2003, the plaintiff
                    contacted Danniel by telephone to inform Danniel that he no longer wished to
                    manage the account of Casio Singapore. The plaintiff felt that the commission he
                    received was not commensurate with the amount of effort he put in to oversee the
                    account as the orders placed were not large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Danniel was of the view that Casio Singapore
                    was an important customer even if its orders were not large. Accordingly, he
                    offered to increase the defendant’s commission to 5%. The plaintiff
                    accepted his offer and this was confirmed in Danniel’s email to the
                    plaintiff dated 28 November 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     After his email of 28 November 2003,
                    Danniel followed up by forwarding an agreement to the plaintiff for his
                    signature. The MD, however was uncomfortable with the 5% commission rate and
                    requested Danniel to renegotiate the same down to 3.5%. Danniel accordingly
                    contacted the plaintiff by telephone to convey the MD’s concerns. The
                    plaintiff agreed to reduce his commission for purchases by Casio Singapore from
                    5% to 3.5%. Danniel sent an email to the plaintiff on 2 December 2003 to
                    record the agreement reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In or about June 2004, the MD pointed out to
                    Danniel that orders for PCBs from Casio Singapore were being placed by
                    Flextronics with whom the defendant had a good on-going relationship. He did not
                    see the need for the plaintiff to maintain a relationship with Casio Singapore.
                    Danniel was therefore instructed to inform the plaintiff that he should cease
                    all contact with Casio Singapore. As Casio Singapore was never a customer
                    procured by the plaintiff, the latter agreed. The defendant ceased paying the
                    plaintiff commission from June 2004 onwards for payments received from Casio
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The payment of commission to the plaintiff
                    under the Supplemental Agreement included orders received from the
                    subcontractors of Panasonic such as SQ (HK) Ltd (“SQ”) and from
                    Panasonic’s Indonesian affiliate PT Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics
                    Industries Indonesia (“MKI”). MKI also instructed its
                    subcontractors Sheen World Trading Limited (“Sheen”) and Worldwide
                    Unix (S) Pte Ltd (Worldwide”) to order their PCBs from the defendant. The
                    defendant considered orders placed by SQ as emanating from Panasonic and paid
                    the plaintiff 2% commission thereon as provided under the Supplemental
                    Agreement. Between end 2003 and early August 2004, the defendant paid the
                    plaintiff commissions on all payments received from MKI at an agreed commission
                    rate of 3.5%. . Purchase orders placed by Sheen and Worldwide were considered as
                    purchase orders placed by MKI for the purposes of determining commissions
                    payable to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In or about early August 2004, the plaintiff
                    contacted Danniel to request an increase in his commission payment from MKI in
                    view of the termination of commission to him on payments received from Casio
                    Singapore. The defendant agreed to increase his commission from MKI orders to 5%
                    on all payments received by the defendant from 14 August 2004 to
                    31 December 2004. The defendant would pay the same rate of commission to
                    the plaintiff on payments not exceeding US$150,000 received from MKI with effect
                    from 1 January 2005. For payments from MKI that exceeded US$150,000, the
                    plaintiff’s commission rate would be 3.5%. As requested by the plaintiff,
                    Danniel sent him an email on 14 August 2004 to confirm the above
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In early December 2004, the defendant was
                    informed by MKI through the plaintiff that MKI had encountered problems with the
                    PCBs supplied by the defendant. Danniel was tasked by the defendant’s
                    management to resolve the problem. Daniel arranged to review the manufacturing
                    process at MKI after which a report dated 11 December 2004 on corrective
                    action was prepared. The defendant agreed thereunder to assume liability for any
                    losses incurred by MKI if indeed the losses resulted from the defendant having
                    supplied PCBs that were defective. The defendant and MKI jointly agreed to
                    appoint an expert from Hong Kong Polytechnic University to ascertain whether the
                    defendant had indeed supplied defective PCBs. Due to the high cost involved,
                    both sides ultimately abandoned the idea of an expert report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Subsequently, after discussions between the
                    defendant and MKI, the latter conceded that the PCBs supplied by the defendant
                    could not have been defective as they had passed MKI’s quality control
                    tests that were conducted at the time of receipt by MKI of the defendant’s
                    PCBs. Consequently, MKI did not pursue the issue of compensation from the
                    defendant nor did the defendant pay any compensation to MKI. MKI continued to
                    place orders for PCBs with the defendant through Sheen and
                Worldwide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant eventually terminated the
                    plaintiff’s services under the revised Agreement and the First and
                    Supplemental Agreement by a letter dated 18 July 2005 (“the Termination
                    Letter”). Danniel felt that the plaintiff was becoming increasingly
                    irrational and his behaviour was disrupting the defendant’s business and
                    its operations. The plaintiff had repeatedly alleged that the defendant had not
                    adhered to its contractual obligations and had even threatened to take legal
                    action against the defendant. On his part, the plaintiff refused to issue
                    invoices to the defendant to enable the defendant to pay commission that was due
                    to him. Prior to July 2005, Danniel had prepared the plaintiff’s invoices
                    on the plaintiff’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff took the position that
                    notwithstanding the Termination Letter, he continued to be entitled to be paid
                    his commission under cl 8 of the First Agreement so long as his customers
                    continued to place orders for PCBs with the defendant. On 17 June 2005, the
                    plaintiff through his solicitors demanded that the defendant account to him for
                    all the purchase orders that were placed by the defendant’s customers. In
                    a separate letter dated 12 June 2006, the plaintiff demanded that the
                    defendant open a bank account in Singapore to credit payments received from its
                    customers and that the defendant provide all relevant banking documents to
                    enable the plaintiff to verify the commission that was due to him. When his
                    demands were not acceded to, the plaintiff commenced this suit on 28 June
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In his statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that although he had received
                    some commission from the defendant, the latter did not render to him an account
                    of the purchase orders received from the plaintiff’s customers to enable
                    him to verify the commission that was due to him. The plaintiff added that in
                    supplying defective PCBs to MKI, the defendant had breached the express and/or
                    implied term under the First Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement that the
                    defendant would take reasonable steps to ensure that the PCBs supplied to the
                    plaintiff’s customers were of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose
                    for which they were ordered. As a result of the defendant’s breach, the
                    plaintiff alleged that MKI had significantly reduced its orders with the
                    defendant, thereby causing the plaintiff to suffer loss and damage by way of
                    reduced commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff prayed for the following
                    reliefs:-</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an account of all purchase orders received by the
                            defendant from the plaintiff’s customers;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">payment of all outstanding commission due and
                            owing to the plaintiff after an account in (a) above had been
                            taken;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an order that the defendant open an account with
                            a local bank and deliver monthly bank statements to the
                            plaintiff;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">damages arising from the defendant’s
                            alleged supply of defective goods to MKI.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant, not surprisingly, denied all
                    the plaintiff’s allegations of breach of the two agreements in question
                    and denied his claim, contending that the defendant had paid the plaintiff
                    whatever commission that was due to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (‘AEIC”), the plaintiff deposed to five heads of claim:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">outstanding commission;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">commission from sales to Casio;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">claim for the correct commission
                        rate;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">commission due from sales to Creative Technology
                            Qingdao Co Ltd (“Creative Qingdao”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">damages arising from the defendant’s
                            alleged failure to deliver products of merchantable quality to
                            MKI.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff was the only witness for his
                    case while the defendant’s witness was Danniel as well as Bob Yap Cheng
                    Ghee (“Yap”), an executive director of KPMG Advisory Services Pte
                    Ltd (“KPMG”), who prepared a report (and supplementary report) on
                    the actual commissions paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and compared the
                    figures with the plaintiff’s actual entitlement under the two
                    agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As the mode of payment of commission was
                    highly contentious between the parties, it would be appropriate to deal with the
                    issue at this juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Pursuant to discovery orders obtained by the
                    plaintiff, the defendant provided to the former copies of purchase orders,
                    invoices as well as credit advice statements of its customers. The
                    documentation, however, did not seem to satisfy the plaintiff who, in his AEIC,
                    contended that the documentation was self-serving in nature unless the defendant
                    also disclosed its bank statements. The plaintiff added that, contrary to the
                    defendant’s case he had not given up his entitlement to commission from
                    Casio Singapore in exchange for an increase in commission from
                    Panasonic/MKI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In his AEIC, the plaintiff further claimed
                    commission relating to orders for PCBs placed by an affiliate of Creative
                        <em>viz</em> Creative Technology Qingdao Co Ltd China
                    (“Creative Qingdao”). He disputed the defendant’s contention
                    that the orders were placed by Creative Qingdao with He Shan Four Sea Circuit
                    Board Ltd, the defendant’s affiliate company, and not with the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The allegation in <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> was neither pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of
                    claim nor reply. It had not been raised by the plaintiff before the commencement
                    of this suit nor referred to in any correspondence/emails exchanged between the
                    parties prior thereto. Yet, the plaintiff applied to court and was granted an
                    order on 23 August 2007, to administer Interrogatories to Creative to
                    answer the following questions:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">What is the relationship between Creative and
                            Creative Qingdao?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Did you and do you issue purchase orders for and
                            on behalf of Creative Qingdao to the defendant from the year 2001 to
                            current date?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Has Creative Qingdao ever issued purchase orders
                            in its own name to the defendant for domestic purchases?</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Creative had answered the three
                    Interrogatories as follows:-</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Creative Qingdao is a subsidiary of
                            Creative.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">No.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Creative cannot answer on behalf of Creative
                            Qingdao. However, to the best of its knowledge, information and belief,
                            Creative Qingdao has previously issued purchase orders in its name to
                            the defendant for domestic purchases.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Not satisfied with Creative’s Answer to
                    his third Interrogatory, the plaintiff again applied to court and obtained an
                    order on 13 November 2007 for Creative to file a Supplementary Answer. In
                    its Supplementary Answer filed on 27 November 2007, Creative (by its
                    vice-president of legal services) pointed out that it was being asked to answer
                    on behalf of Creative Qingdao which was a separate entity from Creative being
                    incorporated under the laws of China and which was not a party to the
                    plaintiff’s application for Interrogatories (for which the plaintiff
                    offered no explanation nor did the court inquire). Creative added that the third
                    Interrogatory was framed in such wide terms with no fixed time frame stipulated.
                    Creative therefore gave its answer relying on its own files, documents and
                    records as opposed to oral information from Creative Qingdao.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Still undaunted, the plaintiff applied to
                    court for the third time and obtained yet another order on 7 December 2007
                    for Creative to further answer Interrogatory (c) (see<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above) which
                    it did as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As directed by the Honourable Court, Creative has asked the senior manager
                        of procurement of Creative Qingdao the interrogatory namely “Has
                        Creative Technology (Qingdao) Co Ltd ever issued purchase orders in its own
                        name to the <em>Defendants</em> for domestic
                        purchases?”’ and Creative Qingdao’s answer, via
                        it’s senior management of procurement, is that it had previously
                        issued purchase order(s) in its own name to the Defendants for domestic
                        purchase. [emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the defendant’s application (made in
                    Summons No. 4126 of 2008), I expunged paras 92 to 105 (and exhibits TAL-9,
                    TAL-10 and TAL-15) of the plaintiff’s AEIC relating to his claim for
                    commission on Creative Qingdao orders placed with the defendant, before
                    commencement of this trial. The claim was never pleaded and should not have been
                    raised in the plaintiff’s AEIC notwithstanding that it was the subject of
                    Interrogatories granted by the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the course of his cross-examination, the
                    plaintiff raised for the first time his argument that the defendant was obliged
                    to provide him with copies of purchase orders under cl 3 of the
                    Supplemental Agreement. This is incorrect as can be seen from the wording of
                    cl 3 which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>FOUR SEA</b> shall submit to <b>Representative</b> [the plaintiff] monthly statements of
                        commissions due and payable to <b>Representative</b>
                        under the terms of this agreement, with reference to the specific Purchase
                        Order, invoices and customers name on which the commission are being
                        paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was the defendant’s case (which I accept) that on a plain
                    reading, cl 3 does not entitle the plaintiff to be furnished with copies of
                    the defendant’s purchase orders but only with monthly statements of
                    commission that were due to him, with reference to purchase orders, invoices and
                    customers, as a means of verification. After repeated cross-examination by
                    counsel for the defendant and after being pressed by the court, the plaintiff
                    eventually conceded<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> that his interpretation was
                    incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff had further relied on cl 4
                    of the Supplemental Agreement which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>FOUR SEA CIRCUIT BOARD LTD</b> must release
                        original bank payment records to verify the accuracy of commissions paid by
                            <b>FOUR SEA</b> under the terms of this
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Again, cl 4 does not entitle the plaintiff to receipt of the
                    defendant’s purchase orders or invoices but only to the defendant’s
                    bank payment records including credit advices to verify the accuracy of the
                    commissions that he received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant relied on the voluminous
                    documents they had produced<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> to support its defence that it
                    had disclosed all purchase orders and bank advices which it had received from
                    the plaintiff’s customers. The plaintiff produced no evidence to
                    contradict the defendant’s contention and documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Having dealt with cll 3 and 4 of the
                    Supplemental Agreement, I turn now to the parties’ dispute regarding
                    cl 12 of the First Agreement. That clause has to be read together with the
                    preceding cl 11. The clauses state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    The customer will make payment directly to FOUR SEA
                            controlled bank account located in Singapore and upon written
                            confirmation by FOUR SEA the remaining due payment will be automatically
                            transferred to the Representative account in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    With respect to the account into which customer
                            receipts are to be paid, Representative [the plaintiff] shall not have
                            any authorization to remove any funds from the account, but FOUR SEAL
                            CIRCUIT BOARD LTD Accounting Department must release customer payment
                            statement from bank account, concerning deposits and payments from such
                            account. The parties shall take all steps necessary to guarantee that
                            Representative shall promptly receive its commission on amounts paid
                            into such account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In his AEIC (paras 10-12), Danniel had
                    deposed that the MD had expressed concerns with cl 11 and more so with
                    cl 12 as that gave the plaintiff an unfettered authority to make inquiries
                    concerning deposits and payments from the bank account into which payments from
                    customers would be made. As a result, Danniel subsequently brought to Singapore
                    a reformatted and identically worded draft agreement containing the same terms
                    as those in the First Agreement for discussion with the plaintiff. Danniel
                    deposed that the plaintiff agreed to cross out cl 12 after some discussion.
                    Danniel and the plaintiff then executed the revised First Agreement which, as it
                    was intended to supersede the First Agreement, was similarly dated
                    1 December 1999. Danniel explained that cll 3 and 4 were inserted into the
                    Supplemental Agreement because the parties had dispensed with cl 12 in the
                    First Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In his AEIC, Danniel deposed that payments
                    from the plaintiff’s customers were made to the defendant in Hong Kong and
                    the defendant then paid the plaintiff by telegraphic transfer. Upon receipt of
                    payments from customers in respect of which commission was due to the plaintiff,
                    Danniel would forward bank records in respect of such payments to the plaintiff
                    for his information. Such bank records consisted of copies of cheques from
                    customers or credit advices issued by the defendant’s bank, Nanyang
                    Commercial Bank Ltd. Danniel would prepare an invoice on behalf of the plaintiff
                    who, for reasons unknown to the defendant, refused to issue any invoice to the
                    defendant for his commission. Danniel at the plaintiff’s request, agreed
                    to help the plaintiff to issue invoices in lieu of monthly statements of
                    commissions to be furnished pursuant to cl 3 of the Supplemental Agreement.
                    Danniel would email the invoice he had prepared on the latter’s behalf to
                    the plaintiff for comments before payment to the plaintiff was
                processed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Danniel asserted the parties arrived at and
                    practised this standing agreement until July 2005 when he decided he would no
                    longer prepare the plaintiff’s invoices for the plaintiff in view of the
                    plaintiff’s unreasonable attitude. When he requested the plaintiff to
                    prepare his own invoices thenceforth, the plaintiff refused and demanded that
                    the defendant pay his commission without any invoices from the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the light of the plaintiff’s
                    uncooperative attitude, Danniel started preparing monthly commission lists that
                    supported the commission sums paid to the plaintiff. He would forward the lists
                    to the plaintiff and request for invoices which the plaintiff eventually did
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The defendant pointed out that prior to the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of demand dated 17 June 2005,
                    the plaintiff had never once raised objections to the defendant’s omission
                    to open a bank account in Singapore. In cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, the
                    plaintiff sought to explain his silence over four years by claiming that he had
                    sent repeated reminders (referring to incorrect documents) and by asserting he
                    had spoken to random persons in the defendant’s organisation (which was
                    not substantiated), on the opening of a bank account by the defendant in
                    Singapore. The defendant contended that by his conduct, the plaintiff had waived
                    the requirement of the opening of a bank account under cl 12. The defendant
                    argued that in any case, the plaintiff had suffered no loss by its failure to
                    open a bank account in Singapore. Whether a bank account was or was not opened
                    in Singapore by the defendant had no bearing whatsoever on the commission that
                    the plaintiff earned from the defendant. This was conceded as much by the
                    plaintiff during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It was patently clear from his answers during
                    cross-examination that apart from his own belief, the plaintiff did not have any
                    inkling of what his case against the defendant for commission was premised on.
                    It is also telling that the plaintiff admitted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> that even with all the
                    voluminous documents that the defendant had provided to him in discovery, he
                    would still not be able to calculate the commission payable to him. To adopt the
                    defendant’s closing submission, the plaintiff was merely taking a shot in
                    the dark against the defendant in the desperate hope of procuring some
                    commercial settlement. The plaintiff constantly shifted his stance and his
                    repeated prevarications rendered his evidence unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I arrived at my poor impression of the
                    plaintiff after noting the highly unsatisfactory answers given by him both in
                    cross-examination and to questions posed by the court. To elaborate, the
                    plaintiff was unable to furnish even a ballpark figure of what he was claiming
                    in unpaid commission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> despite repeated questioning. It was only
                    after the court explained that his filing his suit in the High Court meant that
                    his claim must exceed $250,000 that he ventured a guess of $250,000 to $300,000
                    over and above the US$141,523.48 the defendant had paid him, but without
                    providing any evidence. He further alleged that US$130,000 to US$150,000 of that
                    ballpark figure related to commission due from sales to Creative while the
                    balance was for sales to Creative Qingdao, which evidence I had already expunged
                    from his AEIC as it was not part of his pleaded claim. Consequently, the
                    plaintiff’s claim relating to Creative Qingdao was disregarded along with
                    his closing submissions (paras 74 to 79) in that regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As was rightly pointed out in the
                    defendant’s closing submissions (citing s 103 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)) the burden was on the plaintiff to prove his
                    case – that the defendant still owed him commission over and above the
                    US$141,523.48 he had already received; it was not for the defendant to prove or
                    disprove his case. Apart from his bare assertions, the plaintiff
                        agreed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    that he had no supporting documents or any other evidence to substantiate his
                    case that the defendant still owed him commission for the period July 2001 to
                    June 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I turn next to the issue of the actual
                    commission that the defendant had paid to the plaintiff to determine whether the
                    plaintiff was short paid as he alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Although his statement of claim stated that he
                    was entitled to a commission rate of 1.5% for sales to Creative which rate
                    increased to 2% for monthly sales in excess of US$70,000, the plaintiff changed
                    course midstream and during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, he claimed that his
                    commission rate for sales to Creative was 5% commencing in 2003. After being
                    pressed further, the plaintiff eventually conceded that 5% was not his pleaded
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The next issue to address is the
                    plaintiff’s claim to commission from sales to Casio for which he relied on
                    cl 8 of the First Agreement which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event of termination of this agreement, REPRESENTATIVE shall be
                        entitled to full commission in accordance with paragraph 6, on all
                        subsequent orders placed by customers who had been previously referred by
                        REPRESENTATIVE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However, Casio was not a customer procured by
                    the plaintiff but the defendant’s own customer. Consequently, the
                    plaintiff was not entitled to commission from the defendant. However, the
                    defendant agreed to pay him commission nonetheless as a form of incentive to the
                    plaintiff to service Casio. Once the plaintiff stopped servicing Casio, he was
                    not entitled to any commission for sales to Casio as Casio was not a customer
                    that he had referred to the defendant under cl 8 above. Consequently, the
                    plaintiff has failed to make out his case for commission as regards sales to
                    Casio after June 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The last aspect of the plaintiff’s claim
                    related to his allegation that the defendant’s supply of defective PCBs to
                    MKI caused him loss in that his commission was reduced. The defendant contended
                    that it owed no duty at law to the plaintiff to supply goods of merchantable
                    quality to MKI, pointing out that if there was a term (whether express or
                    implied) that goods supplied must be of merchantable quality and/or fit for its
                    purpose, that was a term, if any, in the sale contract between the defendant and
                    MKI, to which the plaintiff was not a party; it was not a term in either of the
                    two agreements that governed the relationship between the plaintiff and the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In any case as the defendant pointed out, the
                    plaintiff by his own admission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> had no direct knowledge that
                    the defendant had supplied defective PCB to MKI, nor had he taken steps to
                    verify that MKI’s complaint in December 2004 was true. Neither did the
                    plaintiff call any witness from MKI to substantiate his allegation nor did he
                    have documentary evidence that the defendant had paid compensation to MKI for
                    supply of defective PCBs. His reliance on emails<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> exchanged between Danniel and
                    MKI’s representatives in that regard is misconceived – all that the
                    correspondence showed was that the two parties were making arrangements for the
                    defendant to test a sample of the allegedly defective PCBs. The plaintiff had
                    also relied on a document headed Pre-Agreement for PCBs problem dated
                    7 December 2004 (“the defects liability
                        agreement”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> signed
                    by the defendant and MKI which contents stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is to certify that we, Four Sea Circuit Board LTD is agreed to bear
                        all the cost which will be arises due to defect of our PCB Product (Part No.
                        LSJB2186-1 with week code 3504).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Payment term will be discussed after clear total amount; total amount will
                        be informed by MKI later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant submitted that on a plain
                    reading (to which the plaintiff agreed)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, all that the defects
                    liability agreement said was that the defendant agreed to bear all costs arising
                    from any defects in a particular model of PCBs, it did not reflect any agreement
                    by the defendant to pay compensation to MKI. MKI still had to prove that that
                    model of PCBs was defective before the defendant’s obligation to
                    compensate MKI arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I accept the defendant’s arguments. The
                    plaintiff’s claim in this regard is a non-starter and fails <em>in limine</em> on two counts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is trite law that a non-party to
                        a contract cannot make any claim thereunder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was no evidence that the defendant paid
                        any compensation to MKI pursuant to the defects liability agreement or
                        otherwise. Indeed, it was Danniel’s testimony that MKI continued to
                        place orders for PCBs after December 2004 with the defendant which conduct
                        would not be consistent with the defendant having supplied defective PCBs to
                        MKI previously and not having paid compensation for the same. The fact the
                        orders placed by MKI may have been less than those placed before December
                        2004 did not without more, mean that it was due to the defendant having sold
                        defective PCBs previously. There could be any number of commercial reasons
                        for MKI’s decision as the court pointed out to the
                            plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">I would add
                    that Danniel was a far more credible witness than the plaintiff. His testimony
                    was consistent with the documents that the defendant produced before the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Finally, although it was unnecessary for the
                    defendant to do so, it embarked on the time-consuming and expensive exercise of
                    engaging KPMG to verify the commissions paid to the plaintiff against his
                    contractual entitlement. It was noted from Yap’s report and supplementary
                    report (at exhibit D1) that the defendant’s payment of US$141,523.49 to
                    the plaintiff (which he admitted) was at rates higher than even those pleaded by
                    the plaintiff in his statement of claim. Regardless of whichever rates were
                    applied, the defendant had in effect overpaid the plaintiff as can be seen from
                    the following table:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the event, the plaintiff is not entitled to
                    any of the four reliefs (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>) that he
                    has claimed. He is not entitled to an account of all purchase orders received by
                    the defendant because the defendant has paid all that was due to him as
                    commission based on all the purchase orders it received and which were already
                    disclosed to him. There is no outstanding commission due to him from the
                    defendant. The plaintiff had waived the requirement of the defendant’s
                    opening of a bank account in Singapore. His claim for damages by way of reduced
                    commission arising from allegedly defective PCBs supplied by the defendant to
                    MKI has no basis at law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Consequently, I dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    claim with costs to the defendant.</p>
