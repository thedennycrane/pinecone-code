On 18 May 2020, the first respondent filed the Amendment Application to amend its D&amp;CC to introduce the Penalty Issue into the Arbitration, explaining the need for the amendment as follows: “[f]actual pleading necessitated for legal arguments” (see [23] above).

The claimant did not seek to comprehensively lead evidence on the Penalty Issue; counsel for the first respondent did not cross-examine the claimant’s witnesses or even put to them that clauses 10.2 and 11 of the Services Agreement were unenforceable penalties. In so far as there was <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence from the claimant’s witnesses relevant to the Penalty Issue, they were not challenged on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Until the end of the evidentiary hearing, the first respondent never asserted that there was any agreement or ruling that the Penalty Issue was already in issue in the Arbitration. As far as the parties were concerned, there was <span class="font-italic">no such agreement</span>, and <span class="font-italic">no such ruling</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 When the tribunal said, at the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing, that the Penalty Issue was already in issue in the Arbitration as of 13 May 2020, that was premised on a <span class="font-italic">non-existent agreement</span> between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As a result of its erroneous belief that the claimant had <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to the introduction of the Penalty Issue into the Arbitration, the tribunal failed to consider the claimant’s earlier <span class="font-italic">objection</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to the introduction of Penalty Issue -  that the Penalty Issue was unpleaded, irrelevant, and not at issue in the Arbitration (as stated in the 7 May 2020 Email, and reiterated during the 13 May 2020 Teleconference (see [44]-[45] and [48] above)); and that the Amendment Application seeking to introduce the Penalty Issue into the Arbitration should be disallowed because it was sought late in the day and would prejudice the claimant (as stated in the 20 May 2020 Email (see [23] above)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Although the tribunal did deal with the Amendment Application (ultimately dismissing it on 29 May 2020), it appears that the tribunal considered that to be of no consequence to whether the Penalty Issue was an issue in the Arbitration – to the tribunal, it already was an issue, as of 13 May 2020, because this had been agreed to by the parties (see [37]-[38] above). Thus, while the claimant was fighting to keep the Penalty Issue out of the Arbitration by resisting the Amendment Application, to the tribunal, the Penalty Issue was already “on the table … [and] in play” (as the tribunal would say, during the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing). The claimant did not know at the time that its victory in the Amendment Application was a pyrrhic one in the eyes of the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Subsequent developments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Following the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing, the claimant continued to object to the Penalty Issue being a live issue; but the tribunal continued to insist that it was. Throughout this process, the tribunal characterised the claimant’s objections as a mere complaint that it had not had sufficient time to put forward evidence on the Penalty Issue – so the tribunal first allowed, and then required, the claimant’s witnesses to return for questioning on the point.

The Claimant was on notice of <span class="font-underline">the English law issues, including the</span><span class="font-underline"> 1st Respondent’s challenge based on the penalty rule</span>, as of 28 April 2020, when the 1st Respondent circulated by email its List of Witnesses [Amended].

[The claimant] does not have any issue with [Mr M] acting as co-counsel in the arbitration. We further confirm that [the claimant] will not take a technical objection to the fact that [the first respondent] wishes to make submissions on the law of England.

It only proposed and agreed that “any [English law] issue … arising in this arbitration” be addressed by way of submissions instead of expert evidence. It <span class="font-italic">objected</span> to the introduction of issues that were unpleaded, irrelevant, and not in issue in the Arbitration, including the Penalty Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Although the tribunal referred to the claimant’s counsel’s 4 May 2020 Email to justify the tribunal’s ruling during the 13 May 2020 Teleconference, it does not appear that the tribunal had that email at the time; in any event, the 4 May 2020 Email shows that the claimant did not agree to the introduction of the Penalty Issue (see [41]-[42] above). Conspicuously, the tribunal did not refer to the claimant’s counsel’s 7 May 2020 Email objecting to the English law issues identified by the first respondent (including the Penalty Issue) as being irrelevant, unpleaded, and not at issue in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It thus appears from the Award that the tribunal persisted in its thinking, as stated at the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing, that the claimant had <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to the introduction of the Penalty Issue as an issue in the Arbitration. The tribunal failed to consider the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">objection</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to the same.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Should the tribunal’s decision on the Penalty Issue be set aside?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of natural justice / inability to put one’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In <span class="font-italic">Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2010] SGHC 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>”), the tribunal disregarded certain contentions of the respondent (“Front Row”) on the stated basis that Front Row had ceased to rely on them; in fact, Front Row had <span class="font-italic">not</span> ceased to rely on those points.

The claimant was denied the opportunity to address its objections to the mind of the tribunal (<span class="font-italic">Front Row</span> at [35]); the tribunal did not bring its mind to bear on an important aspect of the dispute before it (<span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span> at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The breach of natural justice caused the claimant actual, real prejudice. Had the tribunal considered the claimant’s objections, it might have decided not to allow the late introduction of the Penalty Issue into the Arbitration.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>, certain decisions of an Indonesian Ministry had made the performance of a “Management Contract” by the claimant (“Kempinski”) illegal save in certain ways (see <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> at [8], [14] and [72]). The respondent (“Prima”) argued that that it would be offensive to Indonesian public policy to award damages to Kempinski for the “Intervening Period” (between the date of purported termination of the Management Contract and the date of a new Management Contract); but Kempinski chose not to, and did not, address the tribunal on this (see <span class="font-italic">Kempinski </span>at [72]). The Court of Appeal held that the tribunal was entitled to decide that an award of damages for the Intervening Period would have been contrary to Indonesian public policy, although this had not been formally pleaded (see <span class="font-italic">Kempinski </span>at [72]-[75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It is noteworthy that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> said that a tribunal can take cognisance of public policy as a “question of law” (at [72]). In that case, the tribunal had all the evidence it needed to decide whether an award of damages for the Intervening Period would be contrary to Indonesian public policy. In the present case, however, whether a contractual clause is a penalty is not a pure question of law, it is a mixed question of law and fact (see [33] above). The tribunal denied the first respondent’s application to plead the Penalty Issue as a defence (and thereby supply the “factual pleading” for its intended legal arguments), only to find itself asking – at the stage of oral reply submissions – that the Penalty Issue be more fully addressed both in terms of evidence and submissions. Although the issue of whether a clause is a penalty does involve public policy considerations (<span class="font-italic">Cavendish Square Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> BV v El Makdessi and another appeal </span>[2016] 2 All ER 519 at [7] and [9]; <span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2020] SGCA 119<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [175]), <span class="font-italic">Banner Investments</span> ([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) shows that where such an issue is not properly before the decision maker, a decision on the issue is susceptible to being set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The SIAC Rules – in particular Rule 27(c), (f), (h) and (m) – give a tribunal powers to conduct enquiries, order production of documents, direct the giving of evidence, and to decide issues that have clearly been brought to the notice of the affected party with that party having been given adequate opportunity to respond. However, the tribunal must act fairly in exercising these powers. As Art 18 of the Model Law states: “[t]he parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case”. An award made in proceedings where Art 18 has been breached is susceptible to being set aside: <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span><span class="font-italic"> New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China </span><span class="font-italic">Machine</span>”) at [104(a)]. Furthermore, Rule 19.1 of the SIAC Rules, which states that “[t]he Tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, after consulting with the parties, to ensure the fair, expeditious, economical and final resolution of the dispute”, reinforces the tribunal’s obligation to act fairly (see also <span class="font-italic">CAI v CAJ and another</span> [2021] SGHC 21 at [218] on fairness in relation to a tribunal’s exercise of powers under Art 23(4) of the 2012 Rules of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The fact that a tribunal can take cognisance of public policy as a question of law (as recognised in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>), does not give it licence to act unfairly or in breach of natural justice. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang Chung and another</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 287 stated at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[t]he arbitrator is, subject to any procedure otherwise agreed between the parties as applying to the arbitration in question, master of his own procedure and has a wide discretionary power to conduct the arbitration proceedings in the way he sees fit, <span class="font-italic">so long as what he is doing is not manifestly unfair or </span><span class="font-italic">contrary to natural justice</span> [referring to Ronald Bernstein, Arthur Marriott and John Tackaberry, <span class="font-italic">Handbook of Arbitration Practice </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 1998)]  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In similar vein, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>stated at [2]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[i]n arbitration, the tribunal is ordinarily the master of its own procedure, but the <span class="font-italic">requirement of due process</span> is an essential limitation on the wide autonomy that the parties and the tribunal otherwise have with respect to procedure. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([91] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Kempinski’s argument to set aside the “Fourth Award” (in which the tribunal decided that an award of damages in favour of Kempinski for the Intervening Period was contrary to Indonesian public policy) was simply that the tribunal had exceeded the scope of its authority by deciding an issue that had not been formally pleaded (see <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> at [23(c)]). Kempinski did not otherwise contend that there was a breach of natural justice in the making of the Fourth Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, there was a breach of natural justice in the way the tribunal concluded that the Penalty Issue had become an issue in the Arbitration: it misapprehended that the claimant had <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to what it was, in fact, <span class="font-italic">objecting</span> to. That misapprehension continued through to the making of the Award, with the tribunal persistently failing to engage with the claimant’s objections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Had the tribunal considered the claimant’s objections to the late introduction of the Penalty Issue, the tribunal might have decided not to allow the first respondent to introduce the issue; the tribunal might then have decided against taking the initiative to introduce the issue itself.

Whether or not the tribunal was amenable to receiving submissions on English law, the tribunal’s rejection of the first respondent’s Amendment Application to plead the Penalty Issue as a defence signalled to the parties that this was not an issue in the Arbitration.

</div> This is cold comfort: the relevant prejudice from the tribunal’s failure to consider the claimant’s objections to the late introduction of the Penalty Issue, is that the claimant lost the reasonable opportunity of keeping that issue out of the Arbitration. Had the tribunal considered and accepted the claimant’s objections, there would be no question of the claimant then needing to put in further evidence, or its witnesses being recalled, or its claims ultimately being dismissed based on the Penalty Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The claimant was entitled to decide to take a stand on its objections. Accordingly: it only repeated evidence already given, that was relevant to the Penalty Issue; and it declined to recall its witnesses for questioning.

Instead, the claimant quite properly reiterated its objections to the Penalty Issue being in issue in the Arbitration, but the tribunal persistently failed to engage with those objections – what the tribunal did <span class="font-italic">does not</span> fall within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done (<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> at [98]–[104]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the circumstances, the parts of the Award affected by the Penalty Issue ought properly to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Exceeding the scope of the arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The claimant also contended that the Penalty Issue was outside the scope of submission to arbitration, and that this afforded a further ground to set aside the affected parts of the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the present case, the tribunal had at the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing and thereafter indicated that it considered the Penalty Issue to be an issue in the Arbitration. Objectively, the Penalty Issue was not an issue in the Arbitration prior to 17 June 2020, and neither party thought it was. The tribunal’s remarks at the 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing would have come as a revelation (and indeed, a shock – particularly to the claimant). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In the preceding section, I have concluded that the Penalty Issue was never properly introduced into the Arbitration – instead, the tribunal acted in breach of natural justice. In the circumstances, the tribunal’s dismissal of the claimant’s claims on the basis of the Penalty Issue was outside the scope of the Arbitration.

The parties also agreed on a procedural timetable that was embodied in PO 1. This contemplated that there would be pleadings, document production, witness statements, oral testimony, and then closing submissions. Certain timelines were adjusted as agreed between the parties, as reflected in PO 2, but it was still contemplated that the matter would proceed towards an evidentiary hearing, written closing submissions, oral reply submissions on 17 June 2020, and the final award being issued by 1 July 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 What happened instead was that on 17 June 2020, the tribunal indicated that it regarded the Penalty Issue to be an issue in the Arbitration (and that it was in issue since the 13 May 2020 Teleconference). This led to the tribunal asking that the Penalty Issue be addressed more fully, including allowing and then requiring the claimant to recall its witnesses for questioning on the issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Penalty Issue was never pleaded as a defence by the first respondent – its Amendment Application to plead this in its D&amp;CC was dismissed by the tribunal.

The tribunal also did not provide for the <span class="font-italic">first </span><span class="font-italic">respondent</span>’s witnesses to return to be cross-examined on the Penalty Issue but only ordered that the <span class="font-italic">claimant’s</span> witnesses do so. Had the Penalty Issue been pleaded in the original D&amp;CC, it would have been dealt with quite differently from the way things actually transpired - with the tribunal expecting the claimant to respond to the Penalty Issue only at the stage of oral reply submissions – in short order, and in a limited fashion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The 17 June 2020 Oral Reply Hearing (at which the tribunal raised the Penalty Issue) was intended by the parties to be the last stage of the proceedings, before the issuance of the award.

In relation to the granting of the Confidentiality Relief in and of itself, there are no grounds for setting it aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I should however like to hear from the parties on whether the Confidentiality Relief is affected by my decision to set aside the tribunal’s decision on the Penalty Issue. As the tribunal noted, the claimant had in the Arbitration produced or relied upon information or documents which the Confidentiality Relief would apply to. The Confidentiality Relief (requiring destruction of data or materials within 30 days) is part of an award that had dealt with all the disputes between the parties, but I have decided that the decision on the Penalty Issue should be set aside. In the present circumstances, should the claimant be required to implement the Confidentiality Relief when the claimant’s claims may yet be determined in a new arbitration?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For the present, I grant the claimant’s application to set aside: (a) paragraphs 110-128 and 141(a) of the Award, on the Penalty Issue; and (b) paragraphs 139-140 and 141(f) of the Award, on the tribunal’s costs decision. I will hear further from the parties before finally deciding what (if anything) should be done with paragraphs 134 and 141(e) of the Award on the Confidentiality Relief.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In the present case, the claimant’s claims were dismissed on the basis of the Penalty Issue, with the tribunal thinking that the claimant had <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> to the late introduction of that issue, when in fact the claimant had <span class="font-italic">objected</span> to this (and kept objecting). There was a breach of natural justice prejudicing the claimant, the tribunal had exceeded the scope of submission to arbitration, and the tribunal had acted contrary to the arbitral procedure agreed between the parties. Accordingly, I set aside the tribunal’s decision on the Penalty Issue, and the parts of the Award affected by it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I will hear the parties further on the Confidentiality Relief, costs, and consequential matters.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Daniel Chia, Ker Yanguang, Jeanette Wong</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K Sathinathan, J Jayanthi (Lincoln’s Law LLC) for the respondents</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
