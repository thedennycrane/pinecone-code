<p class="Judg-1-FirstPara" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns="">
<span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 21 December 2992, the judgment creditor Sincere Watch Limited (“Sincere Watch”) obtained judgment in the present action against the judgment debtor Bakery Mart Pte Ltd (“Bakery”) for $1,971,264.11 comprising a principal sum of $1,930,000, interest and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Pursuant to the judgment, Sincere Watch applied for and obtained on 21 December 2002 a Garnishee Order To Show Cause against the garnishee, Ng Yew Hong, who is also known as Charles Ng (“NYH”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> NYH was and is a director of Bakery.</span>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The accounting records of Bakery showed that NYH was owing Bakery $707,431.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, NYH was owed $300,000 for director’s fees and claimed to set-off the $300,000 against what was supposedly owed by him to Bakery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In view of this claim of set-off, the Assistant Registrar who heard the matter when the Garnishee Order To Show Cause came up for hearing, deferred his decision on the $300,000 but made a Garnishee Order Absolute in respect of the balance i.e $407,431.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> NYH then appealed and his appeal was heard by me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I dismissed his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> NYH has appealed to the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Reasons for decision</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Before the Assistant Registrar, NYH relied on an affidavit of Lee Sung Fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Lee is the auditor of Bakery but Lee said that he was signing his affidavit in his capacity as an accountant and not as an auditor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is significant that all Lee said in his affidavit was that he had been informed by the directors of Bakery that entries made in Bakery’s audited accounts were not reflective of the actual position of the amount due from NYH to Bakery and he was instructed to adjust the accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The intended adjustment was to reduce the sum owing by NYH and to pass on to others the amount or amounts by which NYH’s debt was reduced.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> After hearing arguments, the Assistant Registrar did not accept the intended adjustment and made the Garnishee Order Absolute I have mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Before me, Mr Ismail Atan, Counsel for NYH, orally sought leave to admit an affidavit of NYH which had been served on Sincere Watch’s solicitors at 6.38pm of the day before the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was objected to by Sincere Watch’s Counsel, Mr Roland Tong and Counsel for the Receiver &amp; Manager of Bakery, Mr Ng Yeow Khoon.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> This latest affidavit of NYH exhibited the latest audited accounts of Bakery as at 31 March 2002, purportedly signed on 31 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It purported to show a reduced sum of $375,920 owing by NYH to Bakery which was different from the $367,431 balance which would have resulted if the Assistant Registrar had accepted the intended adjustment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Mr Atan sought to justify his oral application on the basis that the AGM of Bakery was on 28 February 2003 and Bakery’s secretary was tasked to file the Accounts and Annual Returns with the Registry of Companies and Businesses but failed to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly, NYH had to file the same himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Atan sought to explain why, if the audited accounts had indeed been signed on 13 January 2003, Lee did not exhibit them in his affidavit which he had signed on 15 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Atan’s explanation was that he had at that time asked Lee whether the audited accounts were available and Lee had said that the audited accounts were with the directors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Atan had tried to contact them but they were not contactable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, even if this was so, NYH had himself filed an affidavit on 17 January 2003 but yet the audited accounts were not exhibited to his affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition, the existence of these signed audited accounts were not disclosed to the Assistant Registrar at the hearing before him on 13 February 2003.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Therefore, I was of the view that the accounts were signed after 13 January 2003 and back-dated or, if indeed signed on or before 13 January 2003, they were deliberately withheld by NYH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> NYH was trying to be clever in raising the signed audited accounts at the appeal stage before me in an attempt to overcome the Assistant Registrar’s decision in rejecting the intended adjustment of the figures concerning his debt to Bakery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any event, the audited accounts as at 31 March 2002 did not add anything material to what Lee had said in his affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> All they would show was that the intention to reduce the debt owing by NYH to Bakery by adjusting the accounts had been carried out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That did not mean that the adjustment had been validly done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the circumstances, I refused to grant the leave sought by Mr Atan’s oral application.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> In the circumstances, Mr Atan no longer attempted to persuade me that the amount owing by NYH to Bakery should be reduced and confined his submission to arguing that there was no debt “due” or “accruing due” to Bakery from NYH as at the date of the Garnishee Order Nisi so as to avoid the making of a Garnishee Order Absolute.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Ng Yeow Khoon and Mr Tong took an opposing position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their respective clients had reached an agreement on what to do with the $407,431 if a Garnishee Order Absolute was made in respect of this sum.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Tong submitted that the audited accounts of Bakery as at 31 March 2001 (which was the then latest audited accounts filed with the Registry of Companies and Businesses) had described the monies owing by NYH as being “due” from NYH, that is:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> in the Director’s Current Account, the following words are used, “Balance due by Charles Ng (meaning NYH) to Bakery Mart”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">       </span> ( p 11 of Ling Daw Hoang Philip’s affidavit filed on 24 December 2002),</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> in the Balance Sheet, the debt from NYH is described as “Amount due from a director” (p 18 of Ling’s said affidavit),</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> in Note 10 to the Accounts the heading reads, “Amount Due From A Director”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> On the other hand, Mr Atan submitted that under the heading for Note 10, the debt was described in the following terms:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">The amount due from a director is unsecured, interest-free and repayable on demand</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Mr Atan further submitted that at the hearing before the Assistant Registrar, Mr Tong had accepted that the debt from NYH was repayable on demand.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The arguments then focussed on the assumption that NYH’s debt was repayable on demand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Atan’s point was that since the debt was repayable on demand, it could not be garnished in the absence of a demand by Bakery on NYH.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Atan further submitted that Parliament had accepted the position that a debt payable on demand is not due until demand is made and because of that, O 49 r 1(3) of the Rules of Court had to be introduced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Order 49 rule 1(3) states:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">In this order, “any debt due or accruing due” includes a current or deposit account with a bank or other financial institution, whether or not the deposit has matured and notwithstanding any restriction as to the mode of withdrawal.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Leaving aside the fact that it was not Parliament but the Rules Committee which made O 49 r 1(3), I accepted Mr Tong’s submission that if O 49 r 1(3) did effect a change, it was not in the manner suggested by Mr Atan.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Under the common law, if there was a credit balance in the current account of a judgment debtor held in a bank, the balance could be garnished by the judgment creditor notwithstanding that there had been no prior demand made by the judgment debtor on the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The service of the Garnishee Order Nisi would constitute the demand, see (a) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rekstir v Severo Sibirsko Gosudarstvennoe Akcionernoe Obschestvo Komseverputj and The Bank for Russian Trade, Limited</i> [1933] 1 KB 47, (b) the judgment of Sir Raymond Evershed MR in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bagley v Winsome and National Provincial Bank, Ltd</i> [1952] 2 QB 236 at p 639 and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">      </span> (c) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Arab Bank, Ltd v Barclays Bank</i> [1954] 2 All ER 226.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In so far as Mr Atan relied on a decision by Justice Rajendran in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">CIC Video International v Forward International Singapore Pte Ltd and Wo Kee Hong (Singapore) Pte Ltd</i> (Suit No 1111 of 1998), the facts there were different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The garnishee’s position was that there was an understanding between it and the judgment debtor that it would only pay the loan if and when it was able to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, Rajendran J noted that the description of the loan was “interest free, unsecured and had no fixed repayment term”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The judge then decided that when a loan is made without fixed repayment terms, it is generally repayable at once without any previous demand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The judge did not decide that if the loan was repayable on demand, a garnishee order could not be made without a prior demand by the judgment debtor on the garnishee.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Accordingly, under the common law, there was no difficulty in garnishing monies in a current account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In my view, a loan repayable on demand would likewise be liable to be garnished without the need for a prior demand by the judgment debtor on the garnishee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, there was some difficulty about garnishing monies in a fixed deposit or time deposit account or an account where there was some restriction on the mode of withdrawal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An example of the latter is the case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bagley v Winsome</i> which I have mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In my view, O 49 r 1(3) was intended to ensure that as regards both a current and a deposit account, the same rule would apply notwithstanding that the deposit has not yet matured and notwithstanding any restriction as to the mode of withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Therefore, I dismissed the appeal of NYH.</span></p>
