The only direct evidence that was before the court below was the testimony of the nurse. The victim was unfit to testify as she was suffering from cognitive impairment.

Nurse MJ stated that this crying sound was the same sound that the victim would make whenever the victim was in pain. Nurse MJ said that she could see Bed 7 as the curtain to Bed 7 was only half drawn.

Mr T reviewed the CCTV footage of the incident the following day (28 November 2016). He said that he was shocked to see the appellant, a male staff, enter an all-female room unescorted. A male staff member cannot enter an all-female room unless he had the permission of the staff nurse on duty and there is no one inside the room. Mr T said that he then confronted the appellant on the matter. The appellant told Mr T that he was merely doing some work for a resident. Mr T explained that he did not speak to Nurse MJ as he spoke Hindi whereas she spoke Tamil. He then decided that he would not be taking further action as yet since he was new to the job and was trying to obtain more information.

His reason for being in Room 5 was that he had been asked to fix the portable television belonging to the resident of Bed 8, Resident JP. He had met Resident JP in the dining hall on the third floor before lunch time. She asked him to help repair her portable television as she wanted to watch shows on Channel 8. According to the appellant, this was not the first time Resident JP had approach him for assistance to fix her television.

When he reached Bed 8, he noticed that the curtain was drawn. He had to therefore pull the curtain apart by a little to go to Bed 8. Resident JP was not at her bed. The appellant tried to switch the television on to check if there was power, but there was none. He opened up the plug and saw that the fuse was burnt. He thus took the fuse from the power cable that he had brought along with him and replaced the burnt fuse with it. He then switched the television on and there was power. He also tried tuning the television to receive Channel 8. During the time he was fiddling with the television, the appellant claimed to have been kneeling between Beds 7 and 8 and had placed the television in the middle of Bed 8.

It sounded as if someone was tapping at the bed or railing. The beds had railings along the sides to prevent the residents from falling off. The appellant said that when he turned his head, he saw the victim’s head touching the railing on the left side of the bed. He heard the tapping two to three times. The curtain to Bed 7, in between Beds 7 and 8, was opened at the material time. The appellant stated that he could see that the victim was in pain. He thought that she was asking for some help. He also saw that her pillow was out of place. He then stood up, went to Bed 7 and adjusted her head to the middle of the bed. He then put the pillow under her head. He also took a round pillow from the far side of Bed 7 and placed it on the left side of the victim in between her head and the bed railing so that she would not fall off again. In his hurry, and to reach for the round pillow, the appellant said that he placed his left knee in between the vertical bars of the bed railing on the left. The appellant demonstrated this to the District Judge during a site visit.

She confirmed that her portable television had broken down and that she had asked the appellant to attend to the matter. In this connection, she explained that she could not switch on her television, the adaptor was dislodged and she could not receive Channel 8 programmes on her television. During cross-examination, Resident JP clarified that the problem relating to power was that the adaptor was always loose and she had difficulty attaching it firmly to the power cable of her television because of her disability. Once the adaptor was firmly attached, there would be power to the television.

The appellant explained that there were accusations of him having told Nurse MJ’s landlord not to provide accommodation for Nurse MJ and her flatmates. The appellant also related another incident where Nurse MJ and her friend had dropped certain fruits and vegetables on the floor. He had told them that he would have to clean up after them, and there was an exchange of words between the appellant, and Nurse MJ and her friends. The appellant said that Nurse MJ looked annoyed. At the trial, the appellant further suggested that there was a bad working relationship between him and his supervisor. Nurse MJ and his supervisor thus sought to blow up the issue.

</div> The District Judge also concluded that Nurse MJ’s evidence was both internally and externally consistent. He noted Nurse MJ’s reaction to the events – Nurse MJ had immediately left the room to seek Nurse DS’s assistance to check on Bed 7 after witnessing the incident and had also met SSN JS to tell her what she saw. In doing so, the District Judge accepted that it was reasonable of Nurse MJ to not have immediately raised alarm about what she had seen as she was in shock.

The offence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt; it is not enough to show that the accused person probably did it, or most likely did it. What must be shown is that there are no other reasonable explanations that point to innocence.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A substantial challenge in cases of sexual abuse or assault is that such crimes often occur in seclusion, with no other witnesses present, and the objective evidence is often sparse. The court is usually left to weigh the words of one person over another. The difficulties in fact-finding are multiplied, as is the case here, if the victim is unable to testify and all that is before the court is the testimony of a third-party eye witness. It is against this context that the court requires the evidence against the accused person to be unusually convincing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As it was in the present case, while I saw no reason to doubt the District Judge’s conclusion that Nurse MJ was honest, it was unsafe to convict the appellant on her evidence alone. Taking the evidence as a whole, I found that there remained reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 While it is true that an appellate judge would rarely review a trial judge’s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 61 at [91]), an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]–[38].<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ultimately, the appellate court would have to scrutinise the trial judge’s decision to determine if the first instance determination did correctly assess whether the case was proven beyond a reasonable doubt: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton M</span><span class="font-italic">ohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”) as reproduced at [31] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As stated, evidential hurdles often arise in the context of sexual assault. In such circumstances, where conviction rests solely on the testimony of the complainant, the evidence of the complainant would have to be “unusually convincing” so as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration: <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]. Guidance was given in <span class="font-italic">Liton </span>at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, therefore, the “extra something” implied by the word “unusually” must refer to the need for the trial judge to be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on the complainant’s testimony as well as of the importance of convicting only on testimony that, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused. Since a mandatory warning from the judge to himself is not required, the implication is that the appellate courts will scrutinise the trial judge’s grounds of decision to see whether the trial judge was indeed aware of the danger of convicting on the bare word of the complainant as well as whether the quality of the testimony itself was consistent with the high standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing are the demeanour of the complainant, as well as the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’s testimony: <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [115]. These factors are not exhaustive or conclusive. The evidence will ultimately have to be assessed in the round, with the exercise of reason and common sense. The unusually convincing standard does not change the rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 A third-party witness who is disinterested and neutral may not appear to require the cautionary approach embodied by the need for evidence to be unusually convincing. Nonetheless, as the evidence remains word against word, a similar imperative applies: the court should be slow to convict in the absence of unusually convincing evidence. Hence, the District Judge was not wrong in transposing the unusually convincing requirement to an eye-witness. But even if that requirement were not applied to Nurse MJ, her evidence would not have been sufficient to secure a conviction simply because it fell short of the required cogency and strength that on any non-sexual case would be required for a conviction to stand: a reasonable doubt that she was mistaken could not be excluded. So on either the application of the unusually convincing requirement, or otherwise, the evidence for the prosecution did not make out a case beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The difficulties with Nurse MJ’s testimony as a third-party eye witness account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The facts of the present case fell out of the ordinary. As the District Judge noted, it is one of those rare cases involving the outrage of modesty where there was an independent witness to the offence. At the same time, the victim herself was unable to testify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 While there is no reason to doubt that Nurse MJ was truthful and candid, her evidence of the appellant’s sexual assault on the victim was not definitive and conclusive of the matter, and there were gaps in the evidence that were not adequately addressed. The question in each case is whether, given the evidence presented, the doubt is a real or reasonable doubt or whether it was a merely illusory or fanciful one: <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Seng v Public Prosecutor </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 444 at [96]. And in making such an assessment, the available evidence and absence of evidence must be taken into account: <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Nurse MJ was a bystander. She was not the victim. While an eye witness’s testimony has the advantage of being an independent account of the events, eye witness evidence is always subject to possible misapprehension and errors in observation. In contrast to a victim’s own testimony, an eye witness’s account would be subject to a greater degree of misperception, misapprehension and misattribution. This is particularly so where the incident might have taken place over a period of time and the eye witness was only present for a brief moment. Without an appreciation of the full context in which the events unfolded, a bystander’s account may be liable to misinterpretation. An eye witness’s testimony is not a recording. In the context of a civil claim, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others </span>[2014] 3 SLR 562 at [47]–[49] stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Caution should also be exercised when relying on the uncorroborated recollections of a witness. In this regard, we note that memory is more than a reinstatement of the original perception, and often involves the interpretation and/or reinterpretation of details, judgment, estimates and the correlation of related incidents. Put another way, memory more closely resembles a synthesis of experiences rather than a replay of a videotape …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Moreover, the witness’s original perception of the event or detail “may be defective and illusory; wrong associations may make it imperfect; judgments may misinterpret the experience; and suggestive influence may falsify the data of the senses” …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As I noted above, I agreed with the District Judge that the “unusually convincing” standard may be applied to both victim and third-party eye witness accounts. However, the various difficulties mentioned above go towards the reliability of an eye witness’s evidence. In this relation, the District Judge found Nurse MJ to have been credible. However, credibility does not guarantee reliability. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sufficiency of Nurse MJ’s evidence alone</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The question in the present case is whether Nurse MJ’s testimony was sufficient to safely convict the appellant, bearing in mind the matters above and the absence of strong corroborating evidence. A key aspect of the District Judge’s decision was that Nurse MJ could not have been mistaken as to what she saw. However, as I have explained above, it must be appreciated that Nurse MJ’s perception of the matter would be weaker than the account of the victim. The incident might well have transpired. But having examined the existing state of the evidence as a whole, I did not find that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Nurse MJ had only about a five-second glimpse of the alleged assault. She may have indeed seen something, or she may have been mistaken. The possibility of mistake or misapprehension is higher the shorter the observation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Additionally, according to Nurse MJ, the victim was crying at the material time. However, when Nurse DS quietly entered the room 1 minute and 20 seconds later, he observed the victim to be asleep and that she “looked normal”:

Yet, when Nurse DS entered the room shortly after Nurse MJ left, the victim was asleep and the appellant was at Bed 8 using his phone.

</div> Given the activity that was going on in the room, more would be required to corroborate Nurse MJ’s testimony. To this end, the District Judge came to a conclusion that Nurse MJ’s evidence was, to some extent, corroborated by CCTV footage, SSN JS’s evidence and Nurse DS’s evidence. But such evidence was not sufficiently strong as to overcome the possibility of mistake or misapprehension. The CCTV footage only confirmed a limited sequence of events: when the appellant entered into the room, when Nurse MJ left the room and when Nurse DS entered the room, among other things. It did not prove that the appellant had indeed committed the acts as charged. Similarly, SSN JS’s and Nurse DS’s evidence only showed that Nurse MJ was truly convicted of what she saw. It was not direct proof of the facts relating to the appellant’s guilt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The various aforementioned issues left something to be desired. It is unfortunate that there were lost opportunities in the present case, particularly in the reaction of the Home to the complaint of the incident. The victim was not promptly examined for physical signs of sexual assault. However, the court has to ultimately work within the constraints of the evidence as adduced by the Prosecution and resist the temptation of reading more into the existing evidence, especially in situations where there could have been evidence that would have strengthened a point but was not adduced. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Inconsistencies in the appellant’s and Resident JP’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The inconsistencies in the evidence of the appellant and Resident JP did not go towards supporting or corroborating Nurse MJ’s evidence. The weakness of a defence does not in and of itself translate into strength of the Prosecution’s evidence. It bears mentioning that the court does not have to believe an accused’s evidence to acquit the accused. But to secure a conviction, the Prosecution’s evidence must be sufficient to meet the standard required to prove the facts: see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and The Litigation Process</span> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at para 12.008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, while there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the appellant – particularly about what happened at Bed 7 – the inconsistencies were not such as to render his version of events untenable or to prevent reasonable doubt from being raised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 One key discrepancy in the appellant’s evidence was his posture when he was tending to the victim. The appellant testified that he had placed his left knee between the vertical bars of the bed railing on the left side of the bed to reach for the pillow. However, the appellant’s statement to the police was that he had placed both his knees on the left side of the bed. While the appellant’s evidence was inconsistent as to the position of his knees, the wider point was that on his version, he was attempting to adjust the victim’s head onto the pillow and reach for another pillow to support her head. It was consistent with this version that his posture might have been misperceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The District Judge also impeached the credit of Resident JP on the basis that her evidence was inconsistent. However, it is not any inconsistency that would be liable to impeachment. Resident JP’s evidence, though inconsistent, should not have been impeached. Section 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">157. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) by proof of the former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It should be noted that the permissive word “may” is used. In other words, the fulfilment of the condition in s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that the credit of the witness is impeached. It is not infrequent that the court is faced with inconsistent evidence of a witness. However, it is not any sort of inconsistency that would result in the impeachment of a witness’s credit. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211 at [19] noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To impeach a witness’ credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of the impeachment of a witness’s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The threshold in s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act ought to be a high one. I did not find the evidence of Resident JP to have been so materially inconsistent that would warrant her impeachment. While Resident JP might not have been precise as to when she had asked the appellant to repair her portable television, the wider point is that she did ask the appellant to repair her portable television. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The District Judge noted that when Resident JP was confronted with her statement about the precise date of her request, Resident JP said that she recalled her request to be on 26 November 2016 because of counsel’s repeated reference to that date.
