Art 36 of the Model Law, found in Chapter VIII, prescribes the grounds on which a court may refuse to recognise or enforce an award. Unlike the remainder of the Model Law, Chapter VIII is not given the force of law in Singapore by s 3(1) of the Act. It is common ground, however, that an application to resist enforcement of an award under s 19 can succeed only on one of the grounds prescribed in Art 36 (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v </span><span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372 at [84]).

The respondent therefore required a hearing to present and test <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> critical evidence going to the issue of fraud and corruption. The arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only deprived the respondent of that opportunity. The respondent was therefore unable to present its case in the arbitration within the meaning of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii).</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Because the parties’ contract was procured by fraud and corruption, enforcing the award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore within the meaning of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having considered the parties’ submissions and evidence, I have dismissed the respondent’s application. In brief, I have found as follows. First, s 2A(6) of the Act operated on the facts of this case to deem there to be an effective arbitration agreement between the parties. It therefore does not matter whether the parties’ contract contains an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1) of the Act and whether the parties’ contract was procured by fraud or corruption. Second, the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only did not leave the respondent unable to present its case in the arbitration. In any event, proceeding documents-only caused no prejudice to the respondent. Finally, even assuming that the parties’ contract was procured by fraud and corruption, there is nothing contrary to public policy in the arbitration or the award. And the respondent was aware of the fraud and corruption during the arbitration but deliberately declined to raise the issue for the arbitrator to determine. The respondent therefore cannot resist enforcement of the award on the public policy ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The respondent has appealed against my decision.

The evidence in question had not been placed before the tribunal when it determined the issue of jurisdiction for itself. Leow JC’s decision to apply a modified <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test was left undisturbed on appeal to the Court of Appeal (<span class="font-italic">Sanum Investments Ltd v Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic</span> [2016] 5 SLR 536 at [17] and [28]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 An authority to the opposite effect of <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span> is the decision of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 at [59]. That is also a decision on an application under s 10(3) of the Act. As Prakash J held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is nothing … which restricts parties from adducing new material that was not before the arbitrator. Parties can adduce new evidence in the affidavits they file in the originating summons and if there is a need, the court may order the deponents to appear and be cross-examined on the new evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I do not need to address the applicant’s evidential objection directly. For the reasons which I set out in the remainder of these grounds, even if I were to receive and consider all of this additional evidence and even if I were to assume all of it to be true, I would still hold the award to be enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 If I had to address this objection directly, however, I would accept that my discretion to receive the additional evidence is unconstrained by the<span class="font-italic"> Ladd </span><span class="font-italic">v Marshall </span>test. I do not consider that the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test – even by analogy and even in modified form – ought to constrain the court’s discretion to receive or reject evidence on an application to resist enforcement of an award under s 19 of the Act. I say that for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test upholds the procedural interest in imposing a degree of finality in the parties’ opportunity to obtain and produce evidence in dispute-resolution proceedings. But that interest is engaged only when a party makes a <span class="font-italic">second</span> attempt to adduce evidence on the same issue as against the same party. For example, that interest is engaged when a court is asked to determine the issue of a tribunal’s jurisdiction under s 10(3) of the Act. <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span> was such an application. The applicant in <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span> had had an opportunity to obtain and produce evidence on the issue of jurisdiction when the tribunal determined the issue. That is no doubt why Leow JC felt it appropriate to apply a modified <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test to the applicant’s attempt to adduce further evidence before him. That is also no doubt why the Court of Appeal left his approach undisturbed on appeal. Even then, as <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> shows (see [39] above), views at first instance differ on whether this is the correct approach to an attempt to adduce additional evidence on an application under s 10(3) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In any event, the interest in evidential finality is not engaged on an application like this one, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an application to set aside leave to enforce an award under s 19 of the Act. This application is neither an appeal against the award nor an appeal against the decision granting the applicant leave to enforce the award under s 19 of the Act. The respondent has never before had an opportunity to obtain and produce evidence on the set of issues to be determined on this application. There is, to my mind, no analogy to be drawn between this application and an application of the type in <span class="font-italic">Sanum</span>. There is therefore no procedural interest which justifies constraining the general discretion to receive relevant and admissible evidence on the hearing of an application by way of an interlocutory summons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, constraining the general discretion to receive evidence is not necessary to deter potential tactical abuse on an application like this. There are other doctrines and principles which suffice to deter potential abuse. The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and the principle of minimal curial intervention prevent a party from rearguing issues which were or could have been argued before the tribunal. And even if additional evidence is produced and received, there is always the court’s power to draw adverse inferences and to assess critically the weight to be given to that evidence in all the circumstances of the case. Those circumstances include whether the evidence could have been obtained and produced earlier and the manner in which it has now been obtained and produced. Finally, potential tactical abuse is also deterred by the usual power to award costs, and to award indemnity costs in appropriate cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As such, even if I were to address directly the applicant’s objection to the respondent’s additional evidence, I would consider myself free to exercise my discretion to receive or reject this evidence unconstrained by even a modified <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 And if I thought it necessary to consider the exercise of that discretion, I would exercise it in favour of receiving the respondent’s additional evidence. I say that for three reasons. First, it appears to me that the issues raised on this setting aside application make receiving at least Mr Saiful’s WeChat conversation and affidavit of critical importance. The evidence offers direct support to the respondent’s case that there are serious issues of fraud and corruption which taint the parties’ contract. Those issues are of potentially fundamental relevance to the respondent’s first and third grounds (see [3] above). Second, there is no basis to reject out of hand, on affidavit evidence alone, Ms Choo’s evidence that she could not obtain and produce Mr Saiful’s evidence earlier than July 2019. Finally, the applicant is prepared to argue this application even if this additional evidence is admitted and without adducing any additional evidence of its own.

</div> Receiving the evidence will therefore not require the hearing to be adjourned for applicant’s counsel to take instructions and to file affidavits in response.

Section 2A(6) reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where in any arbitral or legal proceedings, a party asserts the existence of an arbitration agreement in a pleading, statement of case or any other document in circumstances in which the assertion calls for a reply and the assertion is not denied, there shall be deemed to be an effective arbitration agreement as between the parties to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The applicant (through Kennedys as its solicitors) asserted the existence of an arbitration agreement with the respondent twice in the course of the arbitration.

That submission may well be correct generally (see <span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd v Hualon Corp (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (receiver and manager appointed)</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1207 at [43]). But I consider the submission not to be correct when considering the type of denial which s 2A(6) of the Act requires.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, s 2A(6) requires a respondent to deny with specificity a claimant’s assertion that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. It will not suffice for the respondent generally to deny the existence of an arbitration agreement if it does not go on to deny with specificity the arbitration agreement as asserted by the claimant. <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, it will not suffice for the respondent generally to deny the existence of the contract which the claimant asserts contains an arbitration clause if it does not go on to deny with specificity the claimant’s assertion that that clause is a valid arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I come to this conclusion for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 First, the language of s 2A(6) expressly requires the respondent to deny the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">assertion</span>: “Where…a party asserts the existence of an arbitration agreement…and the <span class="font-italic">assertion</span> is not denied” (emphasis added). Denying generally that a contract exists between the parties does not address the target of s 2A(6), which is the claimant’s assertion that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Second, only a specific denial of a claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement advances what I consider to be the twin purposes of s 2A(6): (a) to promote efficiency in the allocation of dispute-resolution resources; and (b) to avoid defeating the reasonable expectations of stakeholders in dispute-resolution proceedings. These twin purposes are why s 2A(6) operates expressly not only in arbitration but generally in all dispute-resolution proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Assume a claimant who asserts expressly in dispute-resolution proceedings that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. Assume also that the respondent’s reply to the claimant denies generally that a contract exists between the parties but fails specifically to deny the assertion that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 These dispute resolution proceedings will have many stakeholders. The stakeholders will include: (a) the claimant; (b) its legal representatives; (c) the court or other adjudicating institution; and (d) the actual or potential factual or expert witnesses who have been approached or who have agreed to give evidence in the proceedings on one side or the other. In arbitration, these stakeholders will in addition include the administering institution (if any) and the arbitrators approached by the parties or the institution for actual or potential appointment to the tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The respondent’s general denial of a contract between the parties is ambiguous. Because the denial is not directed specifically to the claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement, it is indistinguishable from an assertion by the respondent that it has a defence on the merits of the claim but accepts that it is bound to arbitrate those merits. Stakeholders will therefore assume from the respondent’s failure to deny the assertion of an arbitration agreement that the respondent accepts that the asserted arbitration agreement exists. This assumption will be entirely foreseeable, entirely understandable and entirely reasonable. Relying on the respondent’s failure, the stakeholders will incur or continue incurring actual costs, time costs and opportunity costs in preparing for the dispute to be resolved on the expectation that the respondent accepts the claimant’s asserted arbitration agreement. Stakeholder expectations will be defeated and dispute-resolution resources wasted if the respondent retains the liberty at any point in the future of those proceedings to deny the asserted arbitration agreement – and thereby to nullify all that it has allowed to transpire in those proceedings up to that point – when it allowed the assertion to pass without specific denial. This waste of resources has a systemic effect. It operates to the prejudice of parties and stakeholders in unrelated disputes which had an equal claim on the scarce dispute-resolution resources which have now been wasted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I conclude for these reasons that the twin purposes of s 2A(6) require a respondent to deny specifically a claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement. A general denial does not suffice to address the twin purposes of s 2A(6). It does not put stakeholders on notice that dispute-resolution resources may be wasted and expectations may be defeated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Third, s 2A(6) must require the same specificity for a respondent’s denial whether or not the underlying claim arises from a contract and, if it does, whether or not the contract contains a defective arbitration clause. By way of illustration, assume the three following hypothetical respondents to a hypothetical arbitration of a hypothetical claim: (a) a respondent to a claim which does not arise out of a contract but which the parties have apparently agreed <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> to refer to arbitration;  (b) a respondent to a claim arising out of a contract which contains no arbitration clause at all; and (c) a respondent to a claim arising out of a contract which contains a defective arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Section 2A(6) applies in all three of these hypothetical arbitrations. That is because the twin purposes of s 2A(6) are engaged in all three of them. They each entail the same risk of wasted resources and of defeated expectations if a respondent fails specifically to deny a claimant’s express assertion that an arbitration agreement exists. Section 2A(6) must therefore require a denial with an identical degree of specificity from all three hypothetical respondents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Section 2A(6) cannot require the first hypothetical respondent to issue a general denial of the parties’ contract. That is simply because the first hypothetical respondent has no contract with the claimant to deny generally. Section 2A(6) must of necessity require the first hypothetical respondent to deny specifically the claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement. So too, s 2A(6) cannot require the second hypothetical respondent to issue a general denial of the parties’ contract. That is because the parties’ contract <span class="font-italic">ex hypothe</span><span class="font-italic">si</span> cannot have any rational connection to the existence of an arbitration agreement. Section 2A(6) must equally of necessity require the second hypothetical respondent to deny specifically the claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement. The third hypothetical respondent cannot be in a better position as regards the required specificity of its denial than the first and second hypothetical respondents. Section 2A(6) must therefore also require the third hypothetical respondent to deny specifically the claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In that sense, the parties’ historical conduct underlying their dispute is irrelevant for the purposes of s 2A(6). It is the claimant’s <span class="font-italic">present</span> assertion of an arbitration agreement which must be denied, not the existence of a putative arbitration agreement in the <span class="font-italic">past</span>. If a respondent fails to deny <span class="font-italic">now</span> the claimant’s assertion <span class="font-italic">now</span> of an arbitration agreement when the assertion calls for a reply, s 2A(6) will achieve its twin purposes by deeming there <span class="font-italic">now</span> to be an effective arbitration agreement between the parties. This deemed arbitration agreement does not arise from a past contract but from the parties’ present conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Where a claimant asserts that an arbitration agreement exists in the course of an arbitration (as opposed to other legal proceedings), there is undoubtedly an element of circularity to the introductory words of s 2A(6). The claimant’s assertion cannot in reality be made “in…arbitral… proceedings” if there is no arbitration agreement between the parties within the meaning of s 2A(1) and if s 2A(6) has not yet operated to deem the asserted arbitration agreement to be effective. But I consider that s 2A(6) intended this circularity to be resolved pragmatically. An assertion that an arbitration agreement exists is an assertion made “in any arbitral…proceedings” within the meaning of s 2A(6) if the assertion is made on an occasion which has the potential to engage either or both of the twin purposes of s 2A(6). So too, an assertion “calls for a reply” within the meaning of s 2A(6) if a failure to deny the assertion has the potential to engage those purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As I have already mentioned (see [53] above), Kennedys, on behalf of this applicant, asserted the existence of an arbitration agreement twice in the course of the arbitration. On my construction of s 2A(6), both assertions were made “in… arbitral…proceedings” and both called for a reply from the respondent. The respondent failed to deny both assertions. Therefore, s 2A(6) operated to deem the asserted arbitration agreement to be effective immediately upon the respondent’s failure. I now describe the two assertions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first assertion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Kennedys first asserted an arbitration agreement in July 2018.

If the final clause were missing entirely from the parties’ contract, Ms Choo’s general denial of the existence of the contract could not have sufficed to prevent s 2A(6) from operating.

The twin purposes of s 2A(6) of the Act were engaged, just as they were engaged when the respondent received the notice of arbitration. Additional stakeholders in the putative arbitration had begun to incur costs. These additional stakeholders are the SIAC, albeit not as the administering institution, and any arbitrator who might be approached to constitute the tribunal. The applicant’s assertion called for a specific denial. Otherwise, the procedure under s 8(2) of the Act would continue.

</div>
</div> This is not true in point of fact. Ms Choo never once in the course of the arbitration denied the existence of an arbitration agreement or connect her general denial of a contract to a specific denial of the claimant’s express assertion of an arbitration agreement. Ms Choo’s claim is also not to the point. What s 2A(6) required the respondent to do was to deny in 2018 the applicant’s assertions in 2018 that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties. Denying the existence of a contract which the parties entered into in 2017 does not suffice for this purpose. That is the case even if the general denial is read as encompassing a denial of the binding force of each individual clause in the contract and even if it is assumed that the final clause is a defective arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 2A(1) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 My holding on the operation of s 2A(6) of the Act makes it unnecessary for me to consider whether the final clause of the contract is in fact an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1) of the Act. But I must confess some doubt on this point. I say that for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, as the respondent quite rightly points out, the operative words – such as they are – of the final clause of the contract (see [13(b)] above) makes no reference to arbitration whatsoever. Those operative words provide only that Singapore law is to be the governing law of the contract.

</div> Choosing a governing law is obviously and fundamentally making a different choice from choosing arbitration as a dispute-resolution mechanism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, even if one has regard to the boldface heading of the clause and to the word “arbitration” which appears there, it would be very difficult legitimately to read into that single word by a process of contractual construction an obligation on the parties to submit to arbitration “all or certain disputes” under the contract as s 2A(1) requires. And even then, this approach would require lavishly interpreting the word “arbitration” in the heading as having operative effect rather than merely having a descriptive effect which was left unfulfilled when the parties failed to include the necessary operative words in the body of that clause. This construction would therefore to my mind be doubly strained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It may well be the case, therefore, that the respondent’s argument on s 2A(1) would have succeeded if the respondent had specifically denied the applicant’s assertion that an arbitration agreement existed between the parties in July 2018. But the respondent did not do that. Its argument on s 2A(1) of the Act has been overtaken by the operation of s 2A(6) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fraud and corruption immaterial to the operation of s 2A(6)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The respondent’s second argument on the first ground is that the contract is vitiated by fraud and corruption,

It would then have been necessary to analyse whether that arbitration agreement – even though separable – is vitiated by the alleged fraud or corruption which is said to vitiate the remainder of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I have instead held that the claimant’s argument under s 2A(6) of the Act succeeds. In my view, any fraud or corruption in the formation of the parties’ contract is incapable of having any effect on the operation of the arbitration agreement which is deemed effective by s 2A(6) of the Act. The effect of s 2A(6) is not to reach into the past to cure or validate the defect in the drafting of the final clause of the parties’ contract and to deem that clause henceforth be effective as an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1). As I have pointed out, s 2A(6) operates whether or not there is a contract between the parties, let alone whether or not there is a defective arbitration agreement in their contract. Section 2A(6) operates in the present, when the assertion of an arbitration agreement and the failure to deny take place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The arbitration and the award are therefore not founded on the final clause of the contract which the parties entered into in December 2017. Instead, the arbitration and the award are founded on an arbitration agreement between the parties which s 2A(6) deemed to be effective by reason only of the parties’ communications in July and August 2018 (see [69]–[79] above). It has therefore operated in this case without any connection to the parties’ contract and therefore untainted by any fraud or corruption which may vitiate that contract. Further, there is no allegation that there is any factor which vitiates the parties’ communications in July and August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Therefore, even if I were to find that the contract was vitiated by fraud and corruption which took place in 2017, and even if I were to find that the final clause of the contract (assumed to be and analysed as a separable arbitration agreement) was also vitiated by the same fraud and corruption, the arbitration agreement which s 2A(6) deemed to be effective in 2018 would remain entirely untainted by any such fraud or corruption and would stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the first ground</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I have rejected the respondent’s first ground for resisting enforcement of the award because I have concluded that s 2A(6) of the Act deems there to be an effective arbitration agreement between the parties from July 2018 at the earliest and August 2018 at the latest. I have also held that it is irrelevant to that conclusion that: (a) the final clause of the contract may not be an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1); and (b) the final clause may be vitiated by fraud and corruption in December 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The result is that the respondent is bound to arbitrate its substantive dispute with the applicant by the operation of s 2A(6) even if it is assumed that: (a) the respondent has never consented to arbitration, whether in the subjective sense or even in the objective contractual sense; and (b) the contract is tainted by fraud or corruption. That is undoubtedly an inroad on the consensual nature of arbitration. That is an especially serious inroad given that the allegations of fraud and corruption are made directly against the applicant and not just against Mr Saiful. An observer could justifiably take the view that the approach I have taken to s 2A(6) must be wrong because it demonstrates nothing so much as the proposition that fraud unravels everything except arbitration agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I do not think that view would be correct. I consider the inroad on the consensual nature of arbitration created by my approach to s 2A(6) to be a justified inroad in terms of policy and a moderate inroad in terms of effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I consider the inroad justified in terms of policy because of the twin purposes of s 2A(6) of the Act (see [58] above). To advance those twin purposes, s 2A(6) does nothing more than to provide that a respondent who fails to deny a claimant’s assertion of an arbitration agreement in the circumstances envisaged by s 2A(6) is precluded permanently from denying the arbitration agreement and from having recourse to litigation. Seen in that light, s 2A(6) merely establishes a statutory waiver or estoppel which binds the respondent. Whether it is correctly analysed as a waiver or an estoppel is immaterial for present purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I consider this inroad to be a moderate inroad because it relates only to the mode of dispute resolution. Section 2A(6) says nothing about the parties’ substantive rights and obligations. Thus, the respondent remained entirely at liberty in the arbitration to argue that there was fraud and corruption in the formation of the contract. In that sense, s 2A(6) is merely the mirror image of the rule in s 6 of the Act that delivering a pleading or taking a step in litigation extinguishes permanently a defendant’s right to have recourse to arbitration even if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties within the meaning of s 2A(1). Both provisions affect only the mode of dispute resolution and not its outcome. It is true that the operation of s 2A(6) does, at least in an arbitration governed by the Act, deprive a respondent of a right of an appeal against the outcome on the merits. But a respondent which finds itself bound by s 2A(6) has only itself to blame for its predicament.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I therefore reject the respondent’s first ground for resisting enforcement of the award. For the reasons I have given, I rest this conclusion on the operation of s 2A(6) of the Act alone. It is therefore not necessary for me to decide: (a) whether the final clause of the contract is an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1) of the Act; (b) if so, whether the contract is vitiated by fraud or corruption; and (c) if so, whether the final clause of the contract, treated as a separable arbitration agreement, is likewise vitiated by fraud or corruption. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The respondent was able to present its case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The respondent’s second ground for resisting enforcement of the award is that it was unable to present its case in the arbitration within the meaning of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. For this ground, the respondent relies only on the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only.

The two provisions contain the identical words: “was otherwise unable to present his case”. The test under both provisions must therefore be the same and ought properly to be approached in the same way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The proper approach on this ground is to ask whether the tribunal’s conduct of the arbitration falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. This enquiry will necessarily be fact-specific (see <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”) at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 This ground is related directly to the tribunal’s obligation under Art 18 of the Model Law to give each party a “full opportunity” to present its case in the arbitration. An award issued by a tribunal which has complied with its duty under Art 18 will not be susceptible to attack under either Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) or Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law by reason only of an alleged deficiency in the tribunal’s conduct of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Despite the use of the unqualified modifier “full” in Art 18, the obligation of a tribunal under this article to allow each party an opportunity to present its case is not without limit. A tribunal is obliged only to give each party a <span class="font-italic">reasonable </span>opportunity<span class="font-italic"> </span>to present its case (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [97(a)]; see also <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries L</span><span class="font-italic">td v Agritrade International Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 768 at [145]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 To succeed on its second ground, therefore, the respondent must satisfy me that the arbitrator failed to afford the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its case in the arbitration by conduct which falls outside the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in the circumstances of this case might have done.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two senses of the respondent’s argument</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 There are two senses in which to understand the respondent’s submission that it was unable to present its case in the arbitration. First, it could be understood in the sense that the arbitrator did not give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its case against the arbitrator’s <span class="font-italic">procedural</span> <span class="font-italic">decision</span> on 4 January 2019 to proceed documents-only. Second, it could be understood in the sense that the arbitrator did not give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its case on the merits of the parties’ <span class="font-italic">substantive dispute</span> in the arbitration simply because she decided to proceed documents-only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In oral submission, counsel for the respondent at times advanced the argument in the first sense and at other times disclaimed any intention to do so.

</div> That appears to me to be an attack on the decision-making process which led the arbitrator to decide to proceed documents-only, both in terms of the procedural justice she accorded to the parties before making her decision and in terms of the considerations which she took into account or failed to take into account in doing so.

</div> That is of course correct, subject only to what I say at [143]–[149] below. The respondent must then accept that the mere fact that the arbitrator proceeded documents-only cannot, in and of itself, mean that she breached her duty to give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its case within the meaning of Art 18. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The heart of the respondent’s submission on the second ground is that the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only on the facts of this case and in particular in light of Ms Choo’s 23 November 2018 email failed to give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its case. Thus, on the respondent’s case, it is the arbitrator’s decision on 4 January 2019 (see [111] above) to proceed documents-only which is the root cause of the respondent being unable to present its case. But the respondent cannot now claim to have been unable to present its case in the arbitration by reason of a procedural decision which was within the arbitrator’s jurisdiction and within her power unless that procedural decision itself is subject to a procedural defect, such as a failure to accord natural justice to a party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I therefore examine the respondent’s argument in both the senses I have identified (see [126] above).

</div> and (b) that Ms Choo is not trained in the law. I consider first the position disregarding these two personal characteristics of Ms Choo. I then consider the position taking these two characteristics into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I have no doubt that the arbitrator dealt with the issue of whether to proceed documents-only well within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in these circumstances might have done. I rely on three points which I extract from the chronology in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 First, Ms Choo knew that whether the arbitrator should proceed documents-only was a live issue from 9 October 2018. Kennedys first proposed a documents-only arbitration in its email to the arbitrator on 9 October 2018 (see [97] above). That proposal was copied to Ms Choo by email and by way of a physical copy delivered to the respondent’s registered address (see [98] above). Ms Choo replied to this email on 23 November 2018 (see [102] above). There is no suggestion, either in that email or in her evidence for this application, that Ms Choo did not receive the applicant’s proposal to proceed documents-only on or about 9 October 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Second, the arbitrator proceeded cautiously on the applicant’s proposal to proceed documents-only. The arbitrator did not direct a documents-only arbitration as soon as Kennedys proposed it on 9 October 2018. Instead, the arbitrator invited the parties to discuss between themselves after the close of pleadings the applicant’s proposal to see if they could agree a position (see [100] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Third, even when the applicant revived its proposal to proceed documents-only on 21 December 2018, the arbitrator gave the respondent an opportunity to be heard on it. Ms Choo was aware that Kennedys repeated the proposal to proceed documents-only on 21 December 2018, after pleadings had closed (see [108] above). On 26 December 2018, the arbitrator allowed Ms Choo nine days to respond to the request (see [109] above).This gave the respondent a total of 13 days from Kennedys’ email of 21 December 2018 to consider the proposal. Ms Choo acknowledged her opportunity to be heard (see [110] above). But she failed to take the opportunity. It was only after Ms Choo failed to reply within the arbitrator’s deadline that the arbitrator finally took the decision to proceed documents-only on 4 January 2019 (see [111] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 These three points taken together establish that the arbitrator afforded the respondent more than a reasonable opportunity to present its case on whether to proceed documents-only. This argument therefore fails as an argument for resisting enforcement of the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Does it matter that I have accepted that it would have been obvious to the arbitrator from 23 November 2018 at the latest that Ms Choo’s command of English is poor and that she is not trained in the law? In my view it does not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The fact remains that Ms Choo at no time expressed any confusion or misapprehension about the applicant’s proposal to proceed documents-only, whether when the proposal was first made on 9 October 2018 (see [97] above) or when it was repeated on 21 December 2018 (see [108] above). Likewise, she expressed no confusion or misapprehension about the proposal when the arbitrator expressly invited her to comment on it on 26 December 2018 (see [109] above). Quite the contrary: Ms Choo replied to the arbitrator’s invitation affirmatively to say that she would read Kennedys’ proposal “properly” and “understand it accordingly” (see [110] above).

</div>
</div> Having presumably read and understood the proposal as foreshadowed, Ms Choo did not communicate any confusion or misapprehension to the arbitrator about its substance. She did not do so even when the arbitrator decided to proceed documents-only on 4 January 2019 (see [111] above). In particular, Ms Choo never once: (a) told the arbitrator that she did not understand the significance of proceeding documents-only; (b) ask the arbitrator to explain that term to her; or (c) told the arbitrator that she was waiting for a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing to present and test the parties’ factual evidence. Ms Choo’s confusion and misapprehension was entirely self-engendered and uncommunicated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 There was therefore no reason for the arbitrator: (a) to appreciate that Ms Choo was operating under any confusion or misapprehension as to what a documents-only arbitration would entail; (b) to believe that Ms Choo was waiting for a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing; or (c) to think that the arbitrator should meet the parties in person in order to explain to Ms Choo how a documents-only arbitration would work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 There is accordingly no procedural defect in the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No breach in proceeding documents-only </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 My finding that the respondent was given a reasonable opportunity to present its case on the decision whether to proceed documents-only leaves no room for the respondent to succeed on the second sense of this argument, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the sense that the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only left the respondent unable to present its case in the arbitration generally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I begin by accepting that the breadth of a tribunal’s procedural power to conduct an arbitration documents-only under Art 19 of the Model Law is subject expressly to the parties’ agreement and to any mandatory provision of the <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The parties have no agreement requiring a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing within the meaning of Art 19 of the Model Law. Many institutions have rules which oblige a tribunal to hold a hearing. For example, Rule 24.1 of the SIAC Rules (6th Edition, 1 August 2016) (“the SIAC Rules”) obliges the tribunal to hold a hearing unless the parties have agreed to a documents-only arbitration:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless the parties have agreed on a documents-only arbitration or as otherwise provided in these Rules, the Tribunal shall, if either party so requests or the Tribunal so decides, hold a hearing for the presentation of evidence and/or for oral submissions on the merits of the dispute, including any issue as to jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Rule 24.1 provides, in effect, that either party may veto a proposal to conduct an arbitration documents-only, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without a hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The SIAC Rules do not apply to the parties’ arbitration. I have held that the arbitration was founded on an arbitration agreement between the parties deemed to be effective under s 2A(6) of the Act. An arbitration founded on s 2A(6) is necessarily an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> arbitration, not an institutional arbitration. And even if the parties did have an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s 2A(1), they did not agree that the SIAC was to administer the arbitration. Neither did they agree to adopt the SIAC Rules in any such arbitration agreement or by an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Singapore’s <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> is to the same effect as Rule 24.1 of the SIAC Rules. Art 24(1) of the Model Law provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 24. Hearings and written proceedings</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Subject to any contrary agreement by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, or whether the proceedings shall be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials. However, unless the parties have agreed that no hearings shall be held, the arbitral tribunal shall hold such hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by a party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Like Rule 24.1 of the SIAC Rules, the effect of Art 24(1) is that a party which requires a <span class="font-italic">viva voce </span>hearing may veto any proposal to conduct an arbitration documents-only. To exercise this veto, however, the objecting party must <span class="font-italic">both</span>: (a) not agree “that no hearings shall be held”; <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) positively make a request for a hearing to be held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Article 24(1) of the Model Law does not assist the respondent. The most that can be said is that the respondent did not agree to the applicant’s proposal that no hearings be held. And even that would be correct only if one assumes that the respondent’s silence following Ms Choo’s holding response to the arbitrator on 27 December 2018 (see [110] above) does not amount to implied consent to proceeding  documents-only. The fact remains, however, that at no time did the respondent positively request a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing. So, even though Art 24(1) of the Model Law gave the respondent a right to compel the arbitrator to hold a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing despite the applicant’s proposal to proceed documents-only and the tribunal’s inclination to accede, the respondent failed to exercise that right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 There was therefore nothing on the facts of this case which removed the arbitrator’s procedural discretion under Art 19 of the Model Law to proceed documents-only, whether in the parties’ arbitration agreement or under the<span class="font-italic"> lex arbitri</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In whichever of the two senses the respondent’s submission on this ground is understood (see [126] above), it amounts to arguing that the arbitrator had an obligation to deduce Ms Choo’s confusion or misapprehension about what a documents-only arbitration entailed and an obligation to divine that Ms Choo was waiting for a hearing at which the respondent could present and test the factual evidence <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span>.

</div> And the arbitrator was apparently obliged to do all of this even though Ms Choo’s confusion and misapprehension was entirely self-engendered and was never once communicated to the arbitrator in any of Ms Choo’s several communications with her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 If the respondent’s submission is correct, a tribunal’s failure to discharge these obligations would be grounds for both refusing to enforce an award and also for setting it aside.

</div> That is particularly so for a dispute which arises from the trade in a commodity such as gas oil.

However, for completeness, I make some further observations on this ground, assuming – in the respondent’s favour and contrary to my finding – that the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only did in fact render the respondent unable to present its case within the meaning of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 A party which establishes that it was unable to present its case in an arbitration will not succeed in resisting enforcement of an award for that reason alone.

</div> Mr Saiful has now admitted that he procured the contract through fraud and corruption without the respondent’s knowledge (see paragraph [35] above). If the respondent had been able to adduce Mr Saiful’s evidence in the arbitration, and had been able to cross-examine the applicant’s factual witnesses, it could have proven the fraud and corruption and established that the contract was thereby vitiated. Therefore, by proceeding documents-only the arbitrator failed properly to canvass the merits of the parties’ dispute in the arbitration and her award. If she had done so, the outcome of the arbitration could have been different.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I reject this argument for four reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 First, the arbitrator’s decision on 4 January 2019 to proceed documents-only did not prevent the parties from adducing in the arbitration the evidence of any witness. It affected only whether the party could adduce the evidence <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> or in documentary form. As far as Mr Taufik’s and Mr Ong’s evidence is concerned, there is no suggestion that their evidence was not available to the respondent during the evidential phase in the arbitration, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, between December 2018 and January 2019. The arbitration concluded without these two witnesses’ evidence because Ms Choo failed to make any attempt to secure their evidence and to place it before the arbitrator in any form. As for Mr Saiful’s evidence, Ms Choo’s loss of contact with Mr Saiful from June 2018 to July 2019 is not a risk which the respondent can cast upon the applicant at the enforcement stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Second, the arbitrator directed that the arbitration proceed documents-only by paragraph 4(a) of her procedural direction issued on 4 January 2019 (see [111] above). Paragraph 4(c) of the same procedural direction gave the parties a final opportunity to adduce factual witness evidence, provided they did so by 18 January 2019. The respondent therefore had the opportunity to adduce the evidence of any witness in documentary form right up until 18 January 2019. Further, a procedural direction carries no finality under the Act or the Model Law. The respondent also had the opportunity to ask the arbitrator to reconsider her decision not to receive evidence <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> up until 18 January 2019. The respondent did not take advantage of either of these opportunities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Third, I do not consider that the decision to proceed documents-only shortened the duration of the arbitration so as to have the effect of excluding Mr Saiful’s evidence. Even if it is assumed that this arbitration would have taken four months longer to conclude if the arbitrator had held a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing than it did as a documents-only arbitration – an assumption which I consider to be reasonable in all the circumstances – that <span class="font-italic">viva voce </span>arbitration would have concluded with an award issued on 1 June 2019 instead of 1 February 2019. It was not until a month later, in July 2019, that the respondent re-established contact with Mr Saiful. Mr Saiful’s evidence would still not have been available if this arbitration had proceeded <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Finally, as for the allegation that the respondent suffered prejudice by not being able to cross-examine the applicant’s witnesses,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-99f1741d-5205-4376-9b03-cee1ac554340" data-toggle="modal" type="button">143</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> this allegation is so general and speculative as to be a non-starter. In any event, the applicant elected to call no factual witnesses at all in the arbitration. This is recorded in paragraph 2(c) of the arbitrator’s procedural direction issued on 4 January 2019 (see [111] above). The respondent cannot complain that it suffered prejudice by being deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine the applicant’s witnesses if the applicant had no intention of calling any.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 It follows that the arbitrator’s decision to proceed documents-only caused no prejudice to the respondent, even if it is assumed that that decision in some technical sense left the respondent unable to present its case in the arbitration. The root cause of any prejudice which the respondent suffered in this arbitration is Ms Choo’s confusion and misapprehension about the effect of proceeding documents-only. If that caused the respondent to wait in vain for a <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> hearing that was never going to take place, that is not a risk which the respondent can cast upon the applicant at the enforcement stage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Enforcement is not contrary to public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The respondent’s third ground for resisting enforcement of the award is that enforcing the award would be contrary to Singapore’s public policy within the meaning of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. Article 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) is the analogue of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii), which allows a Singapore court to set an award aside if it “is in conflict with the public policy” of Singapore. Although the two provisions are not worded identically, I take the substance of the test in the two provisions to be the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The respondent submits that I should refuse to enforce the award because it is tainted by Mr Saiful’s conspiracy with the applicant to defraud the respondent by offering corrupt gratifications to Mr Taufik and Mr Ong to procure the contract (see [35] above).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 The respondent’s argument on this ground is not that a mere allegation of fraud and corruption suffices to succeed in resisting enforcement under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii). Its argument invites me to find as a fact on the balance of probabilities on the evidence before me in this application that there actually was fraud and corruption in the formation of the contract.

I prefer to deal with the respondent’s third ground on the assumption that the facts set out in Mr Saiful’s WeChat messages and affidavit are true (see [35] above). I therefore assume – taking the respondent’s case at its highest and without deciding the issue – that the contract was procured by fraud and corruption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The respondent’s argument is that the scope of Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) is not confined to an issue of Singapore’s public policy which arises from the conduct of the arbitration or from the contents of the award. The respondent does not suggest, quite rightly, that there is anything about the arbitration or the award which can on any view be considered to be contrary to any aspect of Singapore’s public policy. The respondent’s argument is that an award may be refused enforcement under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) if an issue of Singapore’s public policy arises from the parties’ dispute <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the arbitration and the award are completely consistent with Singapore’s public policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Applied to the facts of this case, the respondent’s argument is that the fraud or corruption which I have assumed to exist in the formation of the parties’ contract <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> itself</span> suffices to justify refusing enforcement of the award under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I reject this argument for three reasons.

</div> <span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore </span>does not assist the respondent, even indirectly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 It is not surprising that the respondent can find no authority for this argument. The conditions in which this argument can even be made, let alone succeed, are very narrow. Thus, for example, it is very unlikely that a public policy issue which arises from the parties’ dispute would remain alive to be raised at the enforcement stage where a Singapore court is asked to enforce an award arising out of an arbitration conducted with Singapore law as its <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> in which a Singapore-seated tribunal has resolved the parties’ dispute by applying Singapore law. That is for the simple reason that any issue of Singapore’s public policy arising from the parties’ dispute will be an issue which is accommodated within the principles of Singapore’s substantive law or its <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> and which will ordinarily be raised and resolved in the arbitration itself. That would generally preclude the party resisting enforcement from raising the issue again at the enforcement stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 An issue of Singapore public policy arising from the parties’ dispute could remain or become a live issue at the enforcement stage primarily in two situations. One is where the party resisting enforcement was unaware of the facts giving rise to the issue at the time of the arbitration and therefore could not have raised it in the arbitration. An example would be a party who is completely unaware that a contract was procured by fraud or corruption until after a tribunal has issued its award against it. The second is where the parties’ dispute is resolved under a substantive law <span class="font-italic">other than</span> Singapore law or where the award is issued under a <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> other than Singapore’s <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span>. An example would be where the subject-matter of the parties’ dispute is arbitrable under a foreign <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> but is not arbitrable under Singapore’s <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span>. Even then, in both situations, the public policy issue which remains alive would have to come within the very narrow confines within which the public policy ground is allowed to operate (see <span class="font-italic">PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank </span><span class="font-italic">SA</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In these relatively rare circumstances, it is possible that an arbitration and an award may be completely consistent with Singapore’s public policy but there remains alive at the enforcement stage an issue of Singapore’s public policy arising from the parties’ dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 This is not such a case. It falls into neither of the two situations I have posited. It is therefore not surprising that the respondent is unable to find authority to support its argument in a case such as this one. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Finality of awards</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The respondent’s argument on Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) undermines the finality which s 19B of the Act confers on awards. There is no countervailing justification for doing so where the party resisting enforcement had the opportunity to place the issue of Singapore’s public policy before the arbitrator to be resolved in the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 That is precisely what happened here.

I do not accept the applicant’s submission to the extent that it is a submission that the award raises a cause of action estoppel which precludes the respondent from raising the issue of fraud and corruption now. It is true that the arbitrator found in the award that the parties entered into a valid and binding contract. But that finding must be read against the pleadings in the arbitration. For the reasons I have given, those pleadings did not place the issue of fraud and corruption in the contract before the arbitrator for determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Having said that, I accept that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> operates on the facts of this case to much the same effect as cause of action estoppel. <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">es judicata </span>is a collective term for three distinct but interrelated principles: (a) cause of action estoppel; (b) issue estoppel; and (c) the “extended” doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>or the defence of “abuse of process” (<span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [98], citing <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span>”) at [17]–[25]). This third principle is also known as the principle<span class="font-italic"> </span>in<span class="font-italic"> Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The first two of these three interrelated principles apply where an issue has previously been determined as between the same parties. The third principle, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applies where an issue has not been raised previously for determination as between the parties but ought to have been raised (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others </span>[2018] SGHC 130 at [26] and [32]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 I have found that the respondent expressly declined to place the issue of fraud or corruption in the formation of the contract before the arbitrator for determination in the arbitration. The applicant and the arbitrator therefore did not have to deal with the issue and did not in fact deal with the issue. On the facts of this case, therefore, only the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> can apply. This requires the court to examine whether, having regard to the substance and reality of the earlier proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the arbitration), the issue in question (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether there was fraud and corruption in the formation of the contract) ought reasonably to have been raised in those earlier proceedings rather than in the later proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, this application) (see <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The respondent’s failure to place this issue before the arbitrator suffices to bring the issue within the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. The respondent is precluded from raising the issue of fraud or corruption in the formation of the contract on this application as a ground for refusing enforcement of the award in much the same way as a cause of action estoppel would preclude it from doing so. I therefore agree with the applicant that the respondent cannot now raise this issue as a ground for refusing enforcement, albeit for a different reason than that advanced by the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The respondent, having declined to put the issue of fraud and corruption in the formation of the contract before the arbitrator in the arbitration, cannot now seek to put the issue before me on this application in order to resist enforcement on the public policy ground. Any other approach would undermine the finality which s 19B of the Act confers on the award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Minimal curial intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The respondent’s argument on Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) also undermines the principle of minimal curial intervention. The principle is enacted in Art 5 of the Model Law and is a mainstay of Singapore’s law of arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The public policy ground in Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) – and by extension also in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) – cannot be interpreted so widely that it can routinely be invoked on an enforcement or setting-aside application by a public policy issue arising from the parties’ dispute, as opposed to a public policy issue arising from the arbitration or the award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Where a party could have raised the public policy issue before the tribunal – or, even worse, did raise it before the tribunal but lost on it – allowing that party to raise the public policy issue again under Art 36(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) or under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) would amount <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> to creating a new ground for nullifying an award, in addition to the specific grounds enumerated in Art 36 of the Model Law. That is prohibited by Art 5 of the Model Law and the principle of minimal curial intervention. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the respondent has failed on each of the three grounds it has advanced to resist enforcement of the award. I have therefore dismissed with costs the respondent’s application to set aside the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order granting the applicant leave to enforce the award.
