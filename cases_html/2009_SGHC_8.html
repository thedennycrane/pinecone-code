<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1       The plaintiff company, Thomson Development Co (Pte) Ltd claimed that the defendant, Ng Kah Jin, a former shareholder and director of the company and the registered owner of six properties at Cavan Road, Singapore (“the properties”), held the properties on trust for the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that there was an express agreement that the defendant would hold the properties on trust for the plaintiff, or alternatively that there was a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff.</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 1]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The reliance on a resulting trust appeared to be an afterthought. When the plaintiff filed a caveat on the properties on 26 June 2007 to claim beneficial ownership of the properties, the claim was based on an alleged agreement between itself and the defendant, with no reference to any resulting trust.</font><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 2]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2       The dispute is as much a family matter as it is a company matter. The family involved is the Lin (also spelt as Ling and Lim) family. The dominant member of the company is Lin Kok Cheng (“LKC”), acknowledged to be the driving force and controlling mind of the company.</font><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 3]</font></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3       The defendant is the widow of LKC’s brother, Ling Kok Ka or Vincent Ling (“VLKK”). VLKK was the company secretary and manager of the plaintiff company up to the time of his death. There is a third brother, Lim Kok Kiong (“LKK”), a director and shareholder of the plaintiff. He admitted that he became a director and shareholder of the plaintiff as a nominee of LKC, and that he did not play an active role in the affairs of the plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4       LKC was the plaintiff’s principal witness. His evidence was that the company was run as a family business and was operated on the basis of mutual trust and confidence,</font><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 4]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and he nominated members of the family, including his wife, his daughter, his brothers and sister-in-law to be shareholders and directors of the plaintiff while he maintained control over the shares and the company.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5       In 1982, the plaintiff company exercised an option to purchase the properties from the owner. The purchases were completed in the names of the defendant and a co-investor, Low Hock Heng (“LHH”) because the plaintiff did not have the funds to purchase the properties on its own. The directors of the plaintiff passed a resolution for the properties to be transferred to the defendant and LHH upon completion. In 1984, LHH sold his half interest in the properties which was transferred to the defendant, who then became the sole registered owner of the property.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6       The plaintiff’s case was that there was an express agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant that the defendant would hold the properties on trust for the plaintiff, or alternatively, that there is a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff.</font><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 5]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The defendant denied that there was any express agreement.

VLKK, the second brother, was a bankrupt for a major part of his working life, and LKK was a draughtsman, whose heath problems restricted his capacity for work.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9       LKC’s evidence was that he was too busy with his commitments as an architect and consultant in property developments to attend to the affairs of the plaintiff, and he left them to VLKK. He had also nominated, at different times, the defendant, his late wife Jenny Kang, LKK, his daughter Ling Lin Yun as shareholders and directors of the plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10     In keeping with the familial and informal approach to the matters, there was little documentation on the purchase of the properties. Counsel for the plaintiff confirmed that the plaintiff’s books and accounts do not record that it had any beneficial interest in the properties</font><a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 9]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">or any acknowledgment by the defendant that she was holding the properties in trust for the plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11     Although the plaintiff’s primary case was that there was an express agreement that the defendant was to hold the properties on trust for the plaintiff, no particulars of this agreement were disclosed. LKC did not refer to any such agreement. It is particularly significant that in the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter to the defendant dated 14 August 2007 to demand that she execute a declaration of trust in favour of the plaintiff,</font><a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 10]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">reference was made to payments the plaintiff made for the acquisition of the properties, but there was no mention of any express agreement between the parties. This was an unexplained departure from the position taken in the caveat filed on 26 June 2007, less than two months previously.</font></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13     The first trust deed was prepared in 2003. The background to the preparation of this trust deed was that LKC was diagnosed with prostrate cancer and myasthenia gravis, and was warded in hospital in November 2002. While he was in hospital, he was approached by his son-in-law for a $50,000 loan. When he raised this with VLKK, he was informed that the plaintiff did not have the funds to make the loan. This came as a surprise to him as he had believed that the plaintiff had substantial cash reserves.</font><a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 11]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">He was concerned that the defendant and VLKK would dissipate the assets of the plaintiff after he died.</font><a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 12]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">He decided to have a trust deed drawn up for the properties.

<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The conduct of the plaintiff company</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">34     There was nothing in the plaintiff’s records that indicated that it regarded itself to have a beneficial interest in the properties. It could have obtained an acknowledgment of the defendant that she held the properties as its trustee. This could have been done in 1982 when the half-share of the properties was acquired, or in 1984, when the full interest was obtained. There were no resolutions to reflect the beneficial interest of the company. The plaintiff’s accounts did not include any beneficial interest in the properties amongst its assets. This was despite LKC’s claim in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that:</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40.    In or about April 1991, Thomson (as the beneficial owner of the Properties) discharged all the outstanding loans with Sing Investments and freed the Properties from encumbrances. The Properties were then registered under the sole name of the Defendant to hold the same in trust for Thomson.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41.    Although the Properties were registered in the Defendant’s sole name, at all material times, the understanding was that the Defendant would hold all the Properties on trust for Thomson. This trust arrangement was not documented in writing at that time as parties’ relationship was based on mutual trust and confidence. Moreover, the Defendant, being a director of Thomson at that material time, had a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of the Properties, one of the company’s assets.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">If that was true, then the property would have been listed amongst the company’s assets in accordance with the understanding. The failure to list the properties contradicted LKC’s claim.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">35     Although the plaintiff was a family business operated on the goodwill and trust of the family members, the plaintiff’s beneficial interest in the properties should have been included in its accounts, especially if there was an express agreement as the plaintiff claimed. Counsel for the plaintiff stated that there was no record of it in the plaintiff’s records. Absent an express agreement, if it was recorded that payments were made for the acquisition of the properties for the benefit of the plaintiff, the interest acquired would be reflected in the plaintiff’s accounts, but it was not reflected.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The conduct of the plaintiff’s shareholders and directors</font></em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">36     The plaintiff’s case is that LKC was the driving force behind the plaintiff and LKC’s evidence was that he decided on the allocation of the plaintiff’s shares and the appointment of the plaintiff’s directors.</font></span></p>

He testified during cross-examination that he was not the owner of 10% of the properties, but was holding it on trust for LKC because “Kok Cheng is still the owner, and everything belongs to him”</font><a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times" size="3">[note: 33]</font></span></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(and not the plaintiff).</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">39     The plaintiff seeks a declaration that it is the beneficial owner of the properties. It put forth two reasons for its claim: firstly, that there was an express agreement that the defendant would hold the properties on trust for it, and secondly, that there was a resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff because the plaintiff paid for the acquisition of the properties.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">40     On the first ground, there was no serious effort by the plaintiff to prove its case. The express agreement alluded to was not identified in the pleadings, and LKC, the plaintiff’s controlling mind and principal witness, made no mention of any express agreement. It is telling that in the closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff was similarly silent. There was no evidence of any express agreement at all.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">41     The claim that the plaintiff is the beneficiary under a resulting trust was made long after the properties were purchased. Even when the plaintiff filed its caveat to give notice of its claim to beneficial interest on 26 April 2007, it based its claim on an alleged agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, not on any resulting trust.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">42     A resulting trust can arise when A pays for property that is purchased in the name of B. In such a situation, there is a rebuttable presumption that B will hold the property in trust for A.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">43     Was the claim nevertheless made out? There were substantial factors which went counter to the plaintiff’s claim. Firstly, the evidence was that the plaintiff did not pay the full purchase price for the properties. The plaintiff’s own evidence was that LKC’s architectural practice, AUG, provided $35,000 towards the deposit and a further sum of about $90,000 for buying out LHH’s share in the properties. Considering that the initial purchase price for the properties was $400,000, the $125,000 contribution from AUG was a significant flaw in the plaintiff’s case.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">44     There was another question – whether in the circumstances, it can be said that the plaintiff paid any part of the purchase price. The purchase price was raised from loans from OUF and SIF. The circumstances for the taking and repayment of the two loans differ. The first loan was taken in the names of the defendant and LHH, and the second loan was taken in the name of the defendant alone. The plaintiff’s case was that it repaid these loans.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">45     As far as the first loan was concerned, that was inconsistent with its own case that LHH was the legal and beneficial owner of his share of the properties. There was no reason for the plaintiff to repay his portion of the loan.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">46     The second loan was taken by the defendant alone. Is the repayment of the second loan similar to the provision of the purchase money? That would depend on the circumstances. If A repays B’s loan because B becomes unable to repay the loan after taking it on its own account, A cannot be regarded as having paid the purchase price. But if B was only the borrower in name, and the effective borrower and the repaying party was intended to be A, then A can be regarded as having paid the purchase price as it assumed responsibility for it from the outset.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">47     In this case, there was evidence was that the loan was taken on the initiative of the plaintiff, and the repayments were made by plaintiff. The repayments made can be treated as payments made by the plaintiff towards the purchase price.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">48     Secondly, there was no evidence that the plaintiff intended to acquire any interest in the properties. It never listed any interest in the properties in its records and accounts.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">49     Thirdly, all the persons connected with the plaintiff, its controlling mind LKC, shareholders and directors signed the trust deeds and the management agent agreement. If the trust deeds were executed by the defendant alone, they would be of limited value because the defendant cannot create any trust if she was not the beneficial owner. However, the execution of these documents by the various parties gave significance to the documents because that showed that they did not look upon the plaintiff as having any beneficial interest in the properties, and they were persons who were aware of and were interested in the affairs of the plaintiff.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">50     There was no resulting trust in favour of the plaintiff. The presumption for that was amply rebutted by the fact that on its best case, the plaintiff did not pay the whole purchase price for the properties, and that there was clear and uncontroversial evidence that it was not intended to have any beneficial interest in the properties.</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Conclusion</font></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">51     The plaintiff’s case on the basis of express agreement and on resulting trust was dismissed with costs.</font></span></p>
