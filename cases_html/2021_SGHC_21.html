One of the most common grounds raised by the aggrieved party is that it was denied a reasonable opportunity to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 A denial of a reasonable opportunity to be heard can occur in any number of ways, including the manner in which the arbitral tribunal conducted the arbitration proceedings. I term this as “procedural natural justice”. In matters pertaining to procedural natural justice in particular, the Court of Appeal very recently in <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695 (“<span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>”), emphasised the need for an aggrieved party to give fair intimation to the arbitral tribunal in “real time” if that party felt that a breach of procedural natural justice had occurred during the course of the arbitration proceedings. The Court of Appeal underscored the importance of making clear one’s objection as any equivocation may be equated to a party attempting to hedge its position. Any attempt by the aggrieved party to hedge its position would be frowned upon by the courts if that party subsequently sought to challenge the award on the ground of breach of natural justice occasioned by the tribunal (at [168], [170]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The application before me in HC/OS 1103/2019 (“OS 1103”) raises a number of interesting issues but at its core, it brings into sharp focus the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> and the extent of the duty to give fair intimation to the tribunal. As applications of this nature are highly fact sensitive, I begin with a detailed review of the background facts leading up to the making of the award in question. As is common in these applications, the parties agreed to a sealing order being made to preserve the confidentiality of the parties and the arbitral proceedings.

GC 40 in turn provided for an extension of time for Mechanical Completion and stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40.1 The Time for Completion specified in Article 5.1 of the Agreement shall be extended if [CAJ or CAK] shall be delayed or impeded in the performance of any of its obligations under the Contract by reason of any of the following: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) any act or omission of or any default or breach of the Contract by [B] or any activity, act or omission of any other contractors employed by [B] (excluding [CAJ or CAK]); or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">by such period as shall be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and as shall fairly reflect the delay or impediment sustained by [CAJ or CAK]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40.2 Except where otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in the Contract, [CAJ or CAK] shall submit to [B] a notice of a claim for an extension of the Time for Completion, together with particulars of the event or circumstance justifying such extension as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of such event or circumstance. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40.3 [CAJ or CAK] shall at all times use its reasonable efforts to minimize [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] any delay in the performance of its obligations under the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 GC 26.1 of the Agreements confirmed that Mechanical Completion need only be achieved within such extended time to which the defendants shall be entitled under GC 40. Article 5.3 read with GC 26.2 further cemented the position that liquidated damages would only start to accrue if Mechanical Completion was not achieved within this extended time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In essence, GC 40 allowed for the extension of time for Mechanical Completion and hence a reduction in the amount of liquidated damages payable upon any delay. The extension of time for Mechanical Completion was subject to three contractual conditions: (a) that the delay on CAJ’s or CAK’s part was attributable to B; (b) the submission of a notice of claim justifying the extension as soon as reasonably practicable; and (c) CAJ or CAK was to use its reasonable efforts to minimise any delay in the performance of their obligations.

The granting of the extension of time resulted in a corresponding reduction of 25 days’ worth of liquidated damages (amounting to 2.5% of the contract price) that were adjudged by the Tribunal to be payable by the defendants to the Arbitration Claimants. The Arbitration Claimants were hence granted only 74 days’ worth of liquidated damages by the Tribunal, instead of the 99 days’ worth of liquidated damages sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Although the contract prices were expressed in a number of different foreign currencies,

</div> the Plant included a H2 unit with six compressors. These compressors would sufficiently pressurise hydrogen before forcing it through a multi-stage purification apparatus that would allow the H2 unit to produce purified hydrogen gas for the production of polysilicon. On 25 January 2013, CAK informed the manufacturer of the compressor motors that the compressors were exhibiting abnormal and excessive vibrations (“Abnormal Vibrations”), far exceeding any levels of vibrations that were deemed safe by the International Organisation for Standardisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 For context, the Abnormal Vibrations were impermissible as they could damage the compressors and any connected systems, as well as render the Plant unsafe and/or inoperable, particularly given the highly combustible and explosive properties of hydrogen.

The Arbitration Claimants added that no such signed written waiver had ever been provided by them, nor would a waiver of such extensive scope have been authorised.

The procedural unfairness point is particularly acute with this final new claim, as the [defendants] attempt to put more and more emphasis on discussions or alleged agreements which have not been the subject of pleadings, focused document production, witness evidence or cross-examination</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">This includes the fact that not only were the [Arbitration] Claimants denied the opportunity in this regard, but also the fact that the [defendants] did not subject the [Arbitration] Claimants’ witnesses to any cross-examination to give them a chance to explain their positions (on the unpled issues). </span>This approach runs entirely contrary to the purpose of the detailed Procedural Orders. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98. In any event, this new GC 40 claim has three insurmountable flaws: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, the plain wording of GC 40.1 has not been satisfied: even on the [defendants’] case they have not been “<span class="font-italic">delayed or impeded in the performance of any of its obligations…</span>” There is no dispute that they failed to complete by the Time for Completion, and the events to which they refer arose both (a) only after the Time for Completion, and (b) as a direct consequence of the [defendants’] admitted breach of contract. GC 40 cannot have been intended to apply in these circumstances: its purpose was to avoid the application of the prevention principle prior to that point in time. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Second, the [defendants] have not complied with the mandatory pre-requisites for such an extension at GC 40.2, which are if anything even more explicit and extensive than those for GC 39, or identified nay mutual agreement by which these have been waived.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, as has been addressed above, there is no evidence upon which the Tribunal can properly find there was any delay to which the clause could apply. Even if there were, GC 40.1 only permits an Extension of Time ‘<span class="font-italic">by such period as shall be fair and reasonable</span>’. By the time of the events relied upon by the [defendants], it was already inevitable that they would be liable to pay Liquidated Damages to the [Arbitration] Claimants, and GC 40 could not ‘<span class="font-italic">fairly’</span> or ‘<span class="font-italic">reasonably</span>’ operate so as to the defeat the claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in underline and italics in original; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The paragraphs quoted above also feature centrally in OS 1103 and I consider them later in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Further correspondence was subsequently exchanged between the parties and the Tribunal (see below at [139]) on other matters that did not involve the EOT Defence.

GC 3.9 required several prerequisites to be fulfilled before any waiver of the Agreements could have contractual effect and it was common ground that none of these prerequisites had been completed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290.  However, the Tribunal regards the [defendants’] ‘new’ argument as being perfectly capable of consideration by the Tribunal because:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) the [Arbitration] Claimants’ written closing submissions were prepared and filed in response to the [defendants’] written closing submissions; and </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) the [Arbitration] Claimants have therefore had an opportunity to make submissions in response to the [defendants’] argument (to which the [defendants] did not have a right of reply). In the premises, the [defendants] are therefore entitled to make use the evidence which had already existed in this arbitration (at the time of their written closing submissions) in their attempt to make good this line of argument.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Tribunal thus went on to consider the substance of the EOT Defence. The Tribunal found that while the defendants had caused Mechanical Completion to be delayed by 99 days (after factoring in the 14-day grace period), it was “fair and reasonable”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(using the language of GC 40) to extend time by a period of 25 days. Consequently, the Arbitration Claimants were only entitled to receive liquidated damages for 74 days (Award at paragraph 269), <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> 99 days less an extension of time of 25 days. In connection with this, the Tribunal made five key findings and/or observations germane to OS 1103:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it was common ground between the parties that the defendants had not complied with the notice provisions under GC 40.2 and that the Arbitration Claimants had never formally granted an EOT to CAK under the Onshore Agreement (Award at paragraph 285);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) compliance with the notice provisions in GC 40.2 was not a condition precedent for the <span class="font-italic">Tribunal </span>to grant an EOT to the defendants pursuant to GC 40.1 (Award at paragraphs 286, 292, 304–306);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Tribunal had a “wide discretion in determining the length of any EOT granted under [GC 40.1]” as the provision provides that any EOT must fairly and reasonably “in all the circumstances” reflect the delay or impediment suffered by CAK (Award at paragraph 312); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) if there had been no Piecemeal Rectification Works, CAK would have fixed the Vibration Issue more promptly than the actual time taken for the permanent countermeasures to be implemented, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>via concurrent rectification works on all six compressors simultaneously (Award at paragraphs 314–316); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the defendants had carried out Piecemeal Rectification Works upon the Admitted Instruction. The piecemeal nature of the works was to the “direct advantage” of B who would otherwise have had to wait to commence the commissioning of the Plant. This also compromised the defendants’ ability to use their concerted efforts to fix the Abnormal Vibrations (Award at paragraphs 314–324, in particular paragraph 322).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Tribunal acknowledged that detailed evidence concerning how CAK would have gone about rectifying the Abnormal Vibrations but for the Piecemeal Rectification Schedule, was not before it (Award at paragraphs 313, 333 and 335). It accepted that there was no precise expert or factual evidence establishing the difference in time for rectification but found that such evidence would have only amounted to circumstantial evidence of CAK’s intention in the early months of 2013. The Tribunal did not think that this evidence would have been of much assistance as it would still have to form its own view on the extent to which B’s actions increased the time taken for the rectification of the Vibration Issue (Award at paragraph 314).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Even though there was “no direct evidence” before it “establishing how long permanent counter-measures would have taken to be implemented, absent B’s involvement in the issue”, the Tribunal saw itself as being capable of fairly and reasonably determining a time period which reflected the delay or impediment suffered by CAK, as required under GC 40.1 (Award at paragraph 327). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Tribunal then concluded that taking into account “all the evidence <span class="font-italic">and its experience in these matters</span>” [emphasis added], a 25-day extension of time would be an appropriate EOT to grant to CAK, to reflect the delay occasioned by B by its insistence that rectification works be carried out on a piecemeal basis (Award at paragraph 334). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, in the Tribunal’s view, the period of 25 days reflected the Arbitration Claimants’ own culpability, which the Tribunal assessed at “around 25%”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On 29 August 2019, CAI filed OS 1103.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 CAI seeks to set aside the Award on two main grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the first ground, CAI argues that the Award is tainted by two breaches of natural justice:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, the Tribunal allowed and ruled on the EOT Defence without giving the Arbitration Claimants a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond, despite recognising that such evidence and submissions would have made a difference to its determination of the matter (“Primary NJ Breach”);

As prefaced at [2] above, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) had occasion to add to the existing jurisprudence by restating and clarifying a number of principles governing s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An applicant seeking to set aside an arbitral award for breach of natural justice must establish: (i) which rule of natural justice was breached; (ii) how it was breached; (iii) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (iv) how the breach did or could have prejudiced its rights (at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The right to be heard, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> a party’s right to present its case and to respond to the case against it, is a fundamental rule of natural justice (at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The threshold for finding a breach of natural justice is a high one and will only be crossed in exceptional cases. Setting aside is permitted on this basis when the procedural protections in Art 18 of the Model Law have not been duly accorded to the award-debtor (at [87], [89], [104(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Article 18 of the Model Law provides that “[t]he parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity of presenting its case”. The word “full” was not intended to create a right of unlimited scope, but rather a right that is impliedly limited by considerations of reasonableness and fairness (at [96]–[97], [104(b])). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) What constitutes a “full opportunity” is a contextual inquiry that can only be meaningfully answered within the specific context of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. The overarching inquiry is whether the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was fair and the court ought to ask itself if what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done (at [98], [104(c)]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) In undertaking this exercise, the court must put itself in the shoes of the tribunal, particularly when the court is reviewing complaints by the aggrieved party of procedural unfairness on the tribunal’s part. This means that: (i) the tribunal’s decisions can only be assessed by reference to what was known to the tribunal at the time and it follows from this that the alleged breach of natural justice must have been brought to the attention of the tribunal at the material time; and (ii) the court will accord a margin of deference to the tribunal in matters of procedure.

I come to this conclusion for two key reasons. First, the EOT Defence was indisputably a completely new defence that was introduced at the tail end of the arbitral proceedings. As such, the Arbitration Claimants did not have the opportunity to adduce the relevant evidence and present submissions necessary to properly deal with it. Second, they could not, in my view, have predicted the appearance of the EOT Defence. Thus, when the Tribunal allowed and ruled on the EOT Defence in the Award, the Arbitration Claimants were, in my view, denied their right to be heard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The EOT Defence was a completely new defence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The EOT Defence was a completely new defence in two senses of the word “new”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The first sense of the word “new” is based on the question whether the EOT Defence had featured at any time during the course of the arbitral proceedings prior to the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. This must be answered in the negative. As stated above, the defendants concede that the EOT Defence had not been pleaded and appeared for the first time in the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. This was approximately a month <span class="font-italic">after </span>the evidentiary hearing had concluded, at the very tail end of the arbitral proceedings. Prior to this, there was no hint that the defendants would be relying on GC 40 to positively seek a contractual extension of time<span class="font-italic"> – </span>I return to this point later when dealing with the alleged invitation by the Tribunal at [120]–[122] below<span class="font-italic">. </span>As mentioned above at [40], the Arbitration Claimants had expressly pointed out in the Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim that the defendants were <span class="font-italic">not</span> seeking to rely on GC 40. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The second sense of the word “new” is based on the question whether the EOT Defence was so similar to the pleaded Estoppel Defence such that the Arbitration Claimants had a reasonable opportunity to present their case on the EOT Defence because it had sufficient notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to deal with the Estoppel Defence. I also answer this question in the negative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendants acknowledge that the EOT Defence is separate from the Estoppel Defence. However, their case is that the Arbitration Claimants had every opportunity to engage with the EOT Defence during the arbitration. This is because the facts and evidence relied upon <span class="font-italic">by the defendants</span> to support the Estoppel Defence were “the <span class="font-underline">exact</span> same facts and evidence that they then relied on in their written closing submissions to make the separate (but closely related) legal argument that they were entitled to an EOT” [emphasis in original].

What was in play in the Arbitration was only the Complete Estoppel Defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For clarity, I will hereafter no longer use the term “Estoppel Defence” as referring to partial and complete estoppel.

Specifically: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) GC 40.1 and GC 40.1(e) required proof that there was an “act”, “omission” or “any default or breach by [B]” that caused the defendants to “be delayed or impeded in the performance of any of [their] obligations under the [Agreements]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To receive an extension of time for completion, the defendants must show that the period sought is “fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and … fairly reflect[s] the delay or impediment sustained by [them]” (GC 40.1).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) GC 40.2 required that the defendants submit a notice of a claim for an extension of the time for completion together with the particulars of the event or circumstances justifying the extension as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of such event or circumstance. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) GC 40.3 requires that the defendants use their “reasonable efforts to minimize [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] any delay in the performance of [their] obligations under the [Agreements]”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The practical <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of a successful EOT Defence might be the same as a successful Partial Estoppel Defence (assuming it had been raised) or analogous to a successful Estoppel Defence.

In particular, the Arbitration Claimants had the option of choosing whether they wished to fully engage with the Piecemeal Rectification Delay Issue in order to respond to the Estoppel Defence. As submitted by CAI, the Arbitration Claimants had a potential “silver bullet” in the form of GC 3.9 to counter the Estoppel Defence.

This being the case, it cannot be said that the Piecemeal Rectification Delay Issue was in issue in any meaningful way during the Arbitration or that all the relevant facts and evidence impinging on the EOT Defence were already in the arena before the Defendants’ Closing Submissions were filed. I reiterate that the Estoppel Defence and the EOT Defence are conceptually distinct with different legal and factual elements. As such, CAI did not have every opportunity to engage with the EOT Defence on the basis of the evidence and submissions adduced in respect of the Estoppel Defence, as the defendants suggested. Put simply, no opportunity could have arisen because the Arbitration Claimants did not have reasonable notice that it was necessary to engage with the Piecemeal Rectification Delay Issue until the EOT Defence belatedly appeared.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) The consequence of the belated raising of the EOT Defence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In my judgment, the belated introduction of the EOT Defence meant that the Arbitration Claimants were deprived of a reasonable opportunity to respond to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I take the defendants’ case at its highest and assume that it was open to the Tribunal to make a finding that an extension of time was warranted under GC 40 even though it is common ground that: (a) the defendants did not comply with the notice provisions under GC 40.2; and (b) that B had never formally granted an extension of time to CAK under the Agreement (Award at paragraphs 285–288). Even so, it would still be necessary for the defendants to show that the period of extension is “fair and reasonable in the circumstances” under GC 40.1 and that they had used their “reasonable efforts to minimize [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] any delay in the performance of [their] obligations under the [Agreements]” under GC 40.3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 GC 3.9 would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have afforded the Arbitration Claimants an answer to the EOT Defence on the facts of the present case.

Therefore, it is logical and I accept CAI’s submission that to rebut the defendants’ evidence and submissions on the Piecemeal Rectification Delay Issue <span class="font-italic">in the context of the EOT Defence</span>, the Arbitration Claimants would have needed to seek disclosure, adduce evidence and advance submissions on the following issues:

</div> The areas canvassed at [103] above relate to whether GC 40 was even applicable on the facts of the dispute and if so, the appropriate length of an extension of time, if any, to be allowed under GC 40. To understand why these areas could have made a meaningful impact on the Tribunal’s decision on the EOT Defence, one need look no further than the Award itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 There, the Tribunal <span class="font-italic">itself</span> recognised at various junctures that there was a lack of <span class="font-italic">critical evidence</span> on which to base its decision on the EOT Defence. I list three key examples of this which relate precisely to the further areas raised by CAI. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Tribunal stated that there was a dearth of detailed evidence as to how Concurrent Rectification Works would have been carried out (Award at paragraph 313): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is nothing in GC 40.1 which precludes the Tribunal from granting [CAK] an EOT, once it has considered all the circumstances, if the Tribunal finds that GC 40.1(e) is engaged. <span class="font-italic">One </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">critical circumstance</span><span class="font-italic"> is that detailed evidence concerning precisely how [CAK] would have gone about rectifying the motor vibrations, if it were not for the piece-meal schedule, is not before the Tribunal</span>.

Even if the grant of an extension of time under GC 40 was well within the Tribunal’s discretion, the precise length of the extension to be granted had to be determined with reference to the factual matrix of the case. In this regard, I agree with CAI that it was precisely the Tribunal’s role to reach its conclusions based on the evidence presented by the parties. While the evidence may not be determinative, it does not follow that it is unnecessary or unhelpful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Returning to [103(c)] above, it is noteworthy that the Tribunal does not appear to have put its mind to GC 40.3 in the Award, despite this being one of the conditions for the grant of an extension of time under GC 40.

</div>
</div> In my judgment, this submission misses the point. In this regard, Vinodh Coomaraswamy J’s analysis of the two aspects of a reasonable opportunity to present one’s case in <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 768 (“<span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries</span>”) is instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">146 There are two aspects to a party’s reasonable opportunity to present its case: a positive aspect and a responsive aspect. The positive aspect encompasses the opportunity to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law on which it positively relies to establish its claim or defence, as the case may be. The responsive aspect encompasses the opportunity to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law necessary to respond to the case made against it. It is the responsive aspect of the opportunity to present its case which JVL alleges the tribunal denied it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">147  The responsive aspect of presenting a party’s case has itself two subsidiary aspects to it. The first is having notice of the case to which one is expected to respond. The other is being permitted actually to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law necessary to respond to it. A tribunal will therefore deny a party a reasonable opportunity to respond to the case against it if it either: (a) requires the party to respond to an element of the opposing party’s case which has been advanced without reasonable prior notice; or (b) curtails unreasonably a party’s attempt to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law which are reasonably necessary to respond to an element of the opposing party’s case. But there is a third situation in which a tribunal will deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case: when the tribunal adopts a chain of reasoning in its award which it has not given the complaining party a reasonable opportunity to address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 CAI’s case in OS 1103 in respect of the Primary NJ Breach is focussed on the <span class="font-italic">responsive aspect</span> of having a reasonable opportunity to respond to the <span class="font-italic">case made against it</span>. The defendants’ submission thus misses the mark: a reasonable opportunity to present one’s case under Art 18 of the Model Law requires that <span class="font-italic">the Arbitration Claimants </span>(not the defendants) had a reasonable opportunity to present its case, and more importantly, to respond to the defendants’ belatedly raised EOT Defence with evidence and legal arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 With the greatest respect to the Tribunal members, they too seemed to have missed the point. At paragraph 290 of the Award, the Tribunal reasoned as follows in allowing <span class="font-italic">and</span> ruling on the EOT Defence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it felt that the “new argument” was perfectly capable of being considered by the Tribunal;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Arbitration Claimants’ Submissions were prepared and filed in response to the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Arbitration Claimants therefore had an opportunity to respond to the Defendants’ Closing <span class="font-italic">Submissions</span> on the EOT Defence; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">the defendants</span> were entitled to make use of the evidence which already existed to make good <span class="font-italic">their</span> arguments on the EOT Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Even on a generous reading of this paragraph of the Award, it is clear to me that the Tribunal did not consider the Arbitration Claimants’ objection that <span class="font-italic">they</span> had not been given any opportunity to lead evidence or cross-examine the defendants’ witnesses, or seek document disclosure to respond to the EOT Defence. The Tribunal appears to have focused on the <span class="font-italic">defendants’</span> right to use the existing evidence to advance the EOT Defence. In my view, the Tribunal failed to adequately consider whether the <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Claimants</span> had sufficient opportunity to, for example, marshal their own evidence to meet the EOT Defence. That was where the process failed and procedural unfairness was occasioned. A chance to respond to the counterparty’s legal submissions on a newly raised defence cannot constitute a reasonable opportunity to present one’s case if the evidence that might support one’s arguments had not been adduced during the arbitral proceedings. Whilst paragraph 98 of the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions (reproduced at [46] above) did attempt to make some substantive arguments on the EOT Defence, I disagree that it was demonstrative of the Arbitration Claimants having had a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case to the EOT Defence. The Arbitration Claimants were entitled to be given a reasonable opportunity to respond, not perfunctorily, but in a fulsome manner to the EOT Defence. Paragraph 98 must also be viewed in the context of paragraphs 94 and 97 of the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions where they had objected to the EOT Defence even being raised at that stage of the Arbitration and had asked the Tribunal to disregard it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Although CAI may have strategically made the Tactical Decision while dealing with the evidence led by the defendants in respect of the Estoppel Defence, the landscape pertaining to the Vibration Issue was, in my judgment, materially altered when the conceptually distinct EOT Defence was sought to be put into play in the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. I reiterate that at that point of the arbitral proceedings, document disclosure, witness evidence, cross-examination and oral closing submissions had all been completed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The defendants’ submission at [114] above fails for another reason: the evidence and facts adduced by the defendants concerning<span class="font-italic"> </span>the two rectification schedules and the time taken to rectify each set of compressors (see above at [89]) were wholly insufficient. It hardly needs to be said that the actual time taken to complete the Piecemeal Rectification Works and the two rectification schedules pertained specifically to <span class="font-italic">Piecemeal Rectification Works </span>– they did not demonstrate how long it would have taken for <span class="font-italic">Concurrent Rectification Works </span>to be completed. This very point is reflected in the Tribunal’s own reasoning when it rejected the evidence adduced by the defendants.

</div> the Tribunal stated that it did not have sufficient evidence as to whether CAK could have carried out Concurrent Rectification Works in the same time it would have taken as the Piecemeal Rectification Works. As such, “the Tribunal [did] not wholly accept the [defendants’] submissions, in so far as they [are] relevant to estimating a time period in which [CAK] could have introduced the permanent counter-measures into each of the six (6) compressors”. Thus, the evidence that the defendants claim allowed them to present their case on the EOT Defence could not have afforded the Arbitration Claimants a reasonable opportunity to respond to the EOT Defence simply because the “evidence” in play then was not directly relevant to the EOT Defence. Instead, one would have to rely on “inductive logic” to extrapolate from the length of time taken to rectify two compressors to determine the time to rectify all six compressors concurrently.

</div> As such, it is fallacious for the defendants to contend that the “exact same facts and evidence” adduced by the defendants in respect of the Estoppel Defence afforded the Arbitration Claimants a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case in respect of the EOT Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 To conclude this section, in my judgment, CAI did not have a fair and reasonable opportunity to present its case in respect of the EOT Defence. The EOT Defence was a completely new defence that was introduced at an extremely late stage in the arbitral proceedings which, up to that point, had only really focussed on the Estoppel Defence. The EOT Defence was conceptually and factually distinct to the Estoppel Defence and needed to be dealt with and addressed in a different fashion. Furthermore, even if it was possible for the defendants to advance the EOT Defence based on the exact same evidence relied upon in respect of the Estoppel Defence, this does not aid the defendants’ case for two reasons. First, the crux of Art 18 of the Model Law is not whether the defendants could advance their EOT Defence, but rather whether the Arbitration Claimants could respond to it. Second, the evidence relied upon by the defendants was, in any event, insufficient to ground their own EOT Defence, much less a rebuttal of it from the Arbitration Claimants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The alleged invitation by the Tribunal </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In my view, the Arbitration Claimants could not have predicted or foreseen the raising of the EOT Defence. They were accordingly deprived of a reasonable opportunity to present their case on the EOT Defence because they did not have “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">notice</span> of the case to which [they are] expected to respond” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([114] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [146]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As stated previously, there was no hint of the EOT Defence until it appeared in the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. In response to this, the defendants refer to the comments of one of the Tribunal members made on the last day of the oral hearing to argue that they had introduced the EOT Defence upon <span class="font-italic">the invitation</span> of the Tribunal to both parties to deal with alternative bases of relief from liquidated damages. This being the case, the Arbitration Claimants had notice of the EOT Defence (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>as an alternate basis of relief from liquidated damages) and had subsequently taken the opportunity to respond substantively to the argument in the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I disagree with the defendants. In my view, the Tribunal did not specifically invite submissions on the EOT Defence or “alternate bases of relief from liquidated damages” or authorise the raising of new defences. As to whether the EOT Defence had been introduced upon the invitation of the Tribunal is a question that features more significantly in respect of Issue 2, I will only address it here briefly (see below at [206]–[214] for further elaboration). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is clear that even if one of the Tribunal members’ views could be taken as being representative of the Tribunal’s views, the Tribunal was thinking only of existing defences and arguments that had already been made, as opposed to authorising or inviting the parties to raise new and hitherto unpleaded defences. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, even taken at its highest, the discussion cannot be interpreted as a license for parties to introduce new defences without seeking leave from the Tribunal to do so.

</div> The Arbitration Claimants had expressly pointed out in their pleadings that the defendants were <span class="font-italic">not </span>seeking an extension of time under GC 40 in response to the claims for liquidated damages (see [40] above). The defendants did not deny this and the parties dealt with the Vibration Issue on the basis that GC 40 was not in issue in the dispute. The Arbitration Claimants could not, therefore, be expected to predict a 180 degree about turn in the Defendants’ Closing Submissions right at the tail end of the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue 1(b): Whether the Arbitration Claimants’ conduct in the Arbitration amounted to hedging </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The defendants argue that if the Arbitration Claimants had truly felt that it had no opportunity to properly deal with the factual or legal bases of the EOT Defence, it was incumbent on them to make the relevant objections to the Tribunal forcefully and unequivocally rather than to hedge their bets by objecting half-heartedly, then proceeding to respond and thereafter waiting for the Award. Mr Thio SC described this as the Arbitration Claimants’ “heads, I win; tails, I win” hedging strategy. The defendants add that the Arbitration Claimants never sought leave from the Tribunal to: (a) put forth further factual and expert evidence that it now claims was material to the outcome of the EOT Defence and the Arbitration; (b) cross-examine the defendants’ witnesses; and (c) make further legal submissions on the EOT Defence.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In my judgment, the Arbitration Claimants’ conduct during the Arbitration and the objections they raised in their closing submissions did not amount to hedging. They had objected sufficiently clearly and unequivocally to the EOT Defence in the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions. Their silence in the period leading up to 10 September 2018 when the Tribunal declared the arbitral proceedings to be closed does not undermine their clear and unequivocal position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The pertinent principles in relation to hedging were explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">168 … An assertion that the tribunal has acted in material breach of natural justice is a very serious charge, not just for the imputation that such an allegation makes as to the bona fides and professionalism of the tribunal, but also for the grave consequence it might have for the validity of the award. For this reason, <span class="font-italic">there can be no room for equivocality in such matters. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An aggrieved party cannot complain after the fact that its hopes for a fair trial had been irretrievably dashed by the acts of the tribunal, and yet conduct itself before that tribunal “in real time” on the footing that it remains content to proceed with the arbitration and obtain an award, only to then challenge it after realising that the award has been made against it</span>. In our judgment, such tactics simply cannot be countenanced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">170  In our judgment, there is a principle to be drawn from this and it is this: <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if a party intends to contend that there has been a fatal failure in the process of the arbitration, then there</span><span class="font-italic"> must </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">be fair intimation to the tribunal that the complaining party intends to take that point at the appropriate time if the tribunal insists on proceeding. This would ordinarily require that the complaining party, at the very least, seek to suspend the proceedings until the breach has been satisfactorily remedied (if indeed the breach is capable of remedy) so that the tribunal and the non-complaining party has the opportunity to consider the position</span>. This must be so because if indeed there has been such a fatal failure against a party, then it cannot simply “reserve” its position until after the award and if the result turns out to be palatable to it, not pursue the point, or if it were otherwise to then take the point. After all, the requirement of a fair process avails both parties in the arbitration and to countenance such hedging would be fundamentally unfair to the process itself, to the tribunal and to the other party. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In the final analysis, it is a contradiction in terms for a party to claim, as CMNC now does, that the proceedings had been irretrievably tainted by a breach of natural justice, when at the material time it presented itself as a party ready, able and willing to carry on to the award. If a party chooses to carry on in such circumstances, it does so at its own peril. The courts must not allow parties to hedge against an adverse result in the arbitration in this way</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-justify">(1) The objection in the Arbitration Claimant’s Closing Submissions </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In my judgment, the objection raised by the Arbitration Claimants to the EOT Defence in their Closing Submissions was not half-hearted, perfunctory or an attempt to hedge their bets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 To fully appreciate the nature of the Arbitration Claimants’ written objections it would be useful to again lay out the relevant paragraphs in full (see [46] above):

For that reason alone, it should not be considered by the Tribunal. The procedural unfairness point is particularly acute with this final new claim, as the [defendants] attempt to put more and more emphasis on discussions or alleged agreements which have not been the subject of pleadings, focused document production, witness evidence or cross-examination</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">This includes the fact that not only were the [Arbitration] Claimants denied the opportunity in this regard, but also the fact that the [defendants] did not subject the [Arbitration] Claimants’ witnesses to any cross-examination to give them a chance to explain their positions (on the unpled issues). </span>This approach runs entirely contrary to the purpose of the detailed Procedural Orders. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98. In any event, this new GC 40 claim has three insurmountable flaws: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, the plain wording of GC 40.1 has not been satisfied: even on the [defendants’] case they have not been “<span class="font-italic">delayed or impeded in the performance of any of its obligations…</span>” There is no dispute that they failed to complete by the Time for Completion, and the events to which they refer arose both (a) only after the Time for Completion, and (b) as a direct consequence of the [defendants’] admitted breach of contract. GC 40 cannot have been intended to apply in these circumstances: its purpose was to avoid the application of the prevention principle prior to that point in time. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Second, the [defendants] have not complied with the mandatory pre-requisites for such an extension at GC 40.2, which are if anything even more explicit and extensive than those for GC 39, or identified nay mutual agreement by which these have been waived.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, as has been addressed above, there is no evidence upon which the Tribunal can properly find there was any delay to which the clause could apply. Even if there were, GC 40.1 only permits an Extension of Time ‘<span class="font-italic">by such period as shall be fair and reasonable</span>’. By the time of the events relied upon by the [defendants], it was already inevitable that they would be liable to pay Liquidated Damages to the [Arbitration] Claimants, and GC 40 could not ‘<span class="font-italic">fairly’</span> or ‘<span class="font-italic">reasonably</span>’ operate so as to the defeat the claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in underline and italics; emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 At paragraph 94, the Arbitration Claimants expressly asked that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the EOT Defence be disregarded and made specific reference to the procedural unfairness. In paragraph 97, the Arbitration Claimants not only laid out their objection again to the introduction of the EOT Defence, but also explained the basis for their objection again. This encompassed several areas of procedural unfairness, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the unfairness due to its belated introduction, the lack of any opportunity to: (a) test the evidence relied upon by the defendants; and (b) adduce their own evidence to rebut the EOT Defence. I note also that paragraph 97 of the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions broadly mirrors CAI’s case in OS 1103. The Tribunal had thus been given some prior warning as to the substance of the case that the Arbitration Claimants might take up in setting aside or enforcement proceedings against the Award if it had proceeded to rule on the EOT Defence. Therefore, in the <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> sense (at [170]), and in the specific context of this case, the objections raised in paragraphs 94 and 97 were, in my view, already a form of “fair intimation” to the Tribunal, even though <span class="font-italic">strictly speaking</span> at that point in time, there was as yet <span class="font-italic">no</span> breach of procedural natural justice by the Tribunal; nonetheless, the objection was raised by the Arbitration Claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The defendants have made much about the relevance of the eminence and experience of the Tribunal who are all experienced legal practitioners and arbitrators.

</div>
</div> In my view, this argument is a double-edged sword and works against the defendants. The Tribunal’s undoubted legal and arbitration experience meant that its members would have appreciated the nature of the objections being raised, particularly the repeated emphasis by the Arbitration Claimants on procedural unfairness. I disagree that the Arbitration Claimants’ objections in their closing submissions were half-hearted, perfunctory objections that merely made generic motherhood statements without due elaboration. In my judgment, there was no equivocality in the Arbitration Claimants’ response and objections to the EOT Defence or to the manner in which it was raised by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I am conscious of the fact that the Arbitration Claimants then went on, at paragraph 98, to point out “three insurmountable flaws” with the EOT Defence. The defendants leverage on this and argue that: (a) the Arbitration Claimants were hedging their bets because they had already objected to the EOT Defence at paragraph 97 but nonetheless went on to substantively engage with the EOT Defence on its merits; and (b) paragraph 98 was evidence that the Arbitration Claimants had the opportunity to respond to the EOT Defence and had taken it.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I disagree with the defendants’ contentions for two reasons. First, the brief observations in paragraph 98 do not constitute a “fair and reasonable opportunity” to respond to the EOT defence. I agree with the submissions of counsel for CAI, Mr Cavinder Bull SC, that the Arbitration Claimants were only able to point out “threshold issues” in a cursory manner as opposed to engaging with the merits of the EOT Defence in a fulsome way. This was because they did not possess sufficient evidence in respect of it (nor had they been given the opportunity to test the defendants’ evidence in respect of it).

</div>
</div>
</div> Second, I agree with CAI that there is nothing inherently inconsistent with briefly pointing out obvious flaws with the EOT Defence while simultaneously objecting in principle to its late introduction. The Arbitration Claimants had already pointed out their objections to the EOT Defence even being considered, <span class="font-italic">twice</span> in the earlier paragraphs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, the defendants submit that that the Arbitration Claimants ought to have proactively sought leave to adduce further evidence, test the evidence adduced by the defendants or tender further legal submissions. They aver that the Arbitration Claimants’ failure to do so was emblematic of hedging. The defendants also argue that if indeed the Arbitration Claimants had a “silver bullet” in GC 3.9 to deal with the Estoppel Defence, then their objections to the EOT Defence (which did not engage GC 3.9) would have been much stronger. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For the reasons given above, I disagree that the Arbitration Claimants’ objections were half-hearted or insufficiently emphatic. Further, the defendants’ argument places the cart before the horse. The defendants did not plead or otherwise raise the EOT Defence at any point prior to the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. It was a new defence introduced at an extremely late stage in the proceedings. I agree that the initial burden of seeking leave to introduce this new defence thus laid on the defendants, be it by way of amendment to their pleadings and/or to adduce the necessary evidence to support their wholly new argument or defence<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Econ Piling Pte Ltd and another (both formerly trading at Econ-NCC Joint Venture v Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 246 at [85] and [86], <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v </span><span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals </span>[2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>”) at [33] and [48]).

</div>
</div> Only if that was done would the Arbitration Claimants then have the burden of objecting to the EOT Defence and/or to seek further directions from the Tribunal in respect of it. Be that as it may, whilst the defendants did not first seek leave to introduce the EOT Defence, the Arbitration Claimants nonetheless objected to it at the earliest opportunity afforded to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 To summarise, the Arbitration Claimants’ objection to the EOT Defence in their closing submissions was clear and unequivocal.

</div>
</div> In a similar vein to their argument reproduced at [134] above, the defendants argue that the Arbitration Claimants’ silence meant that their objection was equivocal and emblematic of hedging because they did not “at the very least, seek to suspend the proceedings until the breach [had] been satisfactorily remedied (if indeed the breach is capable of remedy) so that the tribunal and the non-complaining party [had] the opportunity to consider the position” (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [170]). This showed that the Arbitration Claimants were “clearly content to proceed to the Final Award” in reliance on their earlier submissions and the earlier Tactical Decision. According to the defendants, this silence was also part of the Arbitration Claimants’ overall “heads, I win; tails, I win” hedging strategy with regard to the EOT Defence.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 18 May 2018, the Arbitration Claimants wrote to the Tribunal advising that one of the English authorities cited in their Closing Submissions had since been overturned on appeal. This letter did not touch on the EOT Defence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 24 May 2018, the defendants wrote to the Tribunal alleging that the Arbitration Claimants had raised new arguments in their closing submissions and their letter of 18 May 2018, and then proceeded to respond to various points. This letter also did not touch on the EOT Defence. I refer to it as the “24 May 2018 Defendants’ letter”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 26 May 2018, the Arbitration Claimants provided a further response to the Tribunal complaining that the defendants were making further submissions and stating that the onus was on the defendants to make the proper application to the Tribunal if they wished to adduce a further round of written submissions. They asked that the 24 May 2018 Defendants’ Letter be disregarded almost entirely and expressly reserved their rights in respect of the same. I refer to this letter as the “26 May 2018 Arbitration Claimants’ Letter”. This letter similarly did not contain anything pertaining to the EOT Defence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 28 May 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the parties advising that it took the view that the 24 May 2018 Defendants’ Letter would not be ignored. The Tribunal requested the Arbitration Claimants to “respond to whatever part of the [24 May 2018 Defendants’ Letter] that it objects against”. The Arbitration Claimants were not to “raise any new submissions beyond what has been raised by the [24 May 2018 Defendants’ Letter]”. I refer to this letter as the “28 May 2018 Tribunal Letter”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 30 May 2018, the Arbitration Claimants provided their response. Again, nothing was said in relation to the EOT Defence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) On 1 June 2018, costs submissions were filed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) On 22 June 2018, reply costs submissions were filed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) On 19 July 2018, supplemental costs submissions were filed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) On 10 September 2018, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed. The Award was released to the parties on 11 March 2019, some six months after the close of proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Three points emerge from the above timeline of events after the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions: (a) the Arbitration Claimants had time and opportunity to follow up on their objections to the EOT Defence; (b) they took the opportunity to alert the Tribunal that one of the authorities relied on by them had since been overruled; and (c) the Arbitration Claimants did not follow-up on their objection or make any further application in respect of the EOT Defence up to the point where the Tribunal declared proceedings to be closed. The key question to consider is whether the Arbitration Claimants were required to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I answer this question in the negative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In my judgment, the Arbitration Claimants’ silence in respect of the EOT Defence after their closing submissions were tendered neither undermines their position that the Tribunal ought not to have allowed and ruled on the EOT Defence, nor illustrates that they were trying to hedge their position. This is because the Arbitration Claimants’ duty to give fair intimation to the Tribunal and/or to seek to suspend the arbitral proceedings <span class="font-italic">had not yet arisen</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 When the Tribunal declared the close of the arbitration proceedings, this signalled to the parties that the arbitral process would be coming to an end, after which no more money or effort was to be expended and the award would be rendered (Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>, (Wolters Kluwer 2014, 2nd Ed) at pp 2296–2297). The significance of this in the case before me is that it potentially meant that one of three scenarios could play out: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Tribunal would not allow the EOT Defence and would disregard it (“Scenario 1”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Tribunal would allow the EOT Defence to be raised and rule on it based on the evidence and submissions presented to it prior to the close of the hearing (“Scenario 2”); or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Tribunal would allow the EOT Defence, and if allowed, would permit further evidence and/or submissions to be introduced, and also permit the re-opening of the hearing, if necessary (“Scenario 3”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Arbitration Claimants were, in my view, entitled to assume, and reasonably so, that by declaring the proceedings closed without any further indication in relation to the new EOT Defence, the Tribunal would either not allow it to be raised, or would allow it to be raised but only after re-opening the proceedings and permitting further pleadings, discovery, and/or evidence in respect of the same in order to afford the Arbitration Claimants a reasonable opportunity to challenge the EOT Defence. This being the case, two of the three scenarios (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Scenarios 1 and 3) at [143] above would have been permissible to the Arbitration Claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Court of Appeal held that a court analysing whether a party has been denied his right to a fair hearing by a tribunal’s conduct of the proceedings must ask itself what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal might have done bearing in mind the precise factual matrix confronting the tribunal then (at [98]). The arbitral process is dynamic; the fairness of the procedure used can only be judged against what the parties may be taken as having agreed to and expected <span class="font-italic">by what they contemporaneously communicated to the tribunal, and which is conducting the proceedings in real time</span> (at [101]). In the context of a challenge directed at the exercise of the tribunal’s procedural discretion, there cannot be any non-compliance with natural justice if the complaining party has not informed the tribunal of what, in its view, such compliance required (at [102]). Reading these three paragraphs in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> together, the duty of the complaining party to inform the tribunal of an alleged breach is necessarily contingent on the complaining party <span class="font-italic">first knowing</span> that the tribunal <span class="font-italic">has</span> taken a step in the conduct of the proceedings that the complaining party considers to be a breach of procedural fairness. Only then can the complaining party’s duty to give fair intimation to the tribunal arise, and for that party to state what, in its view, compliance with procedural fairness would require. If, <span class="font-italic">at that point</span>, the complaining party does not object, objects equivocally or simply reserves its rights while indicating that it is prepared to continue with the arbitral proceedings, that is when hedging and equivocation may be said to have arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 This, however, is not the case here. Here, the Arbitration Claimants had objected, in their Closing Submissions, to the introduction of the EOT Defence and specifically mentioned the ground of procedural unfairness. As such, the factual context indicates that the ball was in the Tribunal’s court to rule upon the Arbitration Claimants’ objection to the EOT Defence. As I have already highlighted earlier, after the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions were filed, the proceedings for all intents and purposes had come to an end, unlike for example, in <span class="font-italic">ASM Shipping</span> ([137] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) or <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>. Thus, it was only if and when the Tribunal had made a ruling on the EOT Defence that <span class="font-italic">either </span>party would be aware of any breach of natural justice or procedural unfairness <span class="font-italic">on the Tribunal’s part </span>– that is when the duty to provide fair intimation to the Tribunal would have arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 View through that lens, the breach of natural justice only occurred <span class="font-italic">when the Final Award had been delivered</span>. It did not, in my view, occur when the proceedings were declared closed or at any point prior to it simply because at any point along that spectrum, no one knew if the EOT Defence had been allowed or not. I do not think, even on the authority of <span class="font-italic">China Machine, </span>that the burden was on the Arbitration Claimants to follow-up on its objection and demand a ruling from the Tribunal prior to the close of proceedings. They were entitled to reasonably assume that the EOT Defence would either be disallowed by the Tribunal or, in the alternative, that if it was allowed, they would be permitted to respond to it properly so as to remedy any prejudice to the Arbitration Claimants occasioned by allowing the EOT Defence to be introduced at that late stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 CAI thus had no opportunity to give any unequivocal intimation to the Tribunal to object to the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, simply because it was too late to do anything once the Award had been published. The somewhat unusual and unique factual circumstances of the present case mean that the principle as distilled at [170] in <span class="font-italic">China Machine, </span>does not quite apply in the context of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As a counter-argument, it might be said that when the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed and in light of the objection to the EOT Defence that had already been raised by the Arbitration Claimants, there was at that point a <span class="font-italic">potential</span> breach of procedural natural justice because the Tribunal had not yet ruled on the said objection. Flowing from this, one might then argue that it was incumbent on the Arbitration Claimants to object to the closing of proceedings until they had received a ruling because if they failed to do so, they might run the risk of the occurrence of Scenario 2 (see [143(b) ] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 However, I do not consider that the bar has been pushed that high by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In my view, the flip side of the complaining party being obliged to raise its objection with the tribunal unequivocally is that it must be reasonably clear to the complaining party that a breach by the tribunal <span class="font-italic">has</span> occurred and not just that a possibility exists or that there is a potential prospect of a breach of the rules of natural justice by the tribunal. This must logically follow since the party is complaining that it <span class="font-italic">was</span> or <span class="font-italic">had been</span> deprived of the reasonable opportunity to be heard by reason of the actions of the tribunal and then intimates to the tribunal that unless the breach is remedied by the tribunal, the aggrieved party will suspend the arbitral proceedings and seek recourse from the court. In most, if not all cases, that deprivation resulting in a breach of natural justice will be known to the complaining party only when the decision or ruling by the tribunal <span class="font-italic">has in fact been made.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>In a case such as the present where an objection had been raised and the tribunal’s decision was awaited, to require the objecting party to anticipate or second-guess the tribunal’s next step or to anticipate that a potential breach might occur at some later stage in the proceedings would, in my view, place too high a burden on the complaining party and effectively, set the bar beyond reach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 I deal finally with the defendants’ argument that the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BBA and others v BAZ and another appeal</span> [2020] 2 SLR 453 (“<span class="font-italic">BBA</span>”) at [90] (citing <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [168] and [170]) shows that an actual decision by a tribunal is not necessary before a breach of natural justice can arise and that the Court of Appeal’s comments in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>stand as authority for a wider principle “of fairness, one of anti-hedging and anti-gaming the system”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 This argument, even if accepted, does not further the defendants’ case. <span class="font-italic">BBA</span> must be understood in the context of its facts. In <span class="font-italic">BBA, </span>the sellers of shares sought to argue that the majority of the arbitral tribunal had acted in breach of natural justice because they found the sellers to be jointly and severally liable to the buyer, BAZ, without inviting submissions on this particular point or giving any indication that joint and several liability would be the eventual result (<span class="font-italic">BBA</span> at [86]). The Court of Appeal roundly rejected this argument as it took the view that if a point was <span class="font-italic">not</span> taken before the tribunal at all in “real time”, the majority of the tribunal “cannot be faulted for not foreseeing any complications and not dealing with this issue in depth in the Award, <span class="font-italic">when nothing was put forward</span> to suggest that this was going to be anything other than a straightforward issue” (<span class="font-italic">BBA </span>at [90]) [emphasis added]. Thus, taking the point before the Tribunal was a facet of giving “fair intimation” to the tribunal in the sense advocated for in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span>. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">BBA</span>, the Court of Appeal was reiterating what it had already made clear in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [167], namely, that “a tribunal cannot be criticised for failing to consider points <span class="font-italic">not put to it</span>” [emphasis added]. The situation in the case before me is, however, quite different. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">BBA</span> where counsel for the sellers did not take any point on joint and several liability or forewarn the tribunal that it might be an issue <span class="font-italic">particularly in the light of the terms of reference and the pleadings</span> <span class="font-italic">in that case</span> (<span class="font-italic">BBA</span> at [90]–[91]), the Arbitration Claimants <span class="font-italic">did</span> raise their objections before the Tribunal on the EOT Defence and expressly flagged them out in the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions. The objections included that the EOT Defence had, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, not been pleaded and should be disregarded. As such, even on the defendants’ broader reading of <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> in the light of <span class="font-italic">BBA, </span>the Arbitration Claimants did give “fair intimation” to the Tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 To summarise this section, that the Arbitration Claimants did not follow-up on their objections to the EOT Defence after the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions were tendered does not undermine their position. There was no hedging or equivocality on their part. Having objected to the EOT Defence, the duty to provide any further intimation to the Tribunal or to seek to suspend proceedings did not arise on the facts of this case, at least not until the release of the Award by which time it was too late.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue 1(c): Whether the Primary NJ Breach was connected to the making of the Final Award and materially prejudiced CAI’s rights </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 As I have found above, there was a Primary NJ Breach on the facts of this case. In sum, in allowing the EOT Defence without affording the Arbitration Claimants a chance to: (a) obtain amended pleadings from the defendants; (b) require further discovery from the defendants; (c) adduce further evidence including expert evidence; and/or (d) test the defendants’ “evidence” in cross-examination, the Tribunal deprived the Arbitration Claimants of a reasonable opportunity to respond to the EOT Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I have reminded myself that the overarching inquiry is whether the Arbitration was conducted in a manner which was fair (see [66(e)] above). I am also conscious that the burden on CAI is a high one. Having considered the facts of this case carefully, I am of the view that what the Tribunal did in this case fell <span class="font-italic">outside</span> the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal might have done in those circumstances. I am thus satisfied that the first two requirements of the test summarised at [66] above have been met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The requirements to be satisfied for setting aside an award based on breach of natural justice are clear. A party who seeks to set aside an award on this ground must not only establish a breach of natural justice but also cross two remaining hurdles, namely, to show that there was a causal nexus between the breach and the making of the arbitral award, and that the breach prejudiced the aggrieved party’s rights (see <span class="font-italic">AKN</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In this case, the breach of natural justice that accompanied the making of the Award did, in my view, occasion material prejudice to the Arbitration Claimants’ rights. As a result of the breach, the Tribunal was denied the benefit of evidence (including in particular expert evidence) and arguments that had a real (as opposed to a fanciful) chance of making a difference to its decision (see <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>”) at [54]). The relevance (and absence) of both factual and expert evidence being expressly pointed out by the Tribunal itself at various sections in the Award (see, for example paragraphs 313 and 314 as reproduced in [108(a)] and [108(c)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In my judgment, the breach of natural justice was causally connected to the making of the Award and did occasion prejudice to the Arbitration Claimants. If the Arbitration Claimants had been given the opportunity to lead further evidence, test the defendants’ evidence and tender further legal submissions, this could in my view have reasonably made a difference to the Tribunal’s determination (<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure </span>at [54]). As I elaborate below, the Tribunal appears to have based its grant of a 25-day extension of time on little more than its professed experience. It is thus a likely and reasonable assumption that with the benefit of fuller evidence (both factual and expert) upon which to inform its decision on GC 40, the extension of time (if any) allowed by the Tribunal could have been different. It would not be fanciful to contend that the Tribunal could be persuaded, with the benefit of full evidence and argument, to allow an extension of <span class="font-italic">less</span> than 25 days or <span class="font-italic">no</span> extension at all. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Secondary NJ Breach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Having dealt with the Primary NJ Breach above, I turn now to the Secondary NJ Breach. CAI submits that there was a further breach of natural justice by the Tribunal. This was because the Tribunal arrived at a specific figure of 25 days’ extension of time without giving the Arbitration Claimants an adequate opportunity to present their case on the EOT defence, without any evidence upon which to base that decision, and by relying <span class="font-italic">on its experience </span>without informing the parties that it would be doing so.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Unlike the Primary NJ Breach which is largely concerned with a failure in the procedural process of the Arbitration, the Secondary NJ Breach is concerned with a situation where the Tribunal adopted a chain of reasoning in the Award which it did not give the Arbitration Claimants an opportunity to address (see <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries</span> ([114] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [146]). The Secondary NJ Breach thus does not touch on procedural fairness in the sense of the conduct of the arbitral proceedings<span class="font-italic">. </span>This complaint was grounded on the argument that the Tribunal reached a conclusion based on an idea that it invented by itself. By doing so, it took the parties by surprise and did not afford one or both parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Before delving into the parties’ detailed arguments, it is apposite to first examine how the Tribunal arrived at its decision to allow a 25-day extension of time, before examining its reasoning to determine if the Tribunal had indeed relied primarily on its unarticulated experience.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Tribunal’s reasoning </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The Tribunal began by recognising that the Admitted Instruction had caused delay to CAK such that an extension of time would be necessary (Award at paragraph 326). Its line of reasoning was as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At paragraph 312, the Tribunal found that the wording of GC 40.1 conferred on it a “wide discretion” to determine the length of any extension of time to be granted under GC 40.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At paragraph 327, the Tribunal recognised that there was “no direct evidence before the Tribunal establishing how long permanent counter-measures would have taken to be implemented, absent B’s involvement in the issue”. However, it found that it was “capable of fairly and reasonably ‘<span class="font-italic">in all the circumstances</span>’ of calculating a time period which reflects the delay or impediment suffered by CAK as required by GC 40.1” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At paragraph 328, the Tribunal stated that it had “considered all of the evidence before it in order to determine that <span class="font-italic">it is capable</span> of finding a length of time in respect of which an EOT should be granted”. In a similar vein, the Tribunal at paragraph 333 stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Tribunal does not have sufficient evidence before it as to determine whether [CAK], with the allocation of resources available to it at the time could have achieved the rectification of all six (6) compressors in a similar time as it took to rectify only a pair of compressors. <span class="font-italic">Thus the Tribunal does not wholly accept the [defendants’] submissions in so far as they [sic] relevant to estimating a time period in which [CAK] could have introduced the permanent counter-measures into each of the six (6) compressors</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At paragraph 334, the Tribunal rejected the defendants’ “ultimate submission” that a 71-day extension of time ought to be granted. It stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [defendants’] ultimate submission is that the rectification work could have been completed in its entirety by 11 April 2013, yet [CAK] was delayed until 21 June 2013, representing a delay of 71 days, in respect of which the [defendants] contend an EOT should be granted. However, the Tribunal is not minded to give an EOT of that length on the basis of the above reasons. <span class="font-italic">In the Tribunal’s view taking into account all the evidence and its experience in these matters</span>, the Tribunal considers and determines that 25 days extension of time would be an appropriate EOT to grant to [CAK], in all the circumstances which reflects the delay which was caused by [B] which would not otherwise have occurred if there was no requirement that the vibration issue be fixed on a piece-meal basis. Had the [defendants] procured further evidence, or even obtained expert evidence, then perhaps an extension of time of 71 days could have been granted to them. But this was not done. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) At paragraph 335, the Tribunal noted and disposed of the Arbitration Claimants’ submissions that there was “no evidence upon which the Tribunal can determine that the [defendants] are entitled to an extension of time”. The Tribunal stated that even though <span class="font-italic">“there is no expert evidence presented which precisely points to a 25 day extension”</span> [emphasis added], it would not be fair and reasonable to conclude that there is no entitlement to any extension of time at all. It found that a 25-day extension of time represented the culpability of the Arbitration Claimants of around 25% in circumstances where the length of delay to Mechanical Completion was approximately 100 days.

</div> However, the critical point here is that the Tribunal had <span class="font-italic">expressly rejected</span> these pieces of evidence when arriving at its decision to award a 25-day extension of time under GC 40.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 After summarising the defendants’ submission that Concurrent Rectification Works could have been completed within 30 days and the evidence in support of this submission at paragraphs 328–331 of the Award, the Tribunal went on to state that it did not accept the defendants’ submission for three reasons (Award at paragraph 332): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the submission does not precisely point to how the calculation of this theoretical time period of thirty (30) days has been calculated;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) further, the [defendants’] submission cannot precisely detail the start and end of the relevant periods of work on which they rely; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) no pair of compressors took the same amount of time to rectify as can be seen from the work dates (at [330] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This being the case (and despite its indications otherwise), the Tribunal did not, in my view, actually rely on <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the evidence adduced by the defendants when it granted the 25-day extension of time. The question then is: what did the Tribunal rely on?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Tribunal’s reliance on its “experience in these matters”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The Tribunal stated that it had relied on “all the evidence and its experience in these matters” in arriving at the figure of a 25-day extension of time. As such, a process of elimination would lead to the conclusion that if the Tribunal did not have sufficient “evidence” or, in reality, did not rely on the evidence that it had before it, then a substantial part of the Tribunal’s decision making process must have been based on its professed experience. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 This is, in my view, problematic for two reasons. First, the Tribunal’s decision on a highly fact specific issue, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the length of delay attributable to the Admitted Instruction, was not backed by any evidence. Second, the Tribunal arrived at the figure of 25 days without explaining how and on what evidential basis it came to that landing. The somewhat vague reference to the 25 days reflecting the defendants’ own culpability of about 25% was also not explained.

</div> Further, the Tribunal did not, in the Award, elucidate or explain what its professed experience was “in these matters” generally or on this issue specifically. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 An analogy can, in my view, be drawn between the present case and the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>([156] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). There, the arbitral tribunal reformulated the appellants’ claim for damages from a “loss of profits” claim to a “loss of a chance to earn profits”. This new claim was only raised on the final day of the arbitral proceedings by the tribunal. During the oral exchange with the parties, the tribunal suggested that were it to proceed on a “loss of chance” analysis, it would need help to determine the quantum of the chance lost. The issue, however, was that the parties were never given the opportunity to address the tribunal on this particular new point. Nonetheless, the tribunal proceeded to rule on the new “loss of chance” formula and eventually arrived at a loss of 55% chance which translated into a monetary award of US$80m “without <span class="font-italic">any </span>apparent analysis or consideration over and above its…approximation, and without any submissions having been sought or made on the quantum of the chance lost” (at [76]). The Court of Appeal held that there was a breach of natural justice as the tribunal was uncertain of, and ill-equipped to deal with the quantum of the opportunity lost and had also failed to request further arguments on this point despite being aware of the need for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171  I agree with CAI’s submission that if the Tribunal wished to rely on its past experience, whether wholly or substantially, in arriving at a conclusion on an issue where direct and relevant evidence was <span class="font-italic">admittedly</span> sorely lacking, the parties ought to have been given a chance to comment and provide submissions on the Tribunal’s thinking or proposed line of reasoning.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Nevertheless, the rules of natural justice do require, even in an arbitration conducted by an expert, that matters which are likely to form the subject of decision, in so far as they are specific matters, should be exposed for the comments and submissions of the parties. If an arbitrator is impressed by a point that has never been raised by either side then it is his duty to put it to them so that they have an opportunity to comment. If he feels that the proper approach is one that has not been explored or advanced in evidence or submission then again it is his duty to give the parties a chance to comment. <span class="font-italic">If he is to any extent relying on his own personal experience in a specific way then that again is something he should mention so that it can be explored. It is not right that a decision should be based on specific matters which the parties have never had the chance to deal with, nor is it right that a party should first learn of adverse points in the decision against him</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Unfortunately, the Tribunal did not do this.

In my view, this too occasioned procedural unfairness to the Arbitration Claimants. The defendants argue that the mere fact that the Tribunal reached a decision between the two diametrically opposed options of zero days’ extension of time and 71 days’ extension of time is not a justifiable basis for setting aside the Award. Citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> (at [63], [65(d)] and [65(e)])<span class="font-italic">, </span>the defendants submit that the requirement that a tribunal does not adopt a chain of reasoning in its award which the parties have not been given a reasonable opportunity to address, does not mean that the Tribunal is confined only to the binary options in the parties’ arguments.

</div> That case involved a contractor who had sought and obtained a five-day extension of time to complete certain construction works. The arbitrator felt that five days was not fair and reasonable and hence set time at large. The finding that time was at large had not been argued during the arbitral proceedings. There are three main differences between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the pleadings in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>contained the “constantly reiterated refrain that time had been set at large (albeit in different contexts)” and this must have alerted the respondent to the appellant’s submission that time was at large (at [34]). Here, there was no mention of the EOT Defence until the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the tribunal in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>had specifically called for further submissions on the disputed issue of whether time should be set at large (at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Court of Appeal found that the issue of whether time had been set at large was based on the same facts as the existing issue of whether the appellant was entitled to an extension of time, so much so that they could be described as being two sides of the same coin (at [94]). However, as I have found above, the EOT Defence and the Estoppel Defence are conceptually <span class="font-italic">and factually</span> distinct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Without the necessary evidence to assist it, it could be said that, just as in <span class="font-italic">AKN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([156] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Tribunal was “ill-equipped” to come to a decision on the length of the extension of time for Mechanical Completion that it considered fair and reasonable in all the circumstances, irrespective of its experience or eminence in this area. Whilst the test under GC 40 may be imprecise, any decision on the length of an extension of time would necessarily have to be grounded on some evidence before the Tribunal from which it could make its assessment. Otherwise, if the Tribunal was relying substantially on its experience, it should have given the parties notice of its thinking and invited submissions on it. One option would have been for the Tribunal to invite the parties to make submissions on the basis of a possible line of reasoning articulated by the Tribunal, without the Tribunal having yet come to any concluded view on the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I thus agree with CAI that there was also a Secondary NJ Breach in the making of the Award. This affected the Award and occasioned prejudice to the Arbitration Claimants as they were unable to present any evidence or submissions targeted at the Tribunal’s experience which the Tribunal later relied upon to grant the 25-day extension of time to the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Ultimately, I come back again to the key question that has to be asked: whether what was done (or not done) by the Tribunal was within the range of what a fair-minded and reasonable tribunal would have in the given circumstances (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [98]). In my judgment, CAI has discharged the high burden on it to show that the above question must also be answered in the negative in relation to the Secondary NJ Breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 To end off this section, the defendants take the position that if any of the breaches of natural justice complained of by CAI are made out, the setting aside proceedings ought to be suspended for the Award to be remitted to the Tribunal pursuant to Art 34(4) of the Model Law. I address this issue below when I consider the Excess of Jurisdiction Ground.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In my view, to construe the EOT Defence as falling within the abovementioned issues, in particular issue (f), would effectively denude the purpose of having the Terms of Reference in the Arbitration in the first place. If accepted, the defendants’ contention would mean that the Terms of Reference would potentially encompass any unpleaded issue so long as it had some tangential impact on the amount, if any, of liquidated damages payable. The Terms of Reference encompassed the issues that had been raised by the parties <span class="font-italic">in their pleadings</span>. It is not disputed by the defendants that the EOT Defence was <span class="font-italic">not</span> pleaded. For the defendant to then argue that it nevertheless fell within the substance of issues (d)–(f) in the Terms of Reference was, to me, a clear attempt by the defendants to try and shoehorn the EOT Defence into the Terms of Reference after the fact and with the benefit of hindsight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The defendants candidly accept that they had not pleaded or contemplated the EOT Defence until the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. The reasonable inference that arises from this acceptance is that not just the defendants but <span class="font-italic">all </span>the parties to the Arbitration proceeded in the knowledge that GC 40 and the EOT Defence were <span class="font-italic">not</span> among the issues submitted to the Tribunal for its consideration and consequently, were not in play. The defendants’ attempt to read the EOT Defence as falling within the Terms of Reference is essentially an unabashed attempt, <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> post facto</span>, to force a square peg into a round hole in order to force fit the EOT Defence into the Terms of Reference. The facts and circumstances of this case however clearly demonstrate that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of the parties contemplated the EOT Defence at any time prior to the Defendants’ Closing Submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Further, Mr Thio SC’s invitation that I look at the substance of issue (f) in the Terms of Reference seeks to persuade me to ignore other relevant context and all the other steps taken by the parties during the arbitral process and instead, to simply focus on one broadly drafted issue in the Terms of Reference in a vacuum. I disagree that that is the correct approach. I should consider the pleadings, the Terms of Reference and all other steps taken in the arbitral process to <span class="font-italic">then</span> determine if, in substance, the EOT Defence had been submitted to arbitration by the parties. In determining this question, a practical and commonsensical view should be taken.

In my view, <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>can be distinguished because the issue in question there was the <span class="font-italic">measure</span> of damages applicable. In the specific context of the case, the fact that the appellants had prayed for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>“damages” in the notice of arbitration and its pleadings was sufficient to put the issue of damages into the arena and therefore, within the scope of submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The present case is, to my mind, quite different because the EOT Defence is dependent on the contractual wording of GC 40 and the elements contained therein.

It is however altogether another matter to contend that, therefore, the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> EOT Defence and <span class="font-italic">all</span> the issues connected with it “in substance” fell within the Terms of Reference or the defendants’ draft list of issues.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendants provide two examples of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 The first is the decision of Chan Seng Onn J in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”) which states that (at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In some cases, whether a particular matter or issue in dispute has been submitted to the arbitral tribunal is contentious. Sometimes, as in the present case, the parties will submit a memorandum of issues. However, that may not be exhaustive proof of the matters that are within the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction. In the first place, memoranda of issues may contain catch-all provisions which give arbitral tribunals the discretion to decide on matters which are not expressly listed. Indeed, in the present case, the MOI conferred on the Arbitrator the discretion to rely on additional facts or law which are necessary to decide the dispute. Furthermore, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> at [33], pleadings and their contents are also relevant as they illuminate the matters that have been submitted to the arbitral tribunal. In fact, <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> recognised (at [47]) that “any new fact or change in the law arising after a submission to arbitration which is ancillary to the dispute submitted for arbitration and which is known to all the parties to the arbitration is part of that dispute and need not be specifically pleaded”. <span class="font-italic">Hence, an issue which surfaces in the course of the arbitration and is known to all the parties would be considered to have been submitted to the arbitral tribunal even if it is not part of any memorandum of issues or pleadings.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The second example is the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Prometheus Marine Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span>”) where Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, delivering the judgment of the Court, stated that (at [58]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… while pleadings in arbitral proceedings can provide a convenient reference point to determine the scope of an arbitrator’s jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is by no means limited by the pleadings because a practical view has to be taken regarding the substance of the dispute being referred to arbitration. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Having regard to both cases, I am of the view that <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>must be read and understood in its proper context. It is clear from the decisions handed down by the Court of Appeal after <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>([135] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (<span class="font-italic">ie, AKN</span> ([156] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [46] and <span class="font-italic">Prometheus </span>at [58]) that pleadings are still an important reference point to determine what are the issues that have been placed before a tribunal for determination. While it may not be the <span class="font-italic">only</span> reference point, its importance has not been diluted by <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> as the defendants appear to suggest. In <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> at [52], Chan J was referring to the scenario painted in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski,</span> <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the law had changed or a new fact arose after the arbitration reference had started and such change was known to the parties, these need not be specifically pleaded. It does not, however, mean that a new defence or issue that is raised does not need to be pleaded or properly brought into the arena in good time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 As such, <span class="font-italic">TMM, </span>read in its proper context, does not in my view open the door for an arbitrant to raise a new claim, defence or issue at any stage of the arbitration and in any manner it pleases. The pleadings, Terms of Reference and lists of issues are still important and relevant anchor points delineating the four corners of the dispute and equally, if not more importantly, the scope of the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. In this regard, one has to always bear in mind that in an arbitration, the tribunal’s jurisdiction is demarcated by what the <span class="font-italic">parties agree</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to submit to the tribunal for determination (<span class="font-italic">Kempinski </span>at [32]). Therefore, even adopting a practical approach to pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">Prometheus </span>[63]), in both <span class="font-italic">AKN</span> and <span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span>, it was clear that there was <span class="font-italic">some</span> reference in the pleadings to the claim, defence or issue that the tribunal eventually decided upon, and which was therefore enough to clothe it with jurisdiction. The case at hand stands on an entirely different footing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I would make a final point. In the EOT Defence, the defendants sought an extension of time of 71 days. In monetary terms, that represented 7.1% of the contract price. To put matters in perspective, the Tribunal’s award of 75 days’ worth of liquidated damages (or 7.5% of the contract price) amounted to approximately S$60 million and was almost equivalent to the extension of time sought by the defendants (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> 71 days vs 75 days). Thus, the EOT Defence, if allowed, would have potentially reduced the defendants’ liability by approximately S$60 million. By any definition, this would have been a material and significant defence to raise. Yet, the EOT Defence was only raised by the defendants at the eleventh hour. Given its substantial impact on the defendants’ liability were the EOT Defence to prevail in full, one would have expected the EOT Defence to have figured prominently in the arbitration and in particular in the defendants’ pleadings, the Terms of Reference and/or the defendants’ list of issues. The fact that it did not and the defendants are now seeking to persuade the court that in substance, it fell within the Terms of Reference and/or the defendants’ list of issues fortifies my view that the parties never agreed to and did not submit the EOT Defence for determination by the Tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 To conclude, I agree with the defendants that the EOT Defence was not among the issues that the parties had referred to the Tribunal for determination. In my judgment, the Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to decide an issue that: (a) had never been pleaded; (b) was not contemplated by the parties at any stage of the Arbitration until the Defendants’ Closing Submissions were filed at the very tail end of the Arbitration; and/or (c) was never ventilated by the parties in the course of the Arbitration, including during the oral hearing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2(b): Whether the Tribunal had specifically invited submissions on the EOT Defence or “alternate bases of relief from liquidated damages”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The defendants submit that even if the EOT Defence did not initially fall within the substance of the dispute submitted for the Tribunal’s determination, it <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> fell within the terms and scope of submission to arbitration. This is because it was an argument that was specifically brought to the attention of the Arbitration Claimants who were then given (and did in fact take) the opportunity to respond to it when the Tribunal extended an invitation to parties on the last day of the oral hearing to consider alternate bases of relief from liquidated damages in their closing submissions.

In fact, Arbitrator A’s comments (quoted above at [207]) suggest that counsel for the Arbitration Claimants was not wrong to assume that Arbitrator A was referring to the Estoppel Defence. The same comment also indicates that Arbitrator A was clearly aware that if a tribunal wished to consider arguments that <span class="font-italic">had been</span> raised <span class="font-italic">but not fully</span> ventilated, there would be a need for parties to be afforded a “full opportunity for argument”. This awareness is at odds with the defendants’ suggestion that Arbitrator A had extended an invitation to or had authorised the parties to tender submissions on <span class="font-italic">completely new and unpleaded</span> defences dealing with the issue of liquidated damages on the Vibration Issue. It is also, in my view, noteworthy that Arbitrator A did not mention GC 40 at all during the exchange with the parties’ counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 In my view, the exchanges with Arbitrator A were, at best, equivocal. I disagree that they amounted to an invitation or authorisation by the Tribunal to introduce new defences not pleaded.

</div> a mere oral exchange between a Tribunal member and the parties cannot be interpreted as a license for parties to introduce a new unpleaded defence without first seeking leave, or authorisation, from the Tribunal to do so under Art 23(4) of the ICC Rules. The Tribunal did not state that it was authorising the EOT Defence at any point during the oral hearing or in the correspondence it exchanged with the parties afterwards. Nevertheless, it must have taken this position since it considered and ruled on the EOT Defence by allowing it in part. Therefore, in one sense, this meant that the Tribunal had failed to inform the parties that it was authorising the raising of a new defence until it became apparent to the parties when the Award was published. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 I agree with CAI that this is not what is contemplated by Art 23(4) of the ICC Rules. It cannot be the case that the Tribunal may expand the scope of its jurisdiction by simply deciding upon new claims or defences in the Award, on the purported authority of Art 23(4) of the ICC Rules. While an arbitral tribunal is ordinarily the master of its own procedure in an arbitration, the requirement of due process is an essential limitation on the wide autonomy that the parties and the tribunal have with respect to procedure (<span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [2]). If the Tribunal was seeking to rely on Article 23(4) of the ICC Rules, procedural fairness would, at the very least, require that the Tribunal clearly intimate to the parties that it was intending to authorise a new claim or defence <span class="font-italic">having considered</span> the nature of the new claim (or defence), the stage of the arbitration and other relevant circumstances. Its decision would need to be conveyed to the parties <span class="font-italic">before</span> the Award was published in order for the parties to be given an opportunity to take steps as they might consider necessary to respond to the new claim or defence authorised by the Tribunal. I would add that such steps might <span class="font-italic">include</span> those envisaged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> at [170]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2(d): Whether the Arbitration Claimants had raised a jurisdictional challenge in respect of the EOT Defence before the Tribunal. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 In <span class="font-italic">BBA </span>([151] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal at [90] referred to its comments in <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [168] and [170] and made clear that a party in a setting aside application may not raise a challenge based on an excess of jurisdiction objection in circumstances when it did not do so expeditiously before the tribunal itself (or at all). In this connection, the court at [49] referred to Art 16(2) of the Model Law which provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later that the submission of the statement of defence. … A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 The defendants submit that CAI’s submissions on the Excess of Jurisdiction Ground ought not be countenanced by this court as it had failed to raise the objections before the Tribunal. This is because the Arbitration Claimants’ brief objections to the EOT Defence were <span class="font-italic">only</span> on the grounds of “procedural fairness” rather than an excess of jurisdiction.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I disagree with the defendants’ contentions. As I have found at [136], the Arbitration Claimants had unequivocally objected to the introduction of the EOT Defence. While they may not have specifically used the phrases “outside the scope of submission to arbitration” or “excess of jurisdiction”, there is no requirement in law for a jurisdictional objection to follow any formulaic incantation. As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 131 (at [57]), “the ‘plea’ or objection to jurisdiction which Art 16(3) refers to does not need to be in any specific form or worded in any specific manner”. The focus is on the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the objection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 In my view, the Tribunal would have seen and treated the objection raised as <span class="font-italic">including</span> an objection to jurisdiction. The Award itself contains indications that this was how the Tribunal dealt with the objection raised by the Arbitration Claimants at paragraphs 94 and 97 of the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions. The Tribunal stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">289. On the contrary, the [Arbitration] Claimants contend that the [defendants’] claim for an extension of time <span class="font-italic">was only raised in their written closing submissions and, accordingly, should not be considered</span> by the Tribunal. In this regard, the [Arbitration] Claimants <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">also</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>raise<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>a procedural unfairness point …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The italicised words were, in my view, a recognition by the Tribunal that the argument that the EOT Defence, only having been raised in the defendants’ closing submissions, was not an issue or dispute that had been introduced into the arena, and therefore, “should not be considered” by the Tribunal. The word “also” in bold italics clearly suggests that the Tribunal saw the Arbitration Claimants’ objection as going <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> excess of jurisdiction to also <span class="font-italic">include</span> procedural unfairness and natural justice. In my judgment, this was a sufficiently clear indication that the Tribunal understood the objection as, in substance, also encompassing a jurisdiction point and dealt with it on that basis. As such, there is no merit in the defendants’ contention that a jurisdictional objection was not taken by the Arbitration Claimants before the Tribunal. In my view, it was. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 The defendants also submit that CAI “cannot belatedly cry foul” when it had “responded at length to the submissions [on the EOT Defence] without raising any doubts about the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider them”.

</div>
</div> This argument is unpersuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In <span class="font-italic">BBA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([151] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal observed at [49] that the appellant’s counsel’s submissions before the tribunal on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital formula used to calculate the average rate of return that the respondent would make on its return (“WACC”) was done <span class="font-italic">without informing the tribunal</span> that adopting the WACC could lead to an excess of jurisdiction. In contrast, in this case, the Arbitration Claimants had raised their jurisdictional and procedural unfairness objection to the Tribunal’s consideration of the EOT Defence at the first available opportunity, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>in the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions (at paragraphs 94 and 97). Paragraph 98 of the Arbitration Claimants’ Closing Submissions must be read in that context and not in isolation. The arguments raised in that paragraph as to the “three insurmountable flaws” in the EOT Defence must be seen as subsidiary to the Arbitration Claimants’ primary objection that the Tribunal ought not to consider the EOT Defence at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 To summarise this sub-issue, the Tribunal, in ruling on the EOT Defence and granting a 25-day extension of time to the defendants in reliance on GC 40, dealt with a dispute that did not fall within the terms of the submission to arbitration. The Award thus contained decisions on matters beyond the scope of the parties’ submission to arbitration. The EOT Defence did not fall within the parties’ pleaded cases, the Terms of Reference or the list of issues submitted for the Tribunal’s determination. Further, the Tribunal did not specifically invite submissions on new and unpleaded alternate bases for relief from liquidated damages. Nor did it authorise the bringing of the EOT Defence. Finally, I am satisfied that Arbitration Claimants did raise the jurisdiction objection before the Tribunal and were accordingly not precluded from raising it in OS 1103.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2(e): Whether the Tribunal’s consideration of the EOT Defence materially prejudiced CAI’s rights</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Issue 2(e) can be dealt with briefly. To set aside an arbitral award on the grounds of excess of jurisdiction, as with the breach of natural justice ground, the court must also be satisfied that the aggrieved party has suffered actual or real prejudice (see <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [72] ([156] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), <span class="font-italic">CRW </span>([183] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [37], <span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([201] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [63]). The test of “actual prejudice” under Arts 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) and 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) are the same (see <span class="font-italic">AMZ</span><span class="font-italic"> v AXX </span>[2016] 1 SLR 549<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [104]). The aggrieved party must show that the tribunal could reasonably have arrived at a different result but for the breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 For the same reasons set out above at [154]–[158] in relation to Issue 1, there was, in my view, prejudice to CAI by reason of the Tribunal exceeding its jurisdiction. Having rejected the defendants’ primary case that the Abnormal Vibrations did not cause any delay to Mechanical Completion and their secondary case on the Estoppel Defence, the Tribunal granted a 25-day extension of time to the defendants on the sole basis of the EOT Defence. As such, there was a clear causal nexus between the breach (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>considering and deciding on the EOT Defence) and the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 To conclude, I answer Issue 2 (see [65]) in the affirmative. As for the consequences on the Award of my decision on this issue, I discuss this when I address Issue 4.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Approbation and reprobation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 The defendants argue that CAI has accepted payment of the liquidated damages under the Award and has thus taken the benefit of that part of the Award that it likes. As such, it is prevented from challenging the Award by the doctrine of approbation and reprobation.

The court found that it was inequitable for the wife to then subsequently rely on the defence of undue influence against the bank’s claim for possession. The wife had obtained an actual benefit in the form of an order of conveyance in the matrimonial proceedings – this was based at least in part on her position that the bank’s charge over the property was valid. Further, she had the option of informing the matrimonial court of the change in circumstances before the property conveyance order was finalised.

CAI seeks only to set aside a discrete portion of the award – namely the grant by the Tribunal of a 25-day extension of time.

</div> There, the sellers had accepted the buyer’s payment pursuant to one part of the award that was in its favour but subsequently sought to set aside the award on the basis that one of the three arbitrators had failed to append his signature to the award. This irregularity infected the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> award and not just certain discrete sections of it. Accordingly, the English Court of Appeal held that as the sellers had accepted payment under the first part of the award, they were precluded from disputing the award and contending that they did not like the second part which had gone against them. That was a clear example of the sellers wishing to have their cake and eat it. In the present case, however, CAI is not disputing the entirety of the Award while accepting payment under it and it (unsurprisingly) accepts that the defendants ought to pay liquidated damages to it on account of their delay in achieving Mechanical Completion. As such, in challenging the 25-day extension of time granted to the defendants, CAI is not taking inconsistent positions or approbating and reprobating.

This, the defendants contend, is impermissible and would amount to the court granting substantive relief in the form of a variation of the Award, a power it does not possess under the IAA.

</div> To be more specific, I am of the view that when a court exercises its power to set aside an offending part of an arbitral award, already built into that power is the ancillary power to also set aside or remove dispositive parts of the award which are infected by the decision concerned. I disagree that in doing so, the court is varying the award. This is not a novel concept, nor is it unprincipled.

Chua J analysed the tribunal’s findings in the award and found that it was possible to sever <span class="font-italic">other findings</span> of the tribunal if they “were linked to and flowed from its finding [which was made in breach of one of the grounds in Art 34]” or, in other words, “inextricably linked” to the impugned finding (see [72]–[76]).

</div> Chua J then went on to set aside a number of the tribunal’s findings, including one on the plaintiff’s lack of good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 More recently, Anselmo Reyes IJ (sitting in the Singapore International Commercial Court) agreed, in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, with <span class="font-italic">GD Midea </span>and concluded that “[w]here part of an award has been set aside, other parts may consequentially be set aside where they are ‘inextricably linked’ to or ‘flow from’ the tribunal’s findings which have been set aside” (<span class="font-italic">CBX and another v CBZ and others </span>[2020] SGHC(I) 17 at [71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 Returning to the facts of the present case, I am of the view that the court must be and is empowered to make consequential or ancillary orders to give effect to the setting aside of the Tribunal’s decision to grant a 25-day extension of time. In so doing, the court is not drawing on any “general or residual powers” in contravention of Art 5 Model Law. Rather, it is a power that flows from its <span class="font-italic">express jurisdiction</span> under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) Model Law to set aside an award, or part of it. It cannot be the case that that the court is only empowered to set aside the dispositive <span class="font-italic">section</span> of the Award granting 74 days’ worth of liquidated damages and nothing else. If the defendant’s contention is correct, then the Award would be completely hamstrung – the Award cannot be remitted because I have found that the EOT Defence was not within the scope of submission, yet the dispositive section awarding the Arbitration Claimants 74 days’ worth of liquidated damages would have been set aside. The result is that the Award would then be left in a limbo. This would mean that whatever was awarded to the Arbitration Claimants is set aside and would have to be returned to the defendants. CAI would then be left with the wholly unattractive and uncommercial proposition of having to re-commence fresh arbitration proceedings, assuming that is even possible given the effluxion of time. That, in my view, simply cannot be right or a just outcome. The answer to the scenario painted above cannot be that the court is powerless to do anything else and since parties have chosen arbitration as their dispute resolution mechanism, that is the consequence of the parties’ autonomous choice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 In any case, reading the Award closely and as a whole, I do not agree that the Tribunal only found 99 days’ worth of delay and not 99 days’ worth of liquidated damages. At paragraph 282 of the Award, the Tribunal found that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The consequence of determining that Mechanical Completion was reached on 21 June 2013 is that there are <span class="font-weight-bold">99 days of delay </span>between 14 March 2013 (<span class="font-italic">being the starting point of the damages calculation</span>) and that date …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The words in italics indicate that when the Tribunal referred to 99 days of delay, it was really focusing on 99 days of “culpable” delay for which <span class="font-italic">damages are payable </span>prior to taking into account any extension of time under GC 40. In essence, the Tribunal used the expressions “days of delay” and “days of liquidated damages” interchangeably. This reading of paragraph 282 is consistent with paragraphs 338 and 339 of the Award which concerned the calculation of the amount of liquidated damages: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">338. Given that the Tribunal has found that Mechanical Completion was reached on 21 June 2013, the [Arbitration Claimants] are entitled to 74 days of liquidated damages (being the 99 days of delay minus the 25 day extension of time)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">339. On this basis outlined above, the parameters of the [Arbitration Claimants’] liquidated damages Claim, in respect of the Motor Vibration Issue can be summarized [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] as follows …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liquidated Damages Calculation (Onshore Agreement)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">First Day that Liquidated Damages started to accrue </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">15 March 2013 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Last Day on which Liquidated Damages accrued </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">21 June 2013</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">EOT granted to the [defendants]</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">25 Days </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Liquidated Damages per Day</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">0.1% of the Contract Price</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Total Amount of Liquidated Damages </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">7.4% of the Contract Price</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I do not reproduce the table which the Tribunal used to calculate the liquidated damages payable by the defendants under the Offshore Agreement as they are almost identical in layout. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 This being the case, the effect of setting aside the part of the Award granting the 25-day extension of time does not therefore interfere with any findings of fact made by the Tribunal.

I thus reformulate CAI’s second prayer and order that “Consequently, the number of days of delay set out in the Award for which liquidated damages are payable is to read as 99 days.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Finally, I record my appreciation to both Mr Bull SC and Mr Thio SC for their helpful and lucid submissions, which afforded this court considerable assistance in navigating through the numerous points and issues that arose in OS 1103.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 I will hear the parties separately on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">S Mohan <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cavinder Bull SC, Lin Shumin and Amadeus Huang Zhen (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) (instructed), Nicholas Jeyaraj s/o Narayanan and Chik Hui Rong Crystal (Nicholas &amp; Tan Partnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Md Noor E Adnaan and Neo Zhi Wei, Eugene (TSMP Law Corporation) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
