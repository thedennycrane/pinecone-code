        Then Ling AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Chun Cheng Fishery Enterprise Pte
                    Ltd, is and was at all material times a company incorporated in Singapore, in
                    the business of importing and exporting marine products and other frozen
                    seafood, as well as processing, curing and preserving marine products and frozen
                    seafood. The plaintiff also has a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in the
                    United States called Chun Cheng USA <b>(“CCUSA”</b>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s board of directors
                    comprises Lin Chao Feng (“<b>LCF</b>”), who
                    is the chairman and his wife, Tan Guan Ngo (“<b>TGN</b>”), who is the managing director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant, Chuang Hern Hsiung
                        (“<b>CHH</b>”), was employed as the
                    Group President and Chief Executive Officer of the plaintiff while the second
                    defendant was the Vice-President of Development of the plaintiff. The second
                    defendant, Chuang Hsin-Yi (“<b>CHY</b>”),
                    is CHH’s eldest son. Both the defendants were directors of CCUSA. They
                    were summarily dismissed from CCFE on 21 October 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 21 October 2005, the plaintiff commenced
                    an action against the defendants for, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    damages for the defendants’ breaches of contractual and fiduciary duties,
                    damages for conspiracy and damages for unlawful interference in the
                    plaintiff’s business and/or contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial for the issue of liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The trial for the issue of liability was heard
                    from 29 March to 18 April 2007. On 17 January 2008, the trial judge
                    granted, <em>inter alia</em>, (1) interlocutory judgment
                    for the plaintiff for damages for the defendants’ breach of contractual
                    and fiduciary duties, conspiracy to injure and unlawful interference in the
                    plaintiff’s business; and (2) such damages shall be assessed by the
                    Registrar. The trial judge further held, in his Grounds of Decision
                        (“<b>the GD</b>”) dated 18 August
                    2008, that the interest in respect of the professional fees of Chio Lim &amp;
                    Associates be for the period July 2005 to December 2006 at 5.33% per annum from
                    the date of the writ until payment, interest on the remaining damages to accrue
                    from date of judgment at the same rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Dissatisfied with the trial judge’s
                    decision, the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal by way of CA16/2008 and
                    CA17/2008. Both appeals were dismissed with costs. However, the Court of Appeal
                    directed that the damages payable to the plaintiff be confined to the acts of
                    the defendants from 1 May 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties subsequently appeared before me for
                    the assessment of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the first day of the assessment, counsel for
                    the plaintiff, Mr Tan Cheng Han, S.C. (“<b>Mr Tan</b>”) informed the court that the parties had
                    agreed to partial settlement of the plaintiff’s claim, specifically, S/No.
                    1 – 14, 17, 22 and 23, at the global sum of S$143,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Accordingly, the only aspects of the
                    plaintiff’s claim left for the court to determine at the assessment of
                    damages hearing and the amounts sought by the plaintiff for each claim are as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The parties also agreed that the sum of
                    S$23,797.89 being disbursements for Fourwin is to be prorated based on what I
                    award for item (b) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   Professional fees of TecBiz Frisman Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff is seeking the total sum of
                    S$62,710.30 for TecBiz’s professional fees spread over five invoices for
                    computer forensic services, and surveillances services conducted on CHH between
                    27 July 2005 and 3 August 2005. The plaintiff submits that the trial
                    judge relied on the updates and reports of TecBiz in establishing the
                    defendants’ liability for their breaches and that the defendants are
                    therefore liable to pay the plaintiff the stipulated sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In reply, the defendants contend that
                    TecBiz’s professional fees form part of the plaintiff’s litigation
                    expenses for which the proper recourse for compensation is in the application
                    for an award of legal costs and disbursements. The defendants added that the
                    plaintiff has already been compensated for the legal costs and disbursements
                    they have incurred in respect of the trial and ought not to be allowed to claim
                    for TecBiz’s fees at the assessment of damages hearing. According to the
                    defendants, if the plaintiff’s solicitors failed to include TecBiz’s
                    professional fees when taxing the plaintiff’s bill of costs, the plaintiff
                    cannot now try to claim these expenses by asserting that they flow from the
                    defendants’ acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The issue of whether the expenses incurred by
                    the plaintiff to investigate the defendants’ transgression were claimable
                    was considered in <em>John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd and another
                        v Goh Sai Chuah Justin and Others</em> [2004] SGHC 76
                        (“<em>John While Springs</em>”). Like the
                    present case, <em>John While Springs</em> concerned an
                    application for the assessment of damages for the defendants’ breach of
                    fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs in that case sought to claim the amount spent
                    in hiring a company to investigate the defendants’ misdeeds. The
                    defendants raised a preliminary objection that the plaintiffs were estopped from
                    claiming the expenses as the plaintiffs did not claim them as disbursements
                    during taxation. Assistant Registrar Joyce Low referred to <em>British Motor Trade Association v Salvadori and Others</em> [1949]
                    1 Ch 556, and held (at [10]) that “[c]osts incurred by [the]
                    plaintiffs in investigating [the] defendants have previously been awarded to
                    [the] plaintiffs as damages … Such expenses result from the
                    defendants’ breach of fiduciary duties and accordingly, if proven, they
                    are claimable as damages”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is undisputed that the work done by TecBiz
                    uncovered the evidence of the defendants’ breaches. Accordingly, the
                    plaintiff is entitled to S$62,710.30 for TecBiz’s professional
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Professional fees of Fourwin Co. Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In May 2005, LCF engaged the services of a
                    financial and management consultant company in Taiwan, Fourwin Co. Ltd
                        (“<b>Fourwin</b>”) to analyse the
                    plaintiff’s financial status.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff is claiming S$496,530.46 for
                    Fourwin’s fees for the period May 2005 to March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendants submit that Fourwin’s
                    fees and disbursements are unmeritorious for the following main reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Fourwin and its consultants,
                        Christine Lin Shu Hui (“<b>Christine</b>”) and Stan Lee (“<b>Stan</b>”), lacked the expertise and/or qualifications to
                        advise and/or assist the plaintiff in restoring the plaintiff’s
                        business relationship with its bankers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The scope of the work allegedly carried out by
                        Fourwin and its consultants remains very much a mystery and Fourwin’s
                        fees are unverifiable. Even Christine was unable to explain fundamental
                        aspects of many of the alleged payment documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     There is little or no evidence to
                        substantiate work allegedly done by Fourwin and its
                    consultants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        few documents that have been furnished strongly suggest that the scope of
                        Fourwin’s engagement is unrelated to the acts of the
                        defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Whether it was reasonable
                        for the plaintiffs to engage Fourwin</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I am satisfied that it was reasonable for LCF
                    to engage Fourwin, a Taiwanese company, to analyse the plaintiff’s
                    financial status. LCF was aware that the defendants had an Insider team within
                    the plaintiff and needed someone he could trust to discuss the financial matters
                    of the plaintiff and to assist him. It was also not unreasonable for LCF to
                    engage a Taiwanese company. Both LCF and D1 are Taiwanese. Three of the eight
                    bankers of the plaintiff are Taiwan banks and LCF was until that time still
                    spending half his time in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     That said, I note that Fourwin’s website
                    offers handwriting analysis services and goes on at length on the benefits of
                    handwriting analysis. However, what is lacking is any reference to
                    Fourwin’s ability to provide business consultancy services and/or
                    restructuring. What is more puzzling is that Stan has absolutely no experience
                    in banking and corporate restructuring – a fact that was admitted by
                    Christine during her cross-examination (see NE of 23 July 2010 at p. 17,
                    lines 12-28 and NE of 23 July 2010 at p. 19, line 23- p. 20, line 21).
                    Christine, on the other hand, was previously the Senior Manager of Corporate
                    Recovery, Financial Advisory Services of KPMG for three years from November 1999
                    to September 2002. Given that Christine and Stan’s experiences are in
                    stark contrast to one another, it is incomprehensible for both Christine and
                    Stan to have the same billing rate. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that any
                    professional fee ought to be paid in relation to Stan’s services. Stan was
                    not called as one of the plaintiff’s witnesses. He has no expertise in
                    financial matters and I do not see how he could have provided any assistance to
                    the plaintiff, given that Fourwin was engaged to advice the plaintiff regarding
                    the finance and restructuring of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Fourwin’s billing system could have been
                    a lot neater. In my view, there were certain items in the invoices that were
                    unreasonable and ought not to be claimed. First, Fourwin was charging the daily
                    overseas fees, even though the meeting with the plaintiff was held within

                        lines 25-31]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, based on the third item of the
                    Consultancy Charges Table at page 125 of Christine’s AEIC, at Debit Note
                    No. FW050901 dated 8 September 2005, Christine is claiming for consultancy
                    charges from 16 August 2005 to 16 September 2005. She is also claiming
                    an overseas allowance for the same period. However, if we look at paragraph 47
                    (b)(i) of Christine’s AEIC, which sets out Christine’s flight
                    schedule, we will note that Christine left Singapore for Taiwan on
                    23 August 2005 and returned to Singapore on 30 August 2005. In other
                    words, Christine was not in Singapore between 24 August and 29 August
                    2005, yet she continued to charge consultancy fees and overseas
                    allowance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Third, based on the fourth item of the
                    Consultancy Charges Table at page 125 of Christine’s AEIC, at Debit Note
                    no. FW051001 dated 26 October 2005, Christine is claiming for work done her
                    and Stan from 18 August 2005 to 30 September 2005. This period
                    straddles two agreements: (1) the Revised Agreement which was effective for the
                    period commencing 1 July 2005 and ending 17 September 2005 stipulating
                    an overseas daily allowance of NY 4,800 per day per staff; and (2) the Second
                    Revised Agreement, which was effective for the period commencing
                    18 September 2005 and ending 1 October 2005 stipulating an overseas
                    daily allowance of NT 5,000 per day per staff. However, as can be seen from the
                    Consultancy Charges Table, the higher rate of NT 5,000 in the Second Revised
                    Agreement was used to calculate the total overseas allowance for that entire
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the plaintiff
                    is entitled to recover some of the money spent on Fourwin’s fees and will
                    allow the plaintiff to recover 20% of the amount claimed (<em>i.e</em>. S$496,530.46) in the light of the above inconsistencies and
                    Stan’s lack of any financial experience and expertise. Accordingly, the
                    plaintiff is entitled to $S99,306.09 for Fourwin’s professional fees and
                    S$4,759.57 for Fourwin’s disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   Professional fees of Chio Lim &amp; Associates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendants had spread damaging rumours
                    about the plaintiff to the plaintiff’s eight bankers. As a result, the
                    plaintiff’s credit facilities with the eight bankers were substantially
                    reduced. A joint bankers’ conference was held on 19 July 2005 and the
                    bankers requested for the appointment of a Special Accountant to look into the
                    plaintiff’s books so that an independent report would help to ascertain
                    the actual financial position of the plaintiff (see GD at [21]). Pursuant to the
                    plaintiff’s banker’s request, Mr Chee Yoh Chuang
                        (“<b>Mr Chee</b>”) of Chio Lim
                    &amp; Associates was appointed the Special Accountant on 22 July 2006.
                    Mr Chee’s duties as an independent accountant ended in February
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff is claiming the sum of
                    $311,153.43, for the professional fees of Mr Chee for the period July 2005
                    to December 2006. To this end, the defendants argue that Mr Chee’s
                    length of appointment was excessive. According to the defendants, the moratorium
                    period ended in November 2005 and credit facilities as well as normal relations
                    with the remaining banks resumed in December 2005. The defendants’ expert,
                    Mr Tam Chee Chong (“<b>Mr Tam</b>”), opined that the work performed by Mr Chee
                    subsequent to the moratorium period after normalization of banking relations
                    should not be claimed against the defendants. As such, the plaintiff is only
                    entitled to claim for Mr Chee’s professional fees from July to
                    November 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I can deal with this head of claim relatively
                    quickly. At [93] of the GD, the trial judge expressly stated that the plaintiff
                    is entitled to interest in respect of the professional fees of Chio Lim &amp;
                    Associates for the period <em>July 2005 to December
                        2006</em> at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ until payment.
                    In other words, the plaintiff is entitled to the professional fees of Chio Lim
                    &amp; Associates for the period <em>July 2005 to December
                        2006</em>. Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to the sum of
                    S$295,003.43 (after reducing $16,150 comprising of the work done in relation to
                    the litigation and finalization of Mr Chee’s AEIC).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Between 6 July 2005 and 16 July
                    2005, the plaintiff’s credit facilities were substantially reduced to
                    US$8.8 million as a result of various damaging rumours concerning LCF and the
                    company, which was spread by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     CTB informed the plaintiff by way of a letter
                    dated 6 July 2005 that they were suspending the plaintiff’s account with
                    immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On 11 July 2005, BOT informed the
                    plaintiff that it was suspending the plaintiff’s facilities with immediate
                    effect. BOT subsequently reduced the plaintiff’s facilities to US$750,000
                    in its letter dated 13 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 21 July 2005, CB issued a letter to
                    the plaintiff informing them that the undrawn portion of their facilities was
                    cancelled with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A banker’s conference was held on
                    19 July 2005 to dispel the rumours and Mr Chee was subsequently
                    appointed as a Special Accountant on 22 July 2005 to monitor and report on
                    the financial position of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the meantime, all eight banks suspended
                    their credit facilities with the plaintiff. In order to avoid the business of
                    the plaintiff coming to a complete halt if the banks were to continue reducing
                    their loans, the plaintiff requested a moratorium from the banks to allow the
                    plaintiff to put forward a plan to reduce and restructure the loans in an
                    orderly manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Whilst the banks were agreeable to a
                    moratorium till November 2005, in the meantime, the plaintiff was requested to
                    maintain the <em>pari passu</em> rule among the banks, to
                    be monitored by Mr Chee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     From July to November 2005 (<em>i.e</em>. the moratorium period), the plaintiff was unable to conduct
                    its business with the eight bankers in the usual manner. Instead, the plaintiff
                    had to pay a dollar in order drawn down a dollar of the facilities, yet trying
                    to ensure the loans (trust receipts) were not overdue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Termination of Credit Facilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     By 18 November 2005, BOT, CTB, CHB and CB
                    had terminated their credit facilities granted to the plaintiff. It is
                    undisputed that BOT and CTB terminated the facilities because of the prejudicial
                    rumours against the plaintiff. What is in dispute is whether CHB and CB
                    terminated their facilities for the exact same reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     According to the plaintiff, Mr Tam ought
                    to have conceded that just as BOT and CTB decided to terminate the facilities in
                    November 2005 because of the defendants’ acts, it was logical to conclude
                    that CHB and CB must have done so on the same basis. In reply, the defendants
                    submit that unlike BOT and CTB (where their July letters made reference to the
                    acts of the defendants), neither CB’s letter dated 21 July 2005 nor
                    CB’s termination letters in November 2005 make any reference to the acts
                    of the defendants. This lack of reference coupled with the fact that the
                    circumstances in November 2005 were completely different from those in July 2005
                    and the banks were likely to have considered other factors in November 2005,
                    show that it is far from being conclusive that CHB’s and CB’s exits
                    were due to the defendants’ acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I am satisfied that CHB and CB terminated the
                    credit facilities granted to the plaintiff due to the defendants’ acts.
                    First, it is not unusual for banks not to state their reasons for the
                    cancellation of the facility to a customer. To this end, the following exchanges

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Your Honour, banks do not normally put in writing.
                            They may convey that or say it on the side the reason but not in
                            writing. There are instances where to borrow may be in breach of certain
                            term of the loan and then the bank will normally cite that as a reason
                            for termination. That is common.</div>

                            they don’t usually give reasons unless the cancellation is due to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Second, cancelling the credit line in July
                    2011 was a strong indication that CB was no longer interested in maintaining
                    their relationship with the plaintiff. Moreover, I note that towards the later
                    part of the moratorium, BOT, CHB and CTB did not participate in any of the
                    meetings with Mr Chee and the plaintiffs. The four banks were simply not
                    interested in continuing their relationship with the plaintiffs – a
                    decision they had made when they cancelled/reduced the credit facility in July
                    2005.</p>

                            the management and the consultants had to address the banks on and to
                            convince the banks that they were up to it.</div>

<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, I find that the termination of BOT, CHB, CTB and CB
                    should be taken into consideration in assessing the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Quantification period</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mr Chee’s quantification period was
                    from October 2005 to December 2006. When asked during cross-examination by
                    Mr Lok as to how he arrived at the cut-off date of December 2006,
                    Mr Chee replied that by the end of 2006, the plaintiff changed its business
                    model after its discussions with a Japanese customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In contrast, Mr Tam was of the view that
                    the quantification period for the loss of business opportunities suffered by the
                    plaintiff as a result of the reduced credit facilities should be for a maximum
                    period of 3 months commencing 1 December 2005 (i.e. December 2005 to
                    February 2006). This was because, during the moratorium period of five months,
                    LCF and TGN with the assistance of Mr Chee would have had sufficient time
                    to normalise the plaintiff’s banking relationships with the existing banks
                    and dispel any damaging rumours that were circulating amongst the bankers as
                    well as reinstate the confidence of the bankers in the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I agree with Mr Lok that there was no
                    satisfactory reason why the quantification period ought to extend to December
                    2006. Mr Chee’s justification that December 2006 was chosen because
                    by then the plaintiff had changed its business model does not carry water. This
                    is because as early as 26 October 2005, a presentation on the
                    plaintiff’s restructuring exercise (to shift the market focus to Japan and
                    Korea) was conducted to the banks and there was no reason for the plaintiff to
                    sit on the restructuring plan for over 14 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is reasonable for the plaintiff to have
                    found its own two feet, albeit with the assistance of the special accountant, by
                    February 2006 (<em>i.e</em>. 6 months from the dismissal of
                    the defendants). In my view, 6 months was more than enough time for the
                    plaintiff to normalise its relationship with the banks, to convince the banks
                    that it had a good business model headed by a good team of competent individuals
                    and to increase its credit facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     With the exit of the four banks, the total
                    amount of credit facilities to the plaintiff was reduced from US$12.05 million
                    to US$6.95 million (a decrease of US$5.1 million). However, since the plaintiff
                    still had significant outstanding trust receipts in excess of US$6.95 million
                    due to the moratorium in the month of July to September 2005, the quantification
                    period I adopt is from October 2005 to February 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Loss of business opportunities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     According to the defendants, the plaintiff did
                    not suffer a reduction of revenue since there was no written evidence of loss of
                    business opportunities or holding back of purchases during the moratorium
                    period. However, I note that the plaintiff conducts its business informally.
                    When the plaintiff makes purchases, LCF will talk to the owners of the shipping
                    vessels over the telephone as to the type and quantum of fish the plaintiff
                    wishes to purchase. However, since the plaintiff was not able to commit
                    financially to make the purchases, the plaintiff was unable to commit to the
                    fishing vessel owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Whilst I am satisfied that the plaintiff held
                    back purchases due to its inability to commit to its suppliers, I note that
                    there was no written evidence before me with regards to the quantity and type of
                    the fish that the plaintiff would have purchase. Accordingly, I have to rely on
                    the historical data to determine the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I note that the plaintiff had initially
                    claimed for S$2.754 million. However, this figure was later revised to S$2.102
                    million in the plaintiff’s closing submissions (see [84] of the
                    plaintiff’s closing submissions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     At the outset, the plaintiff’s revised
                    computation and Mr Tam’s computation are largely similar – save
                    for the quantification period, the inclusion of CB and CHB’s termination
                    of credit facilities, gross profit margin (“<b>GPM</b>”), incremental staff costs and whether tax should be
                    deducted from the amount of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In Mr Tam’s computation,
                    Mr Tam took into account Mr Chee’s projected monthly sales for
                    October 2005 to June 2006 (paragraph 4.40 of Mr Tam’s report) and
                    reached the conclusion that since the FY05 annual projected sales was lower than
                    the plaintiff’s FY05 actual revenue, the plaintiff did not appear to have
                    lost any revenue nor business as a result of the suspension and subsequent
                    termination of selected credit facilities in FY05. As such, the quantification
                    period for loss of additional net profits allegedly suffered by the plaintiff
                    due to suspension/termination of credit facilities would be for January and
                    February 2006. To this end, it is clear from Mr Chee’s evidence that
                    the projections by Mr Chee during the moratorium period were based on the
                        <em>reduced</em> credit facilities. Accordingly, I do
                    not agree with Mr Tam that the quantification period for loss of additional
                    net profits due to the suspension/termination of credit facilities would be for
                    January and February 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In relation to the incremental staff costs, I
                    am satisfied that there is no need to deduct the incremental staff costs from
                    the loss of revenue/profit. To this end, I note that in 2003 and 2004, the
                    plaintiff’s staff costs went down despite the increase in revenue.
                    Accordingly, an increase in revenue does not necessarily equate to the
                    incremental staff costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Lastly, in relation to the GPM, Mr Chee
                    applied 15.5% whereas Mr Tam applied 11.2%. However, I note that during
                    cross-examination Mr Tam confirmed that there was no real difference
                    between his and Mr Tam’s computed GPM:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">I know there is a dispute between you and
                            Mr Chee as to what is the gross profit margin to take into
                            consideration …</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Perhaps I should clarify that I do not have any
                            disagreement between Mr Chee and myself in using the GPM. I believe
                            if I recollect correctly, that is merely a question of classification
                            where there is one item included in the GPM calculation that I had used
                            and that Mr Chee did not use but he subsequently used it below GPM
                            calculation, on a nett nett basis. I don’t think we have a
                            difference in view, it is just where we classify.</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">So you are not disputing Mr Chee’s
                            15.5% except that Mr Chee took into account carriage outwards at a

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(e)   Loss from overstocking mahi mahi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff is claiming S$513,000 as the
                    loss suffered due to the deliberate failure of the defendants to sell the
                    overstocked mahi mahi in CCUSA from 1 May 2005 despite clear instructions
                    from LCF to do so even if it was at a loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In reply, the defendants contend, <em>inter alia</em>, that (1) LCF’s instructions were to
                    sell the mahi mahi without incurring any losses; (2) the overstocking of mahi
                    mahi in CCUSA is to be excluded from the assessment of damages as the overstock
                    resulted from purchases of mahi mahi made prior to 1 May 2005; (3) it was
                    unreasonable to expect the defendants to sell the mahi mahi stock in days or
                    within a month; (4) the period of assessment should end on 11 July 2005
                    when the defendants were dismissed; and (5) the defendants made the effort to
                    sell the mahi mahi stock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It must be emphasized that the Court of Appeal
                        <em>did not</em> overturn the trial judge’s
                    finding of fact – that the defendants’ failure to heed to
                    LCF’s instructions resulted in the overstocking of mahi mahi and that LCF
                    was prepared to sell the mahi mahi <em>even at a loss</em>.
                    To this end, [69] of the GD is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second defendant [CHY] admitted that Lin [LCF] had expressed concern
                        about the build-up and had asked the marketing team to sell down the stock.
                        Joe Murphy [CCUSA’s National Sales Manager in the United States]
                        corroborated the evidence of Lin that he was prepared to sell <em>even at a loss</em> before prices dropped any further.
                        The second defendant, however, alleged that Lin’s instructions were to
                        sell even with no profit but without any loss. Lin denied this. <em>I prefer the evidence of Lin not only because it was
                            corroborated, but because it made better commercial sense and was more
                            credible</em>. Under those circumstances, I found that with
                        respect to overstocking the second defendant together with the first
                        defendant [CHH] breached their duty to act <em>bona
                            fide</em> in the best interests of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal, however, ordered that the inquiry of damages to
                    be assessed shall be confined to the acts of the defendants from 1 May 2005
                    onwards. Put simply, the defendants caused the overstocking of mahi mahi by not
                    listening to the LCF’s instructions (a finding of fact that was not
                    overturned by the Court of Appeal), but the assessment of damages is limited to
                    the defendants’ conduct from 1 May 2005. The defendants were
                    instructed to sell the stock of mahi mahi in November 2004, but they are only
                    liable for their failure to sell the mahi mahi from 1 May
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     With that in mind, I shall now deal with the
                    parties’ experts’ opinions. The key differences in the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Quantum of overstock</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Unlike Mr Chee who assessed the loss
                    based on the <em>entire</em> stock of mahi mahi (<em>i.e</em>. 415,155 pounds), Mr Tam set aside 200,000
                    pounds as a buffer, and treated the remaining quantity of mahi mahi (<em>i.e</em>. 213,610 pounds) held as at 1 May 2005 over and
                    above the normalized level as overstock. Mr Tam also did not include the
                    additional 1,850 pounds of mahi mahi stock which the plaintiff received in May
                    2005 as part of the overstock for the purposes of his
                quantification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I note that Mr Tam set aside 200,000
                    pounds as a buffer as he did not know the monthly stock balance and stock
                    movement of mahi mahi held by the plaintiff for the period from January 2004 to
                    August 2006 (see para 7.22 of Mr Tam’s report). I also note that the
                    plaintiff’s business is not one where it is contractually bound to
                    regularly supply its customers with mahi mahi. Accordingly, there is no need for
                    the plaintiff to have a buffer and the loss from the overstocking of mahi mahi
                    should be based on the entire stock of mahi mahi held by the plaintiff as at
                    1 May 2005 (<em>i.e</em>. 415,155
                pounds).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Quantification period</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Mr Tam’s quantification period is
                    from 1 May 2005 to 11 July 2005. According to Mr Tam, the
                    defendants no longer had control over the excess stocks after they were
                    terminated on 11 July 2005 (see para 7.15 of Mr Tam’s
                    report).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     With respect, the defendants committed serious
                    breaches and it is absurd for them to be able to rely on their termination which
                    arose out of their egregious breaches to argue that they should only be liable
                    for losses incurred up till 11 July 2005. Ramifications of the
                    defendants’ breaches would have a long term effect, which will obviously
                    extent beyond their termination date of 11 July 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The question then arises: what is a reasonable
                    time to expect the plaintiff to sell the mahi mahi from 11 July 2005? The
                    plaintiff took a total of 14 months to sell the mahi mahi, from July 2005 to
                    August 2006. However, I note that the plaintiff’s own expert was of the
                    view that five to six months would be a reasonable timeframe to sell the mahi
                    mahi. In this regard, the following exchange between Mr Lok and
                    Mr Chee is apposite:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">So, your answer to my question is that they
                                [<em>i.e</em>. the defendants] should have sold
                            much earlier and by much earlier what do you mean?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Can’t expect the stock to [be] sold within 1
                            month but it could be spread over a few months. 5-6
                        months.</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Taking that answer, wouldn’t 14 months for
                            the company to sell the stock be an unreasonable period to sell
                            them?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Yes. It appears longer than it
                        should.</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">If as you said earlier this morning, the
                            reasonable time period to clear the stock will be 5-6 months, then
                            surely the defendants ought not to be held accountable at least until
                            Nov – Dec 2005.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">I would tend to agree.</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">Q:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Fair that the defendants ought not to be held
                            responsible for decisions taken to sell after they were
                            terminated?</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">A:</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Yes and no. If the stock was sold before the
                            defendants left the company in July 2005, there will not be further
                            stock to be sold.</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Cross-examination of Mr Chee. NE of 21 July 2010 at p. 3,
                        lines 1 – 26]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect the plaintiff to have sold the
                    entire stock of mahi mahi by December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     All in all, I would have agreed with
                    Mr Tam’s calculation of the loss attributable to the defendants
                    overstocking of the mahi mahi. However, in my view, Mr Tam ought not to
                    have used July 2005 (the date the defendants were terminated from the plaintiff)
                    as the cut-off date. Accordingly, instead of applying the mahi mahi unit price
                    by Urner Barry Publications, Inc. (“<b>UB</b>”) for the month of July 2005 (as adopted by Mr Tam),
                    I applied the unit price by UB for the month of <em>December</em> 2005.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, loss from overstocking of mahi mahi is US$190,547.20
                    (189,698.71/ 413,610 X 415,460). Applying the exchange rate of 1.6693, the
                    amount in Singapore dollars is S$318,080.44.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(f)   Loss caused as a result of the need to sell stock at a loss
                to raise cash</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Lastly, in the plaintiff’s closing
                    submission, the plaintiff is seeking to introduce what is effectively a new head
                    of claim – actual losses of $1.493 million as a result of the need to sell
                    stock at a loss to raise cash. Needless to say, the defendants strenuously
                    object to the additional head of claim in their reply submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I agree with the defendants that the alleged
                    loss of S$1.493 million was never raised or hinted at in any of the AEICs. Prior
                    to the filing of the plaintiff’s closing submissions, the plaintiff had
                    only one basis and one head of claim for the loss of profits (<em>i.e</em>. the loss of profit arising from the suspension/reduction of
                    credit facilities amounting to S$2.754 million (which was subsequently revised
                    to S$2.102 million) as quantified by Mr Chee). This was the position taken
                    by the plaintiff during the assessment of damages hearing. Accordingly, I will
                    not allow this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
