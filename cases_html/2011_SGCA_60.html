        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arose out of an application by Ang
                    Boon Chye and Wong Kee Yock (“the Respondents”) for leave to apply
                    for an order of committal against Ang Tin Yong (“the Appellant”)
                    under O 52 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules of Court”). The trial judge (“the
                    Judge”) granted leave to the Respondents to apply for a committal order
                    against the Appellant. After hearing the parties, we allowed the appeal and set
                    aside the leave granted to the Respondents to apply for a committal order. We
                    now give our reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant and the Respondents were in a
                    partnership operating a food centre business known as the “All Family
                    Food Court”. The partnership comprised five partners. It made profits
                    during the years 1999 to 2004 and the profits were distributed amongst the
                    partners yearly. However, to evade tax, the partners falsified their partnership
                    accounts to declare a loss or under-declare the partnership’s income. The
                    Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) eventually found
                    out about this, and it served all the partners with Notices of Additional
                    Assessment and taxed the Respondents on the additional income
                received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondents then brought a suit in the High
                    Court against the Appellant to seek, amongst other reliefs, an account and
                    inquiry of all partnership transactions during the years 1999 to 2004 and a
                    payment of their rightful share of the partnership profits and interest on the
                    tax they had paid. In <em>Ang Boon Chye &amp; another v Ang Tin
                        Yong</em> [2008] SGHC 177, a judgment dated 21 October
                    2008, the High Court, having ruled that the Respondents were not unaware of the
                    improper practice of under-reporting to IRAS adopted by the Appellant, ordered
                    at [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-1">[T]hat an account be taken of all transactions of the
                    partnership for the period 1999 – 2004. If it is found that some partners
                    have not been paid their full share of the profits, then subject to stale claims
                    for specific sums being barred by the Limitation Act, they should be paid their
                    proper share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Thereafter the Respondents applied for an order
                    requiring the Appellant to lodge an account by 2 April 2009 in respect of
                    all partnership transactions effected for the period 1999 to 2004 and to give
                    the Respondents access to all books, vouchers, bank statements and other
                    documents in his possession which related to the accounts. On 1 December
                    2008, the Assistant Registrar granted the order (“the AR’s
                    Order”). An appeal by the Appellant against the AR’s Order was
                    dismissed by the High Court on 5 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 23 September 2010, the Respondents filed
                    a summons for leave to apply for committal against the Appellant (“the
                    Leave Application”) and a Statement pursuant to O 52 r 2(2) of
                    the Rules of Court (“the Statement”) stating the grounds in
                    support of their application. In the Statement, the Respondents averred that the
                    Appellant had failed to comply with the AR’s Order, and in the affidavit
                    filed, the Respondents affirmed that they had still not been paid their proper
                    share of the partnership profits. In response, the Appellant filed an affidavit
                    opposing the Respondents’ application stating, amongst others, that the
                    Statement was defective for lack of particulars, and that in any case the
                    Respondents had since retired from the partnership and had in a retirement deed
                    assigned away all their “share and interest” in the
                    partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At this juncture, we ought to highlight the very
                    material development in the relationship between the parties which was alluded
                    to by the Appellant in his affidavit (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above) to resist the Leave Application. This was that before the Respondents
                    made the Leave Application, they had already decided to retire from the
                    partnership and in pursuance thereof had reached a settlement with the Appellant
                    and the other two partners. Consequently, on 8 August 2009, one year before
                    the Leave Application was made, the Respondents executed a deed with the other
                    partners (“the Deed”) under which the Respondents would be deemed
                    to have retired from the partnership on 31 July 2009 and it was also
                    provided that the Respondents would, for a specified consideration, assign all
                    their shares and interest in the partnership to the continuing partners, amongst
                    whom was the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the Judge below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 8 November 2010, the Judge who heard the
                    Leave Application, granted leave to the Respondents to commence contempt
                    proceedings against the Appellant for his failure to comply with the AR’s
                    Order. In his grounds of decision, the Judge held that the Appellant had simply
                    failed to explain his failure to comply with the AR’s Order and that
                    although, pursuant to the settlement as evidenced by the Deed, the Respondents
                    had no more interest in the partnership accounts, the fact remained that the
                    Appellant had not complied with the AR’s Order. The Judge also held that
                    the Respondents’ retirement from the partnership did not release the
                    Appellant from his obligation to provide accounts as ordered and did not
                    extinguish the Respondents’ right to take action on the Appellant’s
                    failure to comply with the AR’s Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant appealed against the Judge’s
                    decision to grant leave. He argued in this appeal that the Respondents no longer
                    had any <em>locus standi</em> to obtain leave to enforce
                    the judgment they had previously obtained because they had reached an overall
                    settlement with the Appellant and the other partners on their dispute relating
                    to the partnership. Pursuant thereto, the Respondents had retired from the
                    partnership and had transferred all their shares and interest in the partnership
                    to the other continuing partners for consideration. The alternative argument
                    made by the Appellant to resist the Leave Application was that the Statement was
                    defective as it lacked particulars, having failed to specifically state the
                    exact nature of the breaches and the nature and format of the accounts required
                    to be produced under the AR’s Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Respondents had <em>locus
                    standi</em> to seek leave to commence committal proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       We will first deal with the main issue of
                    whether the Respondents lacked <em>locus standi</em> to
                    apply for leave to enforce the AR’s Order. To determine this issue, a
                    prior question to be addressed is whether the Respondents had, under the Deed,
                    assigned away all their rights and interest in the partnership. If the
                    Respondents had indeed so assigned away their rights and interest in the
                    partnership, the next question would be whether it necessarily followed that
                    they no longer had the <em>locus standi</em> to seek leave
                    to commence committal proceedings against the Appellant. At this juncture, it
                    would be appropriate to set out the pertinent clauses of the Deed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. A balance sheet as at the Succession Date [<em>ie</em>, 31 July 2009] and a profit and loss account from
                        the date when the last partnership account was taken to the Succession Date
                        shall be prepared by the partnership as soon as reasonably possible after
                        the Succession Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. Any undrawn balance of the Outgoing Partners’ share of the net
                        profits of the partnership for the period since the date when the last
                        partnership account was taken to the Succession Date ... be paid to the
                        Outgoing Partners in accordance with their share in the Partnership within
                        seven {7} days ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4. In consideration of the price of SGD 150,000.00 to be paid to each of
                        the Outgoing Partners in the manner provided for in Clause 5 hereof the
                        Outgoing Partners hereby assign to the Continuing Partners all the share and
                        interest of the Outgoing Partners of and in the goodwill book debts and
                        credits and all property of or belonging to the parties hereto in connection
                        with the partnership to hold unto the Continuing Partners in equal
                        shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     What is the intent and scope of the Deed? This
                    would, of course, depend on the proper construction of the document. In
                        <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior
                        Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029
                        (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) this court
                    had the occasion to consider the principles governing the construction of
                    contracts and it endorsed (at [131]) the following principles set out by Gerard
                    McMeel, <em>The Construction of Contracts: Interpretation,
                        Implication and Rectification</em> (Oxford University Press, 2007) at
                    paras 1.124–1.133:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The aim of construction</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the aim of the exercise of construction of a contract or other
                        document is to ascertain the meaning which it would convey to a reasonable
                        business person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The objective
                principle</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the <em>objective
                            principle</em> is therefore critical in defining the approach the
                        courts will take. They are concerned usually with the expressed intentions
                        of a person, not his or her actual intentions. The standpoint adopted is
                        that of a reasonable reader. [See in this regard the earlier discussion at
                        [125]–[127] above].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The holistic or ‘whole
                            contract’ approach</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, the exercise is one based on the <em>whole contract</em> or an <em>holistic
                            approach</em>. Courts are not excessively focused upon a
                        particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause. Rather the emphasis is on the
                        document or utterance as a whole. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The contextual
                            dimension</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, the exercise in construction is informed by
                        the <em>surrounding circumstances</em> or <em>external context</em>. Modern judges are prepared to look
                        beyond the four corners of a document, or the bare words of an utterance. It
                        is permissible to have regard to the <em>legal, regulatory,
                            and factual matrix</em> which constitutes the background in which
                                the document was drafted or the utterance was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Business
                                    purpose</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fifthly, within this framework due consideration is given to the <em>commercial purpose</em> of the transaction or provision.
                        The courts have regard to the overall purpose of the parties with respect to
                        a particular transaction, or more narrowly the reason why a particular
                        obligation was undertaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Avoiding unreasonable
                            results</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Eighthly, a construction which leads to very
                        unreasonable results is to be avoided unless it is required by clear words
                        and there is no other tenable construction. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Clearly, an objective approach must be taken
                    to determine the intentions of the contracting parties as expressed in the
                    document. What must be sought is the meaning that the contract conveys to a
                    reasonable person having the background knowledge that would have been
                    reasonably available to him. A holistic approach must be taken and regard must
                    also be had to the commercial purpose of the contract and circumstances in which
                    the contract was made (see Kim Lewison, <em>The Interpretation of
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2007) at paras 2.02,
                    2.03 and 2.07).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Deed was an agreement between the parties
                    (plus two other persons who were partners in the partnership) who were in a
                    commercial relationship. It was clear from a perusal of the Deed that its object
                    was to effect a clean break of the partnership relationship between the
                    continuing partners and the outgoing partners. Construing the Deed in such a
                    manner would accord with business common sense and its commercial purposes. In
                        <em>Mannai Investment Co v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [1997] AC 749, Lord Steyn endorsed such an approach
                    to interpreting commercial contracts. He stated at 771:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In determining the meaning of the language of a
                            commercial contract, ... the law therefore generally favours a
                            commercially sensible construction. The reason for this approach is that
                            a commercial construction is more likely to give effect to the intention
                            of the parties.</em> Words are therefore interpreted in the way in
                        which a reasonable commercial person would construe them. And the standard
                        of the reasonable commercial person is hostile to technical interpretations
                        and undue emphasis on niceties of language. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was not in dispute that the balance sheet
                    and the profit and loss account envisaged under cl 2 of the Deed had been
                    prepared and furnished to the parties to the Deed. No issue had been raised that
                    the payment which was required to be made to the outgoing partners under
                    cl 3 had been effected. Clause 4 of the Deed expressly stated that in
                    consideration of the payment of $150,000 to each of the Respondents, the
                    Respondents would assign all their “share and interest of ... and in the
                    goodwill book debts and credits and all property of or belonging to the parties
                    ... in connection with the partnership”, to the continuing partners
                    (which included the Appellant). While we would not say that this clause is a
                    model of clarity, it is nevertheless apparent, on a plain reading of those
                    underscored words, that upon receipt of the payment of $150,000 by each of the
                    Respondents, they would have no more rights or interest in the partnership
                    accounts or assets. Keeping in mind the object of the arrangement encapsulated
                    in the Deed, it would follow that whatever interest the Respondents might have
                    in pursuing the AR’s order would have been subsumed under the settlement
                    accord set out in the Deed. To suggest that after the Deed had been executed the
                    Respondents still retained some interest in the partnership assets or accounts,
                    would go against good commercial sense and the plain terms of the
                Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The duty to disclose and render accounts of
                    partnership transactions arises out of the fiduciary relationship which exists
                    between partners (see Yeo Hwee Ying, <em>Partnership Law in
                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2000) at p 174). This right is in
                    fact reflected in s 28 of the Partnership Act (Cap 391, Rev Ed
                    1994). Partners can institute an action against other partners to obtain an
                    account of transactions concerning the partnership. Also, in <em>Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th
                    Ed, 1995) at para 23-75, Lord Lindley wrote: “[t]he right of every
                    partner to have an account from his co-partners of their dealings and
                    transaction is too obvious to require comment.” Therefore, an order for
                    an account of partnership transactions is a relief sought as between <em>partners</em>. At the time when the AR’s Order was
                    made, the Respondents were still partners (together with the Appellant and two
                    others) of the partnership and had an interest in the accounts and assets of the
                    partnership. Up to that point, the Respondents would have been entitled to
                    enforce the AR’s Order by way of an application for committal. However,
                    upon retiring from the partnership and assigning all their rights and interest
                    in it for consideration as set out in the Deed, the Respondents would have had
                    no more interest in the partnership accounts or property. Neither would they
                    have any more interest in enforcing the AR’s Order. To grant leave to
                    enable the Respondents to enforce the AR’s Order in such circumstances
                    would be an exercise in futility and in breach of the spirit of the Deed, and
                    indeed of an implied term of the Deed. The two oft-cited tests applied to
                    determine if a term should be implied into a contract are the “business
                    efficacy” test set out in <em>The Moorcock</em>
                    (1889) LR 14 PD 64 at 68 and the “officious bystander” test set
                    out in <em>Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd</em>
                    [1939] 2 KB 206 at 227. The former would imply a term if it was necessary to
                    give efficacy to a contract while the latter would imply a term if it was so
                    obviously a stipulation in the agreement that parties must have intended it to
                    form part of their contract (see <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) at
                    paras 13-005 and 13-007). Both these tests are complementary (see <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil
                        Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em>
                    [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at [11]). We had no doubt that at the time the Deed was entered
                    into by the parties, if an officious bystander were to suggest that they include
                    an express provision providing that the AR’s Order be extinguished upon
                    execution of the Deed, their unified response would have been “oh, of
                    course”. Likewise it cannot be disputed that this term would be necessary
                    to give business efficacy to the Deed. Implying such a term would accord with
                    the parties’ intentions when they entered into the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We noted the Respondents’ argument that
                    although they had assigned their shares and interest in the partnership pursuant
                    to cl 4 of the Deed, they did not assign or waive their rights under the
                    AR’s Order that an account be taken of the partnership transactions
                    between 1999 and 2004. But having regard to the Deed, what purpose would the
                    taking of accounts serve as the Respondents had no more interest in the
                    partnership? The Respondents seemed to be arguing that they still retained the
                    right to enforce the AR’s Order notwithstanding the settlement accord
                    reflected in the Deed. The Judge would appear to have also taken this view. In
                    our opinion, this approach is flawed because it looked only at the form rather
                    than the substance of the matter. We would reiterate: the Respondents had no
                    more interest in the partnership accounts and assets. The persons who
                    collectively had all the interest in the accounts and assets of the partnership
                    were not asking that an account be taken in respect of the transactions effected
                    by the partnership between 1999 and 2004. For the Respondents, one year after
                    the settlement had been reached, to seek to enforce the AR’s Order by way
                    of contempt smacked of bad faith. The court would not allow its process to be
                    used for such an improper collateral purpose. That the court retains an inherent
                    jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of its processes has been established by this
                    court in <em>Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man</em>
                    [2008] 4 SLR(R) 348 at [22] (“<em>Lai Shit
                        Har</em>”). The court in <em>Lai Shit
                        Har</em> affirmed the view in <em>Chee Siok Chin v
                        Minister for Home Affairs</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [34]
                        (“<em>Chee Siok Chin</em>”) that it would
                    amount to a clear abuse of process where “the <em>process
                        of the court is not being fairly or honestly used but is employed instead
                        for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper
                    way</em>” [emphasis in original]. <em>Chee Siok
                        Chin</em> was followed by this court in <em>NCC
                        International AB v Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 565 at [71].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We will now briefly address the cases relied
                    upon by the parties. The authority of <em>Kuo
                        </em><em>Ching </em><em>Yun and
                        another v H &amp; L Investments Holding Pte Ltd</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 276   (“<em>Kuo
                        </em><em>Ching </em><em>Yun</em>”) was cited by the Appellant. However, we did not
                    think that <em>Kuo </em><em>Ching
                        </em><em>Yun</em> was of much assistance as in
                    that case there was no clause like cl 4 of the Deed. Further, unlike in the
                    present case where the assignment was made in writing, in <em>Kuo
                        </em><em>Ching </em><em>Yun</em>, the assignment was oral and what arose for consideration
                    were issues relating to the form of that assignment. On the other hand, the
                    Respondents relied on the authority of <em>Hawthorn v
                        Smallcorn</em> [1998] STC 591 (“<em>Hawthorn</em>”) where the assignment by a retired partner of
                    his share in the partnership arewas found <em>not</em> to
                    have encompassed his right to claim a share of a repayment of overpaid value
                    added tax while he was still a partner. Even though the decision in <em>Hawthorn</em> would appear to be at variance from that taken
                    by us in this case, all we need say is that, as was rightly recognised by the
                    judge in <em>Hawthorn</em>, ultimately it was all a a
                    matter of construing the effect of the relevant clause or clauses in the
                    retirement deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the aforesaid reasons, we were unable,
                    with respect, to agree with the Judge who held that the Respondents were still
                    entitled to obtain leave to enforce the AR’s Order. The Respondents no
                    longer had any interest in the partnership accounts or assets and thus no longer
                    had the <em>locus standi</em> to apply for leave to enforce
                    the AR’s Order. This sufficiently disposes of the matter and there is no
                    need for us to address the second issue raised by the Appellant concerning the
                    sufficiency of particularisation of the Statement filed by the Respondents in
                    the Leave Application (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the result, we allowed the appeal and set
                    aside the leave granted by the Judge to the Respondents to enforce the
                    AR’s Order. Upon hearing the parties on costs, we fixed costs of the
                    appeal at the sum of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements. Subsequently, counsel
                    for the Appellant wrote in and drew our attention to the fact that the costs
                    below had been reserved and that a significant amount had been incurred in
                    relation to disbursements for this appeal. Although we allowed counsel to be
                    heard a second time on costs and adjusted the costs order accordingly, we
                    reminded counsel on the need to exercise greater care in submitting matters for
                    the consideration of the court.</p>
