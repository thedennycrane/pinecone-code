<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This originating summons is one of two appeals
                    arising out of arbitration proceedings between Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co
                    Ltd (“STEC”) and Econ-NCC Joint Venture (“ENJV”)
                    which resulted in a partial award dated 29 December 2008 (“Partial
                    Award”) and a correction award dated 28 January 2009
                    (“Correction Award”). Both parties were dissatisfied with certain
                    aspects of the arbitrator’s decision, albeit on different grounds, and
                    therefore agreed pursuant to s 49(3)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to
                    appeal to the court on the questions of law they considered to arise from the
                    decision. This originating summons (“OS 226/2009”) is STEC’s
                    appeal and ENJV’s appeal is encompassed in Originating Summons No 235
                    of 2009 (“OS 235/2009”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       STEC is a Chinese public company which carries
                    out engineering and construction activities. At all material times during its
                    dealings with STEC, ENJV was a joint-venture registered in Singapore as a
                    partnership between a Singapore construction company, Econ Corporation Pte. Ltd
                    (now known as Econ Piling Pte Ltd) (“ECON”), and a Swedish
                    company, NCC International Aktiebolag. By the time OS 235/2009 was filed, the
                    joint-venture had been terminated. As both sets of proceedings relate to events
                    that occurred during the subsistence of the joint-venture, however, it is
                    convenient to refer to ENJV rather than to the individual
                partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties were engaged in works relating to
                    the construction of part of the Circle Line of the Mass Rapid Transit System.
                    ENJV was the main contractor employed by the Land Transport Authority
                    (“LTA”) and it in turn employed STEC as a sub-contractor for part
                    of the works. The disputes that arose subsequently were, in accordance with the
                    contract, referred to arbitration by a sole arbitrator, Mr George Tan
                    (“the Arbitrator”). STEC was the claimant in the arbitration but
                    ENJV both defended the proceedings and put in a counter-claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The main contract between LTA and ENJV was dated
                    1 August 2002 (“Main Contract”). It was ENJV’s task to
                    construct and complete the MRT stations at MacPherson and Upper Paya Lebar as
                    well as the tunnels at this section of the Circle Line (“Main Contract
                    works”). There were 13 phases under the Main Contract. In Phase 3, the
                    basic structure of the rail tunnels should have been completed. The completion
                    date stipulated in the Main Contract for Phase 3 was 31 December
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By a Letter of Award dated 5 December 2002
                    (“LA”), STEC was awarded a sub-contract by ENJV for the bored
                    tunnelling works in Phase 3 of the Main Contract at the price of $20,172,966.00
                    (“Sub-Contract”). By virtue of cl 2.0 of the LA, the
                    following documents were incorporated into the Sub-Contract:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The LA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">General Terms and Conditions for Domestic
                            Subcontract Work (“GTC”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Main Contractor’s Programme, referred to in
                            the arbitration proceedings as the “22B3
                            Programme”.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Broadly speaking, the works under the Sub-Contract (“the
                    Sub-Contract works”) comprised tunnelling works for both north-bound
                    (“NB”) and south-bound (“SB”) tunnels, including the
                    installation of precast reinforced concrete segments in strict compliance with,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the 22B3 Programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The commencement and completion dates for the
                    Sub-Contract works were stipulated at cl 4.0 of the LA as 15 December
                    2002 and 31 December 2004 respectively. In particular, STEC was to complete
                    the installation of tunnelling works including First Stage Concrete by
                    16 November 2004. As the issues arising in this appeal relate to the
                    completion of the Sub-Contract works, the clauses in the LA and GTC which are
                    pertinent to completion are reproduced below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 4.0 of the LA
                        states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">

                                December 2004</b>. However, the completion dates for each
                            part or section of the Domestic Subcontract Works shall be in accordance
                            with the Main Contractor’s Programme as revised from time to time
                            or as instructed by the Main Contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In particular the Domestic Subcontractor shall complete the
                            installation of the tunnelling works (last segment lining) including
                            First Stage Concrete by <b>16 Nov 04</b>. The
                            Domestic Subcontractor shall then demobilize within 2 weeks, all plant,
                            equipment, tools, surplus materials, temporary works out of the tunnels
                            &amp; shafts including cleaning the tunnels and shafts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In the event of a revision of the Main Contractor’s Programme,
                            the original duration of the programmed activity of the Domestic
                            Subcontractor shall not be diminished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 17.0
                        of the LA provides for completion, delay and time extension as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Domestic Subcontractor is fully aware that liquidated damages for
                            the Basic Structure Completion in the Main Contract is $49,000 per day
                            and Completion of the Whole of the Main Contract Works is $66,000 per
                            day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In the event that the Domestic Subcontractor delays the completion of
                            the tunnelling works beyond the 16 November 2004, the Main Contractor

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Pursuant to cl 9.0 of the LA and Appendix V
                    of the GTC, ENJV was to complete preparatory works before STEC could carry out
                    the boring works. These preparatory works included:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">design and construction of launch
                        shaft;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">construction and preparation of launch shaft
                            surface area for STEC to construct the crane foundation and to assemble
                            the gantry crane; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">casting of base slab in the launch shaft and
                            removal of temporary struts to enable STEC to lower the tunnel boring
                            machine (“TBM”) cradle into the launch shaft and assemble
                            the TBM cradle and the TBM.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Based on the 22B3 programme, the dates for
                    handing over of the SB and NB launch shafts to STEC for commencement of work
                    were 24 April 2003 and 8 May 2003 respectively. Tunnelling works for
                    SB and NB tunnels were to be carried out concurrently. The sequence of works was
                    to be as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Assemble TBM on site C7, complete SB Drive B1,
                            then dismantle TBM and transport it to site C4.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Assemble TBM on site C4, complete SB Drive B2,
                            dismantle TBM and transport it to site C3.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Assemble TBM on site C3, complete SB Drive B3,
                            and south-bound tunnelling works and final dismantling of the
                            TBM.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For various reasons, ENJV could not complete the
                    requisite preparatory works according to schedule. The SB launch shaft was
                    handed over to STEC on 27 June 2003 whilst the NB shaft was handed over on
                    11 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     STEC alleged that the late handover of the
                    launch shafts by ENJV entitled it to 84 days of extension of time. This was
                    disputed by ENJV, which claimed that despite the late handover of the launch
                    shaft, STEC had not commenced installation of its site offices and had not
                    mobilised the necessary labour and resources to commence the Sub-Contract works
                    as at the date of actual handover of the launch shafts. Thus, the late
                    commencement of the Sub-Contract works could not be wholly attributable to the
                    delay in the handover of the launch shafts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Ostensibly to alleviate these problems, STEC
                    and ENJV entered into an agreement on 26 July 2003 which both parties
                    referred to as the second supplemental agreement
                        (“2<sup>nd</sup> SA”). Under the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA, ENJV was to advance to STEC $1,008,648.30
                    as an out-of-sequence progress payment for sums invoiced by STEC’s
                    sub-contractors in respect of equipment procured from such sub-contractors
                        (<em>eg</em>, locomotives, gantry cranes, liquid grout,
                    ventilation equipment and muck cars) as well as for general expenses incurred by
                    STEC. Clause 1.2 (ix) stated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA did
                    not relieve STEC of its obligation to furnish a performance bond as required
                    under the Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Two clauses of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA bear quoting:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 20 May 2005, STEC gave notice to ENJV
                    of its intention to commence arbitration proceedings pursuant to cl 32 of
                    the GTC. STEC’s position was that it was not at fault for failing to meet
                    the contractual deadlines but was entitled to extensions of time while ENJV
                    disputed this and claimed that the delay in the completion of the Sub-Contract
                    works had caused it substantial loss for which STEC should be held liable. There
                    was also a dispute over whether ENJV was entitled to withhold certain monies
                    from STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arbitration proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 6 December 2005, STEC made an
                    application to the Arbitrator for an interim award to be made summarily in its
                    favour. This application was dismissed on 3 April 2006 by the
                    Arbitrator’s interim award (“Interim Award”). Following this
                    decision, STEC re-amended its statement of case.</p>

                    was completed on 24 May 2007. Thereafter, both parties filed closing
                    submissions and written replies to the same. The Arbitrator subsequently granted
                    the parties leave to make further submissions and the fifth and final set of
                    submissions from ENJV was received on 14 August 2008. On 15 December
                    2008, the Arbitrator denied ENJV’s request to put in a sixth set of
                    submissions and declared the close of the hearing of the arbitration. He issued
                    the Partial Award on 29 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In January 2009, solicitors for both STEC and

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">STEC’s Questions of Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The questions of law raised by STEC in OS
                    226/2009 relate to the following findings of the Arbitrator:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Substantial completion of the
                        Sub-Contract works was effected on 8 March 2005;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     STEC was allowed 44 days extension of
                        time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     DLP (i.e.
                        the Defects Liability Period) commenced on 8 March 2005, 112 days after
                        16 November 2004; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     That he would make no order in respect of ENJV’s
                        claim for reimbursement of $10,682,000 being ENJV’s alleged liability
                        to LTA for delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These questions have been described by
                    STEC as the “Complete Decision” question and the
                    “Commercial Purpose – Reciprocity” question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Complete Decision question is whether the
                    Arbitrator was obliged to and has rendered a complete decision in respect of all
                    issues which were referred to him for resolution. It arises in relation to
                    ENJV’s claim for damages allegedly caused by STEC’s delay in
                    completing the Sub-Contract works. It is STEC’s position that the
                    Arbitrator has not rendered a complete decision in relation to this claim
                    notwithstanding the fact that this was a matter which the parties had referred
                    to him for his determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Commercial Purpose – Reciprocity
                    question is whether in relation to the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, the
                    Arbitrator has considered all relevant factors permissible in law in arriving at
                    his decision and whether the principles in the cases of <em>Yamashita Tetsuo v See Hup Seng Ltd</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 265 (“<em>Yamashita</em>”)
                    and <em>Gay Choong Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and Another
                        Appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<em>Gay Choong Ing</em>”) have any application in determining the
                    intent and true effect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA which was to
                    reach a compromise between the parties arising from the late handover of the
                    Sub-Contract works by ENJV to STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Complete Decision question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As stated, the Complete Decision question
                    arises in relation to ENJV’s counterclaim. It had sought the following
                    reliefs pursuant to cll 17 or 18 of the GTC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">118.1 an order that STEC is to pay ENJV all loss and
                            damage incurred or to be incurred by ENJV to the LTA which is
                            attributable to STEC’s delay in completing the Subcontract works.
                            As at the date of this Counterclaim, ENJV’s assessment of such
                            loss and/or damage stands at <b><u>S$10,682,000.00</u></b> on the basis only of the liquidated
                            damages that ENJV is liable to LTA arising from the
                        delays;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">118.2 a declaration that STEC is obliged to reimburse
                            ENJV for any further liquidated damages imposed by the LTA on ENJV under
                            the Main Contract over and above the <b><u>S$10,682,000.00</u></b> claimed, in the event the LTA succeeds
                            in showing that the B1, B2 and/or B3 tunnels had not been substantially
                            completed on 16 August 2005; …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">ENJV’s claim therefore was for $10,682,000 to be paid
                    immediately and a declaration that STEC was liable for sums above that amount in
                    the event that further liquidated damages were imposed by LTA in the future.
                    ENJV did not include as part of its pleading an alternative prayer that the
                    quantum of loss and damage under this head of claim be assessed by the
                    Arbitrator or deferred for determination by another forum or
                tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     ENJV’s claim for $10,682,000 was
                    premised on its own liability to LTA under the Main Contract in liquidated
                    damages for 218 days of delay (from 11 January 2005 to 16 August 2005)
                    at the rate of $49,000 per day. ENJV had obtained 10 days’ extension of
                    time from LTA, so the date of completion for Phase 3 was extended to
                    10 January 2005. Its position in the counterclaim was that STEC had only
                    substantially completed the Sub-Contract works on 16 August
                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Arbitrator found (at para 447 of the
                    Partial Award) that in order to hold STEC liable under this counterclaim, the
                    following requirements had to be satisfied:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There must be a delay to the completion of the
                            Sub-Contract works;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">STEC must have caused delay to the Sub-Contract
                            works;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The delay to the Sub-Contract must result in
                            delay to the completion of the Main Contract works; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">ENJV must suffer or incur losses and damages as a
                            result of this delay.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">He was satisfied on the evidence that (a), (b) and (c) had been
                    satisfied (he found STEC liable for 68 days of delay).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     He then went on to consider the loss and
                    damage allegedly suffered by ENJV. At para 474 of the Partial Award, the
                    Arbitrator held that although actual payment to LTA or deduction by LTA was not
                    necessary before ENJV could recover the same against STEC, it was still
                    necessary to establish what the loss or damage suffered or incurred by ENJV had
                    been; it was not enough to show that LTA had a “viable claim”
                    against ENJV in liquidated damages. Therefore, it was necessary for ENJV to
                    establish its liability to LTA first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     He rejected ENJV’s argument that
                    ENJV’s liability to LTA was established since liquidated damages were
                    payable once the contract completion date had passed. Such an argument, he held,
                    ignored consideration of any extension of time that may be given by LTA or that
                    ENJV may be entitled to. He found that ENJV had not placed any evidence before
                    him as to whether it had asked for any extension of time or of the duration
                    asked for in relation to the Phase 3 works or the Main Contract works. In
                    particular, there was no evidence of any contract supervisor’s or
                    superintending officer’s evaluation or assessment of the quantum of
                    liquidated damages supposedly payable to LTA by ENJV under the Main Contract.
                    Therefore, the Arbitrator was not persuaded that ENJV had established its
                    liability to LTA for liquidated damages. In particular, he found that on the
                    evidence before him, ENJV had failed to establish the loss or damages amounting
                    to $10,682,000 that it sought to recover from STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Arbitrator noted (at para 480 of the
                    Partial Award) that ENJV, perhaps anticipating the outcome, had proposed that
                    what it described as “an assessment of the quantum of liability”
                    could be “reserved until such time” as the Arbitrator thought fit
                    and in the meantime, he should nevertheless rule in favour of ENJV and declare
                    STEC liable to compensate ENJV for ENJV’s liability to LTA in respect of
                    delays to the completion of the Main Contract works. The Arbitrator refused to
                    do this. He held it was necessary for ENJV’s liability to LTA for
                    liquidated damages and the amount of such damages to be established before it
                    could recover the same from STEC. This was not an assessment of quantum but an
                    establishment of liability. Failing this, ENJV may well be entitled to only
                    nominal damages. Secondly, he was not convinced he had the same jurisdiction as
                    the court to defer an inquiry as to damages to an indefinite date in the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having said this, the Arbitrator did not award
                    nominal damages or dismiss the counterclaim. Instead, he proposed that
                    ENJV’s counterclaim be resolved by another forum or tribunal. He said at
                    para 486 of the Partial Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">ENJV can consider seeking and pursuing, before the appropriate forum or
                        tribunal, any action, inquiry, proceedings or assessment that may be
                        appropriate to establish and quantify the loss and damages (if any) that it
                        contends result from STEC’s delay. <em>Until then, ENJV
                            has suffered no loss or damages for which it needs to be compensated. In
                            the circumstances, I make no order or direction on the sum of
                            S$10,682,000.00 claimed by ENJV under this head of claim</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He further held at para 584.2 of the Partial Award that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nothing in this award shall prohibit ENJV from seeking or pursuing, before
                        the appropriate forum or tribunal, any action, inquiry, proceedings or
                        assessment that may be appropriate and competent to establish and quantify
                        the loss and damages (if any) that it contends result from STEC’s
                        delay; …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is these paragraphs of the Partial Award
                    that have aroused STEC’s ire. It submitted that it is a basic principle
                    that a tribunal must determine all issues raised for its determination and may
                    not leave any claim unresolved or delegate the same to a third party for
                    consideration. An award should be “final” insofar as parties ought
                    to be able to discern their respective obligations and liabilities from it
                    without having to go to any other source.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Responding to these arguments, ENJV emphasised
                    that the Arbitrator had found STEC to be in delay and that such delay must have
                    caused delay to the Main Contract works. It cited para 448 of the Partial
                    Award which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">448.  Except for some issues relating to the duration
                            of the delay, there is no dispute that there was in fact delay to the
                            completion of the Sub-Contract Works. <em>It is not
                                disputable that delay to the Sub-Contract must result in delay to
                                the completion of the Main Contract Works</em>. What is in
                            dispute are (a) STEC’s culpability for the delay and (b) the loss
                            and damages alleged to be suffered by ENJV. In other words, <em>the argument for STEC is that the requirements set out in
                                paragraphs 447.2 and 447.4 above have not been met</em>.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     ENJV pointed out that under cl 17 of the
                    GTC, if delay in the Sub-Contract works resulted in delay to the completion of
                    the Main Contract works, then STEC would have to pay or allow to ENJV a sum
                    equivalent to any loss or damage incurred by ENJV which was attributable to the
                    delay caused by the Sub-Contract works. In its counterclaim, ENJV had only
                    claimed damages from STEC on the liquidated damages payable to LTA due to delay
                    in completion of Phase 3 of the Main Contract works which was calculated at the
                    rate of $49,000 per day. It had not claimed damages for delay in completion of
                    the Main Contract works which were calculated at the rate of $66,000 per
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Regarding liability to LTA, ENJV repeated the
                    submission that it had made to the Arbitrator that such liability for liquidated
                    damages had accrued once the extended Phase 3 Basic Structure Completion Date,
                        <em>ie</em>,10 January 2005, had passed. It asserted
                    that it had sufficiently pleaded the relief sought by asking for a ruling by the
                    Arbitrator that STEC be ordered to pay ENJV the sum of $10,682,000 “being
                    a reasonable assessment” of ENJV’s liability to LTA arising out of
                    STEC’s delay. The substantive relief having been claimed, it did not
                    matter whether the assessment took place or was deferred; STEC would still have
                    to pay damages to ENJV. Even if STEC was correct <em>ie</em>, that the deferment of the assessment of damages ought to be
                    prayed for, the Arbitrator was not precluded from ordering further relief. Under
                    s 34 (2) of the Act, the arbitral tribunal may award any relief or remedy
                    that could have been ordered by the court in civil proceedings before it and, as
                    noted in Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Civil Practice in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at para [138], “[t]he
                    court is not restricted in its power to grant relief by the remedies pleaded,
                    and may grant alternative or additional relief if this is justified by the
                    facts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     ENJV submitted that after the Arbitrator made
                    his declaration that STEC was liable for 68 days of delay, he was empowered to
                    make a direction for any loss and damages incurred by reason of STEC’s
                    delay to be assessed at a later date. This power came from s 34 (2) of the Act
                    as well as from Rule 22.3 of the Domestic Arbitration Rules of the Singapore
                    International Arbitration Centre (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1 September
                    2002) (“SIAC Rules”) (which, as agreed by the parties, applied to
                    the arbitration) which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal otherwise has the widest discretion within the law to give
                        orders and directions in respect of or in connection with the arbitration
                        and for the just, expeditions, economical and final determination of the
                        dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my opinion, ENJV’s submissions do not
                    deal with the essential point of this part of the Partial Award. The Arbitrator
                    had, correctly in my view, directed himself that it was not sufficient to find
                    STEC in delay and that such delay resulted in the delay of the Main Contract
                    works. In order for ENJV’s counterclaim to succeed, it had to show that
                    its potential liability to LTA arising from such delay had been translated into
                    an actual liability. The Arbitrator found as a matter of fact that the evidence
                    before him did not establish such actual liability. Therefore, he could not
                    award ENJV any relief for the same whether in the amount of $10,682,000 or in
                    the amount of $3,332,000 (representing 68 days of delay at $49,000 per day) or
                    in any other amount. The powers of the Arbitrator under s 34 (2) of the Act and
                    Rule 22.3 of the SIAC Rules relate to reliefs that can be granted after
                    liability has been established. Since the Arbitrator could not establish
                    liability on the evidence before him, there was no question of granting any
                    relief whether deferred or otherwise and therefore these provisions do not
                    assist ENJV. The question of law that STEC had raised was whether the Arbitrator
                    was entitled to allow ENJV another bite of the cherry by not dismissing its
                    claim but instead stating that ENJV could pursue a further action before a
                    different tribunal or forum to establish its liability to LTA and therefore
                    STEC’s liability to it. This question was not really dealt with by ENJV. I
                    now turn to it.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Ronly Holdings Ltd v JSC
                        Zestafoni G Nikoladze Ferroalloy Plant</em> [2004]
                    1 CLC 1168 (“<em>Ronly
                    Holdings</em>”), the claimant applied for relief against an
                    arbitral award in which the respondent was ordered to pay to the claimant a sum
                    less than the amount claimed as due and payable under the agreement in question.
                    The arbitrator had taken account of amounts for which the claimant had
                    previously been willing to give credit under other contracts with the respondent
                    (“the shortfall amount”). The respondent objected, with the
                    claimant’s agreement, to the arbitrator’s consideration of these
                    other contracts and the pleadings were amended to delete all references to the
                    same. Despite finding that the respondent was liable to pay the full sum due
                    under the agreement forming the subject-matter of the arbitration, the
                    arbitrator directed that the sum immediately payable to the claimant should be
                    the contractual sum less the shortfall amount. On appeal, Gross J granted the
                    application, holding that the arbitrator had wrongly left the matter of the
                    shortfall amount in limbo. The exact terms of the arbitrator’s
                    determination were as follows (quoted in <em>Ronly
                        Holdings</em>, at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50.    … my jurisdiction is constrained by the
                            terms of the … Agreement, and by the terms of my appointment,
                            and, accordingly, I can make no determination binding upon the parties
                            concerning the sums in respect of which the Claimants were previously
                            prepared to give credit. So far as the directory part of my Award is
                            concerned, however, I propose to take those sums into account, leaving
                            it to the parties to resolve by other means any outstanding differences
                            that may remain concerning the contracts and arrangements from which
                            they were derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    … I can now summarise the sums outstanding
                            under the … Agreement …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Total] US$16,083,772.40</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52.    According to their (unamended) Points of Claim,
                            the Claimants had been willing to give credit for the total sum of
                            US$5,994,937.83 [the shortfall amount]. I shall therefore direct that
                            the capital sum immediately payable to the Claimants by the Respondents
                            amounts to US$10,088,834.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Gross J (at [23]) referred to the principles set out in
                        <em>Russell on Arbitration</em> (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above) and held that the arbitral award could
                    not stand (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pulling the threads together, the arbitrator was appointed to determine
                        the issues arising on the reference. On one view, he has failed to deal with
                        an issue put to him, namely, the fate of the shortfall amount.
                        Alternatively, having determined the sums outstanding under the agreement,
                        he has taken upon himself a power to withhold payment of the shortfall
                        amount pending a resolution of its fate by the parties or third parties. On
                        either analysis the award cannot stand; the right answer, in the light of
                        what had gone before in the arbitration, is that the arbitrator ought to
                        have gone on to order payment of the shortfall amount to Ronly [<em>ie</em>, the claimant].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On the present facts, as the Arbitrator had
                    decided not to make any order or direction on ENJV’s counterclaim for
                    $10,682,000, he has effectively left the determination of that head of
                    counterclaim to be resolved by some future forum or tribunal. This is despite
                    his finding at para 484 of the Partial Award that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am of the view that the real question is not whether I am empowered to
                        grant the relief sought (i.e. to direct an inquiry or assessment to be held
                        at a later date) but whether I can defer the inquiry or assessment to an
                        indefinite date in the future, leaving me with an open-ended jurisdiction
                        over the dispute (or part of the dispute) that continues into the unknown
                        future. Even if I have such a power (<em>which I find I do
                            not</em>), I am not prepared to exercise it under the present
                        circumstances. There is not enough tangible information, much less, evidence
                        available to me to enable me to make a reasonable judgment when such an
                        inquiry or assessment can take place. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although he found that he had no power to defer the inquiry or
                    assessment of STEC’s liability to ENJV for $10,682,000, he also found that
                    until such assessment is carried out to establish and quantify the loss and
                    damages (if any), ENJV had suffered <em>no</em> loss or
                    damages for which it needed to be compensated. This went against his decision
                        <em>not</em> to make any order or direction on
                    ENJV’s counterclaim for $10,682,000. Since he had found that, on the
                    evidence before him, ENJV had failed to establish any loss or damage for which
                    it should be compensated by STEC, he should have dismissed the counterclaim
                    instead of making no order or direction with respect to this head of
                    ENJV’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Accordingly, I find in relation to the first
                    question of law that the Arbitrator did not render a complete decision in
                    respect of all issues that were referred to him for arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Commercial Purpose – Reciprocity question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The parties entered into the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA to vary the terms of the Sub-Contract. The
                    question raised by this issue of law relates to the true construction of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA and whether the Arbitrator should have
                    construed it as a compromise agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the Partial Award, the Arbitrator found
                    that under the terms of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, STEC had waived
                    its claims against ENJV for, <em>inter alia</em>, extension
                    of time. Therefore, he found that STEC was not entitled to the 84 days’
                    extension of time which STEC had claimed in respect of ENJV’s late
                    handover of the launch shafts. STEC had claimed that the late handover was one
                    of the delaying events which should entitle it to an extension of
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     STEC contended that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA is in effect a compromise agreement
                    between STEC and ENJV. Thus, it submitted, the Arbitrator had failed to give
                    proper consideration to the commercial purpose of such a compromise agreement.
                    According to STEC, if the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA resulted in its
                    waiving its claim for 84 days’ extension of time against ENJV, then the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA should also have the reciprocal result
                    that ENJV had waived its claims against STEC for damages in respect of 84
                    days’ delay to the completion of the Sub-Contract works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In response, ENJV maintained that as the
                    language of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was clear and unambiguous, the
                    factual matrix leading up to the execution of the agreement was not a relevant
                    consideration. In any event, the factual matrix would show that the
                        2<sup>n</sup><sup>d </sup>SA was not meant to be a compromise agreement.
                    Thus, the Arbitrator was correct in finding that in entering into the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA, STEC had assumed the risks of any delay
                    to the Sub-Contract works by events prior to the date of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA, <em>viz</em>, 26
                    July 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In view of my finding on the Complete Decision
                    question, the second question of law has been rendered academic. Even if I
                    decided the second question in favour of STEC, it would not be necessary for the
                    Arbitrator to reconsider the issue and hold that ENJV had waived its claims
                    against STEC for the 84 days’ delay since ENJV’s counterclaim has to
                    be dismissed in any case. However, in view of the lengthy submissions made by
                    both sides, I will consider the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     STEC’s submissions are based on the
                    principles enunciated in the cases of <em>Yamashita</em>
                    and <em>Gay Choon Ing</em> which it argued should have been
                    applied by the Arbitrator in determining the effect and intent of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA. <em>Yamashita</em>
                    was a case concerning the construction of a deed of settlement entered into
                    between the respondent and one of its major shareholders and creditors, SHS
                    Holding (Pte) Ltd (“SHSH”). The appellant was the assignee of
                    certain rights of SHSH under the deed. In a judgment for the majority of the
                    Court of Appeal, V K Rajah JA set out the following principles on the
                    interpretation of contracts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The court’s fundamental task
                        in interpreting a contract is to ascertain the objective intention of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The court should adopt a “contextual approach” to the
                        interpretation of contracts. Rajah JA adopted (at [63]) the following
                        passage from the Court of Appeal judgment of <em>Zurich
                            Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                            Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029
                            (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”), at
                        [122]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The courts are allowed to depart from the plain and ordinary meaning
                            of the contract to some extent. The very recognition that surrounding
                            circumstances may create ambiguity about the language used in a contract
                            involves acceptance that words do not have fixed and clearly delineated
                            meanings. Rather, words are sometimes penumbral; <em>the context of the
                            contract breaks down the rigidly-defined boundaries of meaning,
                            introduces hues and shades, and defines the contours and limits of the
                            penumbra.</em> Thus, even in its ostensibly conservative reasoning in
                            <em>Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd [v Wee Ah Kee</em> [1997]
                            2 SLR(R) 1], the Court of Appeal only required that the
                            meaning imputed by the court be one which 'the words are reasonably
                            adequate to convey' ... The question of whether this restriction has
                            been breached is one of degree. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The contextual approach involves, in appropriate cases, a
                        consideration of, <em>inter alia</em>, the commercial
                        purpose of the contract in question (at [64]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     Extrinsic evidence is admissible under proviso
                            (<em>f</em>) to s 94 of the Evidence Act
                        (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) to aid in the interpretation of written words.
                        Such extrinsic evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant, reasonably
                        available to all contracting parties and relates to a clear or obvious
                        context. However, the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual
                        intention(s) remains paramount. Thus, such admissible extrinsic evidence
                        must always go towards proof of what the parties, from an objective
                        viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon. Where extrinsic evidence in the form of
                        prior negotiations and subsequent conduct is concerned, there should be no
                        absolute or rigid prohibition against such evidence although in the normal
                        case such evidence is likely to be inadmissible for non-compliance with the
                        requirements of relevance, ready availability to parties, and clarity and
                        obviousness of the context of the contract (at [65]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     A court should always be careful to
                        ensure that extrinsic evidence is used to explain and illuminate the written
                        words, and not to contradict or vary them (at [65]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Gay Choon
                    Ing</em>, the Court of Appeal dealt with the question of whether there was
                    a valid compromise agreement between the parties by virtue of the
                    contemporaneous execution of points of agreement and a waiver letter by both
                    parties. In his judgment, Andrew Phang JA set out the principles on the law of
                    compromise as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     Compromise can be defined as the
                        settlement of dispute by mutual concession, its essential foundation being
                        the ordinary law of contract (at [41]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where parties have demonstrated that they intend
                        to dispose of their dispute by reaching an amicable resolution agreeable to
                        both parties, this compromise or settlement will be recognised and given
                        effect to by the courts (at [42]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     Before a compromise can be reached between two parties,
                        there must, of necessity, be an actual or potential dispute between parties
                        that can be disposed of (at [43]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     A compromise will not arise unless the following
                        requirements are fulfilled (at [46]):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">An identifiable agreement that is complete

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     STEC contended that applying the principles
                    governing the interpretation of contracts to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    SA, it can be seen that the commercial purpose of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA was to effect a compromise agreement
                    between STEC and ENJV such that both parties would release each other from their
                    liabilities to each other as at the date of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    SA in the spirit of reciprocity that necessarily accompanied compromise
                    agreements. STEC claimed that it had submitted a claim to ENJV for an extension
                    of time because ENJV had handed over the SB and NB launch shafts 95 days later
                    than planned whilst the Phase 3 tunnelling works had already been in delay by
                    117 days according to the target dates in the 22B3 Programme. Thus, according to
                    STEC, by the time the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was executed, there was
                    a difference between ENJV and STEC which both parties had agreed to resolve by
                    way of a compromise arrangement. ENJV denied that the commercial purpose of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA was to effect a compromise arrangement
                    between the two parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although STEC sought to rely on certain
                    “contemporaneous documents” to show that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA was intended to be a compromise agreement,
                    such extrinsic evidence can only be resorted to when words of the contract are
                    not clear and unambiguous or when the circumstances make ambiguous what would
                    otherwise be plain. I must therefore look first at the language of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Under the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA,

                    (“Advance Payment”). Clause 1.0 of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA provides for this obligation as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In consideration of the Advance Payment, STEC

                    date of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA) related to the Sub-Contract
                    works. It can be seen from the language of cl 4.0 (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) that there is absolutely no mention of
                    any waiver of claims on ENJV’s part. Only STEC had agreed to waive its
                    claims for, <em>inter alia</em>, extension of
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The next clause which is relevant to the
                    current inquiry is cl 7.0 (also at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above) which provides that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA should take
                    precedence in the event of any conflict between it and any other document
                    comprising the Sub-Contract. This means that the parties had agreed that to the
                    extent that other provisions of the Sub-Contract concluded prior to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA were contrary to the provisions of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA, they would be superseded by and subject
                    to the provisions of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Looking at the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    SA in its entirety, it seems reasonably clear that it was not intended as a
                    compromise agreement. First, one obvious indicator of lack of such intention to
                    compromise is the fact that <em>only</em> STEC was obliged
                    to waive its claims against ENJV in respect of extension of time. There is
                    nothing in the plain unambiguous wording of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    SA that provides for a similar waiver of claims against STEC by ENJV. This is
                    quite different from the facts of <em>Gay Choon
                    Ing</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In that case, the points of agreement provided

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Gay Choon Ing and Mr Terence Loh Sze Ti have agreed that

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Unlike the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA,
                    the words of the waiver letter in <em>Gay Choon Ing</em>
                    indicated clearly and unambiguously that each party to the compromise
                    arrangement had agreed that he had no claims against the other party to the
                    same. Certainly, the Court of Appeal in <em>Gay Choon
                        Ing</em> had thought it necessary to consider not just the words but
                    the context of the points of agreement and the waiver letter; this was clear
                    from Phang JA’s observations that (at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key inquiry, <b>having regard to the events that
                            transpired and led to the present proceedings</b> as mentioned
                        above, was whether or not the POA [<em>i.e</em>.,
                        points of agreement] and the Waiver Letter constituted a valid compromise
                        agreement between the parties. Running slightly ahead of the story, so to
                        speak, it was in fact clear to us, <b>from a close analysis
                            of these documents as well as the context furnished by the course of
                            correspondence between the parties from October 2004 to February
                            2005</b>, that both the plaintiff and the defendant, for all
                        intents and purposes, acted and proceeded on the basis that there was a
                        concluded compromise. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in
                        bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Secondly, it is expressly stated in the
                    preamble that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was entered into out of a
                    “desire to amend the Domestic Sub-contract”. The main amendment is
                    as to the provision of a performance bond by STEC to ENJV and the sequence of
                    progress payments by ENJV to STEC. Under cl 11.0 of the LA, STEC was
                    supposed to furnish ENJV with a performance bond equivalent to 5% of the
                    Sub-Contract sum within 4 weeks from the date of the LA. Under cl 7.0 of
                    the LA, ENJV was supposed to make an advance payment of 5% of the Sub-Contract
                    sum within 14 days of the presentation of the performance bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Thus, contractually, STEC was obliged to
                    furnish ENJV with a performance bond by 2 January 2003, being 4 weeks from the
                    date of the LA. This bond was not furnished by then and was still outstanding
                    when the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was concluded (26 July 2003).
                    Therefore, ENJV’s obligation to pay the 5% advance payment to STEC had not
                    arisen and no monies at all were due from it to STEC. These facts support
                    ENJV’s submission that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was intended
                    to vary the terms of the LA in order to provide financial assistance to STEC so
                    that it could fund procurement of labour and materials to commence the
                    Sub-Contract works. The fact that STEC had not managed to provide the
                    performance bond by the time of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA is a
                    further indication that it was facing some financial difficulty at that
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It was stated in the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA at cl 1.2(i) that part of the Advance
                    Payment was to pay for sums recently invoiced by STEC’s sub-contractors
                    for individual items of equipment procured from them. Under cl 1.2(iv) STEC
                    was also to assign its rights and benefits to ENJV for those equipment under the
                    STEC sub-contractors’ scope of works. In particular, the equipment
                    referred to specifically included (at cl 1.2(v)) locomotives, gantry
                    cranes, liquid grout, ventilation equipment and muck cars. These were items
                    which STEC was under the obligation to provide as part of the Sub-Contract works
                        (<em>per</em> cl 3.0 of the LA). That part of the
                    Advance Payment would go towards paying STEC’s sub-contractors for
                    individual items of equipment and that in consideration of such payment ENJV
                    would enjoy the rights and benefits for those equipment under the various
                    sub-contract scope of works indicate that STEC needed financial assistance in
                    order to procure the equipment necessary for its commencement of the
                    Sub-Contract works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     With regard to the effect of cl 7.1 of
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, STEC contended that since cl 4.0 of
                    the LA had not been amended by the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, it was
                    entitled to the benefit of the portion of cl 4.0 of the LA which states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In the event of a revision of the Main
                            Contractor’s Programme</em>, the original duration of the
                        programmed activity of the Domestic Subcontractor shall not be diminished.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, this does not aid STEC in forwarding its argument that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA was a contract effecting a compromise
                    arrangement. ENJV acknowledged that it had handed over the launch shaft areas
                    late. However, STEC had not shown that there was any corresponding <em>revision</em> to the Main Contractor’s Programme,
                        <em>ie</em>, the 22B3 Programme. Delay in the handing
                    over of the launch shaft site cannot by itself without other evidence imply that
                    there was a consequent revision of the 22B3 Programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Further, in my view, there was nothing in the
                    surrounding circumstances that rendered the otherwise plain language of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA ambiguous. Looking at the extrinsic
                    evidence, the contemporaneous documentary evidence referred to by both parties
                    supported ENJV’s position rather than STEC’s. In the first place,
                    while STEC contended that it had submitted a claim to ENJV for extension of time
                    and related costs arising from the late handover by ENJV of the launch shafts,
                    the documents that it referred to did not indicate so. In two letters dated 19
                    April 2003 and 2 May 2003 by STEC’s Liu Chun to ENJV’s Choo Ket
                    Weng, it is merely stated that STEC’s engineers had been to the proposed
                    new SB and NB shaft construction site and found that “excavation and
                    strutting work has not been started”, attaching photographs indicating
                    the work progress in the respective areas. The letters ended off with
                    STEC’s statement that “[w]e will keep you informed of the on-going
                    situation and submit the cost and time impact of this event on the project when
                    they are known to us”. These letters did not indicate that STEC was
                    making a claim against ENJV for extension of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In its appellant’s case, STEC also
                    referred to four other letters from ENJV which purportedly showed ENJV’s
                    consistent acknowledgment that STEC should keep to the Contract Duration
                    provided in the 22B3 Programme. The first, ENJV’s letter dated 4 April
                    2003, in essence showed that ENJV had reservations as to whether STEC would be
                    able to complete the Sub-Contract works on time because of lack of experienced
                    workers and insufficient detail in the schedule that it had provided. The next
                    letter, dated 16 June 2003, asked STEC to explain why its programme was longer
                    than the contract duration; for example, STEC’s programme showed that 41
                    days were required to assemble the tunnel boring machine whilst the contract
                    duration for this task was 35 days. The letter also showed ENJV’s
                    continuing dissatisfaction with STEC’s proposed schedule for the
                    tunnelling works. In its letter of 17 June 2003, ENJV indicated that it was not
                    willing to accept any claims or extension of time due to the late handover of
                    the SB launch shaft. Finally, ENJV made the following complaints on 21 June
                    2003:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further to our fax … dated 16<sup>th</sup> June 03
                        regarding STEC’s programme for the initial drive for which we are
                        still waiting for a reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have requested an updated detailed programme from STEC many times
                        (latest request being our fax … dated 17<sup>th</sup>

                            18<sup>th</sup> June 03 in which you had clearly not
                        updated your original programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would like to point out that your original programme <b>does not</b> follow the tunneling sequence and method as

                        importance and therefore, we request your presence in a meeting before

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The overall impression given by these letters
                    was not that ENJV had consistently asserted that the Contract Duration should be
                    adhered to. Rather, they show that STEC had consistently been remiss in its
                    obligations to provide a proper method statement or detailed programme to
                    ENJV’s satisfaction that it <em>could</em> in fact
                    complete the Sub-Contract works according to the 22B3 Programme. ENJV also
                    pointed out in the respondent’s case that the first three letters that
                    STEC had cited only referred to the Drive B1 tunnels and not to the rest of the
                    Sub-Contract works. Therefore, these letters did not show ENJV’s
                    willingness to compromise on its claims against STEC for the delay in completion
                    of the Sub-Contract works. Instead, much of the correspondence exhibited in
                    support of ENJV’s witness statement of Choo Ket Weng served to justify
                    ENJV’s position that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was intended as
                    a record of the arrangements by which ENJV would provide financial assistance to
                    STEC for the procurement and continued maintenance of the equipment needed to
                    commence the Sub-contract works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It is not necessary to cite all the
                    correspondence. Only two further letters need to be referred to. First, in a
                    letter from STEC to ENJV dated 30 June 2003, STEC had submitted a payment
                    request for $864,806.77 in respect of tunnelling work including installation of
                    segment lining. ENJV was requested to “treat this request as part of the
                    staged payment in accordance with Clause 6.0 of the Letter of
                    Award”. STEC further stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We wish to inform you that we are in the process of procuring the
                        Performance Bond as required under the Sub-Contract. Thus, your early
                        approval of payment in relation to the request would certainly assist us in
                        our cash flow, site operations and smooth running of the Sub-Contract
                        works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, ENJV’s response of 9 July 2003 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We cannot agree to the reasons for your issue of such a letter and record
                        that the poor cash-flow you are presently encountering and causing the
                        distress of not being able to provide the payments for your own equipment,
                        is entirely due to your own default in failing to issue the Performance
                        Bond.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such issue of that Bond by your company would have released to you an
                        advance payment which would likely cover for [<em>sic</em>] the present cash flow shortfall you claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, we are presently reviewing this position presented to us by your
                        letter and will inform you of our decision in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was concluded 17 days
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The evidence thus supported ENJV’s
                    submission that the purpose of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was to give
                    financial assistance to STEC and was not to effect a compromise arrangement
                    between the parties. The commercial purpose of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA was not what STEC tried to make it out to
                    be. Therefore it would be wrong to interpret the agreement to mean that ENJV had
                    waived its claims against STEC for delay in completion of the Sub-Contract
                    works. There is no express provision in the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA to
                    that effect and it should not be implied into that agreement because the factual
                    matrix in which the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was concluded makes it
                    plain that the objective intention of the parties had nothing to do with
                    effecting a compromise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     If STEC’s interpretation of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA is correct, that ENJV had released STEC
                    from its liabilities under the Sub-Contract for delay in the completion of the
                    works under the Sub-Contract, then STEC’s waiver of claims for extension
                    of time under cl 4.1 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA would have no
                    real effect. In respect of any delay caused to the completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works, either STEC was responsible for the delay or it was not. If
                    it was not responsible for the delay, it would be entitled to an extension of
                    time for the duration of that delaying event. Since it had waived its claim for
                    extension of time under the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, no extension of
                    time was claimed and none was given so it should be held responsible for any
                    delay that may have arisen through events that occurred prior to and up to 26
                    July 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Arbitrator’s findings on this issue
                    cannot therefore be criticised. He held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     STEC had waived its claim for 84
                        days of delay under cl 4.1 of the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA (at
                        para 130 of the Partial Award);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     One consequence of such waiver was that STEC was not
                        entitled to any delay related expenses or additional compensation for the 84
                        days of delay (at para 131 of the Partial Award);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     STEC’s waiver of a claim for
                        extension of time must mean that STEC was conceding any argument that ENJV
                        (or its related parties such as agents, or sub-contractors) could have
                        caused the delay or that there were any neutral events for which it had not
                        assumed any risks of delay. In other words, STEC’s waiver resulted in
                        its assumption of any risks of delay (at para 462 of the Partial
                        Award);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        effect of a waiver of a claim for extension of time was the same as the
                        effect of a failure to obtain an extension of time (at para 463 of the
                        Partial Award); and therefore</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_e"></a>(e)     STEC was responsible for the 84 days of delay that were
                        waived by the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, subject to the adequate
                        establishment of ENJV’s loss or damages (at para 464 of the
                        Partial Award).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Arbitrator had, therefore, considered the
                    relevant legal factors in arriving at his decision. Even if he had applied
                        <em>Yamashita</em> and <em>Gay Choon
                        Ing</em>, he would have come to the conclusion that the objective
                    intention of the parties in executing the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA had
                    nothing to do with a compromise and that there was no compromise to which he
                    could give effect. It is also important, as ENJV submitted, that STEC’s
                    present argument that the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA was meant to be a
                    compromise was never put forward at the arbitration proceedings. In fact
                        <em>Yamashita</em> was decided on 30 December 2008
                    while <em>Gay Choon Ing</em> was decided on 8 January 2009,
                    so neither of these authorities could have been included in the parties’
                    closing submissions before the Arbitrator, the last of which was submitted in
                    October 2008. The argument on a compromise agreement was a belated one. In the
                    events that happened, STEC may have considered that it made a bad bargain by
                    entering into the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA but this was not its view
                    point at the time when it needed ENJV’s assistance. If the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> SA had the effect that STEC contended, it
                    would have made even less commercial sense for ENJV to enter into an agreement
                    which obliged it to make an advance to STEC to which STEC was not entitled and
                    in exchange absolve STEC from possibly being liable for damages for delay when
                    ENJV could be asked to pay LTA $49,000 a day for delays arising from
                    STEC’s default. In this context, the following observation of the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>MAE Engineering Ltd v. Fire-Stop Marketing Services
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 379 at [27], which was also
                    cited by the Arbitrator, is apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two points arise herefrom. First, the perceived
                        “commercial sense” of the court cannot be allowed to override
                        the words of a contract where they are clear and unambiguous. We had earlier
                        stated that on a plain and ordinary reading of the words and figures in the
                        sub-contract, payment should be based on the area of the uncladded duct.
                        Even if the court below was of the view that First-Stop had entered into an
                        improvident bargain, one cannot ignore the plain meaning of the words used
                        and hold in favour of what the judge perceived to be a more commercially
                        sensible arrangement. The court’s task is to ascertain what the
                        parties mean by the words they use in a contract and enforce it according to
                        its terms: it should not rewrite the contract. In <em>Charter
                            Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan</em> [1997] 3 AC 313, Lord Mustill
                        noted (at 388):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]o force upon the words a meaning which they cannot fairly bear is
                            to substitute for the bargain actually made one which the court believes
                            could better have been made. This is an illegitimate role for a court.
                            Particularly in the field of commerce, where the parties need to know
                            that they must do and what they can insist on not doing, it is essential
                            for them to be confident that they can rely on the court to enforce
                            their contract according to its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the event, I am satisfied that there is no
                    merit in the second question of law raised by STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As I have found in favour of STEC in relation
                    to the first question of law, the Partial Award and the Correction Award must be
                    remitted to the Arbitrator for his reconsideration on the issue of ENJV’s
                    counterclaim for damages for loss and damage incurred by reason of STEC’s
                    late completion of the Sub-Contract works. The appeal is therefore allowed and
                    there shall be an order to such effect. As for costs, since I have found in
                    favour of STEC on one issue and against it on the other, I will hear further
                    arguments on costs.</p>
