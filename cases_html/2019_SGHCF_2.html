The District Judge found that the 2008 Will was not valid, though the precise grounds for her finding are not entirely clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 First, the District Judge pointed out the imprecision of the 2008 Will and observed that there appeared to have been no real discussion between Ms Neo and [T] regarding the difficulties posed by [T]’s instructions and the lack of clarity of the drafted clauses (the GD at [21] and [24]). The lack of discussion put [T]’s understanding of the contents of the 2008 Will in doubt (the GD at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The District Judge accepted that [T] had testamentary capacity at the time of executing the 2008 Will. She also correctly recognised that this would ordinarily give rise to a rebuttable presumption that [T] knew and approved of the contents of the 2008 Will. However, that presumption did not arise when there were circumstances surrounding the execution which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will did not express the mind of the testatrix (the GD at [26]). It was the District Judge’s view that the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 2008 Will pointed to a situation where [T], “in her haste to recover monies which she believed the plaintiff owed her, entered into some form of understanding and one of the acts to further her haste to recover such monies, was to transfer the HDB flat to him” (the GD at [27]). In particular, there was initially an agreement between [T] and the appellant for the appellant to give [T] money in exchange for permission to stay with her (the GD at [27(i)]). However, it appeared that this understanding was not honoured, causing [T] to behave hostilely towards the appellant (the GD at [27(iv)]). The District Judge also observed that the circumstances regarding the preparation and execution of the 2008 Will stood in sharp contrast to those regarding the 2004 Will and were incongruous with the way in which [T] treated her descendants (the GD at [27(v)] and [27(vi)]). Finally, the District Judge thought that the terms of the 2008 Will were constrained by the appellant’s financial means and therefore had not been executed by [T] “with a free mind and spirit”. For a will to be a true reflection of the testator’s intentions, it had to be made “free from pressure”, which was not the case here (the GD at [27(viii)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Having articulated these considerations, the District Judge stated that “it [could not] safely be concluded [that the 2008 Will was] one which reflects the true will of the testatrix”. She therefore found that the 2008 Will was not valid and the 2004 Will had not been revoked (the GD at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is settled law that for a will to be found valid, three elements must be satisfied: the testator must (a) have the mental capacity to make a will; (b) have knowledge and approval of the contents of the will; and (c) be free from undue influence or the effects of fraud (<span class="font-italic">Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners)</span> [2010] 4 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span>”) at [37]). It is also well-established that a will must be revocable and take effect upon the testator’s death (<span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> (John G Ross Martyn <span class="font-italic">et al</span> eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span>”) at para 1-001).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The legal burden of propounding a will lies in every case upon the party propounding the will (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee </span>at [40], [46] and [52]; <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills </span>(15th Ed, 2001) at pp 35–38, cited in <span class="font-italic">R Mahendran and another v R Arumuganathan</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 166 (“<span class="font-italic">Mahendran</span>”) at [15]). In this case, the respondent argues that [T] lacked testamentary capacity; did not have knowledge of and did not approve the contents of the 2008 Will; and executed the 2008 Will under undue influence. He also argues that the 2008 Will was not revocable, and that it was invalid because it sought to cheat the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) of stamp duty and HDB of levies payable on transfer. I address these arguments in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Testamentary capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The propounder of a will bears the legal burden of proving testamentary capacity (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [40]). The essential requisites of testamentary capacity are that: (i) the testator understands the nature of the act and what its consequences are; (ii) he knows the extent of his property of which he is disposing; (iii) he knows who his beneficiaries are and can appreciate their claims to his property; and (iv) he is free from an abnormal state of mind (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [37], citing <span class="font-italic">Banks v Goodfellow</span> (1870) LR 5 QB 549 (“<span class="font-italic">Banks v Goodfellow</span>”) at 565). As regards the first requirement, the testator need not be able to “view his will with the eye of a lawyer” or “comprehend its provisions in their legal form”; it suffices if “he has such a mind and memory as will enable him to understand the elements of which it is composed, and the disposition of his property in its simple forms” (<span class="font-italic">Banks v Goodfellow</span> at 567). It should also be noted that the capacity to make a will may vary depending on the complexity of the testator’s affairs and family situation, and on whether the will is a simple or complicated one. This is stated in <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span>, a treatise cited by the appellant, at para 3-002, and is further supported by <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 15 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) at para 190.190. In determining testamentary capacity, the court must consider the totality of the evidence as a whole, including both the factual component (including evidence of friends and relatives who had the opportunity to observe the testator) and the medical component, and generally accord equal weight to both types of evidence so long as both the factual and medical witnesses had the opportunity to observe the testator at the material time (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Testamentary capacity will generally be presumed when the will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances where the testator was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. One indication of testamentary capacity is the rationality of the will, having regard to its terms and the identities of the beneficiaries (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [40], citing <span class="font-italic">George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 631 at [33]–[36] and [67]). <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> states at para 3-010 that if a duly executed will is rational on its face, the testator is presumed to have had testamentary capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having set out the applicable legal principles, I turn now to the evidence. In my view there is insufficient evidence that [T] lacked testamentary capacity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The family members’ evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 At the time the 2008 Will was executed, [T] was nearly 80 years old. The respondent and his witnesses testified that, at the time, [T] was illiterate, short-sighted, short of hearing, had a history of illness and “had very poor mental recognition”.

</div> Dr Koh explained at trial that the AMT was a questionnaire. The patient would be asked, for example, to give his or her home address, age and date of birth; who the current Prime Minister was; to count down from twenty to one; and to remember a specific phrase and then recount it a few questions later. If all the questions were answered correctly, the patient would score 10 out of 10. Dr Koh explained that if a patient scored 7 out of 10 or lower, he or she would be suspected of having cognitive impairment. However, this was only a screening questionnaire and not used to diagnose cognitive impairment or to assess the severity of cognitive impairment, so Dr Koh was unable to confirm whether [T] was cognitively impaired.

The test for approval and knowledge, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> at para 3-017 (citing the English Court of Appeal’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Gill v Woodall</span> [2011] Ch 380 (“<span class="font-italic">Gill v Woodall</span>”)) is whether the testator understood (a) what was in the will when he signed it; and (b) what its effect would be. This requirement is also sometimes described by saying that the will must reflect the true intentions of the testator (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [49], citing <span class="font-italic">Fuller v Strum</span> [2002] 1 WLR 1097 at [65]; <span class="font-italic">Gill v Woodall</span> at [14]). However, the testator need not comprehend the full effect of the words used in the will, and the will may be valid even if he was mistaken as to the legal effect of the provisions (<span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills </span>at para 3-018;<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 190.194). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Once testamentary capacity is established, a rebuttable presumption arises that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will and the evidential burden shifts to the opponent of the will to rebut this presumption. This presumption, however, will not operate where there were circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will did not express the mind of the testator (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [46]; <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng</span> [2016] 3 SLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span>”) at [65]). In that regard, the applicable principles are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Any circumstances which have nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the will are to be disregarded (<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span> at [58] and [59]). While conduct subsequent to the preparation and execution of the will may be taken into account, such conduct “must have a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will” (<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span> at [60] and [63]). I understand this to mean that subsequent conduct is only relevant in so far as it constitutes evidence of the contemporaneous circumstances relating to the preparation and execution of the will.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is no magic formula (comprising a certain fixed number of factors or criteria) to ascertain whether the circumstances surrounding a will are suspicious. The degree of suspicion will vary with the circumstances of the case (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An example of a suspicious circumstance is where a will was prepared by a person who takes a substantial benefit under it, or who procured its execution, such as by suggesting the terms to the testator or instructing a solicitor to draft the will which is then executed by the testator alone (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where suspicious circumstances exist, the propounder of the will must prove on a balance of probabilities that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will by adducing affirmative evidence of the testator’s knowledge and approval. The greater the degree of suspicion, the stronger the affirmative proof of the testator’s knowledge and approval must be to dispel the suspicion (<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span> at [70]; <span class="font-italic">Mahendran</span> at [15], cited in <span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee </span>at [46]; <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> at para 3-024). The court will typically look for evidence that the testamentary instrument was read over by, or to, the testator, or evidence that the testator gave instructions for the drafting of the will and that the will was drafted in accordance with those instructions (<span class="font-italic">Muriel Chee</span> at [48], citing <span class="font-italic">Barry v Butlin</span> (1838) 2 Moo PC 480 (“<span class="font-italic">Barry v Butlin</span>”) at 483–485). Under ordinary circumstances, the reading of a will to a testator not suffering from any mental infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the contents (<span class="font-italic">Muriel </span><span class="font-italic">Chee</span> at [56]). Proving that the terms of the will were read to or explained to the testator is “the best way to show that the testator understood the terms of the will (assuming he had testamentary capacity and his mind was not unduly influenced by some part or event)” (<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span> at [72]), though it is not the only way (<span class="font-italic">Barry v Butlin</span> at 485–486). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Given my finding that [T] had testamentary capacity at the time of making the 2008 Will, she is also presumed to have known and approved of its contents. The first question is then whether there are suspicious circumstances that would displace this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there were suspicious circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It appears that the District Judge found that the presumption that the   testator knew and approved of the contents of the 2008 Will did not arise due to suspicious circumstances (the GD at [26]–[27]). However, some of the points made at [27] of the GD – for example that the 2008 Will was kept in the appellant’s custody, and the lock-out incident in 2010 (see [51] below) – do not relate to the preparation and execution of the will, and therefore are not the type of suspicious circumstances that can prevent the presumption from arising (see [37(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my view, the only apparent suspicious circumstance which relates to the preparation and execution of the will is that the appellant, who is the sole beneficiary under the 2008 Will, was present at the signing of the 2008 Will. He stood to receive the greatest pecuniary gain under the 2008 Will, even if he were to comply with [T]’s “wish” by distributing $130,000 from his own funds to the persons listed in the will. However, the appellant’s mere presence at the time the 2008 Will was prepared and signed is not sufficient to constitute a suspicious circumstance; it must be shown that he somehow influenced the contents of the will, for example by suggesting terms to [T] or instructing Ms Neo (see [37(c)] above). But Ms Neo’s evidence is that she took instructions from [T] directly in Hokkien.

I consider that it has, for two main reasons. The first is that the provisions of the 2008 Will are on their face contradictory and the evidence does not satisfy me that they were explained to, understood by and approved by [T]. The second is that [T]’s conduct towards the appellant and her conversations with other family members suggest that she did not fully grasp the provisions of the 2008 Will, in particular that the appellant would inherit the Flat upon her death. I elaborate on these in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The contents of the 2008 Will</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The terms of the 2008 Will were drafted curiously. The legal difficulties are described in the GD at [18] and [24]. Chief among these is the fact that the Flat appears twice in the 2008 Will. First the Will states at cll 3–4 that [T] “wish[es]” to transfer ownership of the Flat to the appellant “in exchange for” him distributing $130,000 from his own funds to the listed persons. This makes it sound as though the Flat is a conditional gift, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a gift which fails if the specified condition fails to materialise (<span class="font-italic">Parry and Kerridge</span> at para 3-11; <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 190.228). However, the Flat is then included in the residuary clause, which means that the appellant would acquire the Flat <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the condition is not met. The 2008 Will therefore purports to dispose of the Flat in two inconsistent ways. If all the provisions of the 2008 Will are given effect, then the Flat would be included in the residuary estate addressed in cl 5. This means that the appellant would acquire the Flat even if he does not satisfy cl 4. This would be a perverse outcome, since it removes any incentive for the appellant to comply with [T]’s wishes. It is very doubtful that this is what [T] intended, and suggests that [T] did not know or approve of these terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Since [T] was illiterate and did not speak English, she would have depended entirely on Ms Neo to communicate the effect of the provisions of the 2008 Will to her in Hokkien. Ms Neo gave evidence that before affixing her signature as witness to the 2008 Will, she “explained the contents of the 2008 Will to [T] in the Hokkien dialect” and that [T] “appeared to understand the same, and confirmed that those were her testamentary wishes before signing”.

In that case, Ms Neo would not have discussed the same with [T], and [T] would not have known or approved of the contents of the 2008 Will. Indeed, the minutes which Ms Neo recorded from her meeting with [T] comprise only a perfunctory record of [T]’s instructions.

</div> Despite this, she does not appear to have discussed the effect of these clauses with [T] in any real depth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 My doubts regarding Ms Neo’s evidence that [T] understood the 2008 Will are further compounded by the fact that its terms do not seem to give effect to the instructions which Ms Neo recorded in her minutes of meeting. Besides the contradiction between cll 3–4 and 5, the minutes record that the sum of $130,000 was to be divided “equally” between the relevant persons. But the 2008 Will gave the respondent more than twice as large a portion from the $130,000 as each of the other persons named. This means that either Ms Neo’s record of [T]’s instructions was inaccurate, or she did not draft the 2008 Will in accordance with them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Besides Ms Neo’s minutes of meeting and her evidence regarding her usual practice when preparing a will for a client, Ms Neo could not recall any of the details of her meeting with [T]. She was unable to recall who (besides T) was present when the will was prepared, whether [T] had made a prior appointment, what time they met or how long it took her to draft the will. She said, “10 years ago I definitely cannot remember. I---I don’t even know who are they.”

</div> While Ms Neo cannot be faulted for being unable to recollect events which transpired more than a decade ago, this meant that the only evidence of what transpired during her meeting with [T] was the minutes she recorded, which were unsatisfactory for the reasons I have explained. The only other person at the meeting, Ms Neo’s secretary, was not called as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The minutes of meeting recorded by Ms Neo and her evidence at trial therefore suggested to me that the rather unusual contents of the 2008 Will had not been explained to [T] in sufficient detail or clarity as to enable her to understand and approve them. The Court of Appeal warned in <span class="font-italic">Low Ah Cheow and others v Ng Hock Guan</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at [38] that, where the construction of the terms of a will is contested, a failure on the drafting solicitor’s part to keep proper attendance notes and/or records may have adverse consequences, and might even persuade the court to doubt the veracity of the drafting solicitor’s testimony if a dispute arose as to the purport of the terms of the will. This, unfortunately, was the case here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) [T]’s conduct towards the appellant and her conversation with other family members</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Even leaving aside my doubts stemming from the terms of the 2008 Will and Ms Neo’s evidence, the evidence from the respondent and his witnesses suggested that [T] was not aware of the import of the 2008 Will, namely that the appellant would inherit the Flat on her death. [T] was hostile towards the appellant, appeared anxious to prevent him from acquiring the Flat, and made various attempts to ensure that he would not do so. Taken together, these factors suggest that <span class="font-italic">had</span><span class="font-italic"> [T] properly understood</span> the effect of the 2008 Will, she would have revoked or amended it. The most persuasive explanation for her failure to do so is that she did not fully understand the meaning of its provisions.

</div> The other witnesses unanimously testified that the respondent had contributed the most to caring for [T]. They too generally came across as honest and forthcoming, and were ready to admit they could not remember certain events. When they did speak to what they could recall, their evidence was largely consistent. Though the appellant claimed that his siblings looked down on him, he himself testified that he was on “not bad” terms with [L], and that he was able to communicate best with [J] and would call him and ask him out for coffee when there were important matters to discuss.

</div> but there was no suggestion that she was coached, and her oral evidence did not come across as rehearsed.) The only witness whose evidence was not entirely satisfactory was [J], because the striking similarities between the 2008 Will and the 2011 Document strongly suggest that [J] borrowed from the language of the 2008 Will in drafting the contents of the 2011 Document (see [14]–[15] above), contrary to his claim that he adapted the language from the results of an Internet search. Against that, however, it should be noted that [J] had the best relationship with the appellant of all the siblings

</div> and took the most conciliatory approach towards him before [T]’s death (see the GD at [27(iii)]). Yet, even [J] testified that there was hostility between [T] and the appellant. Moreover, even if [J] <span class="font-italic">had</span> seen the 2008 Will, that has no direct bearing on whether [T] understood and approved of its contents when she signed it. Ultimately, the appellate court should be very hesitant to disagree with the trial judge’s findings on the credibility of the witnesses, given the obvious advantage the trial judge enjoys in witnessing their evidence first-hand. I see no reason to disagree with the District Judge’s assessment in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accepting the evidence of these witnesses, then, it is obvious that [T] harboured profound resentment and animosity towards the appellant. She favoured the other children much more in comparison, and shared a special bond with the respondent, who took the most care of her. It therefore seems objectively unlikely that [T] intended the appellant to inherit the Flat – her most valuable possession – upon her death. That would result in the appellant receiving a much larger benefit than the respondent. This seems incongruent with [T]’s reputation as a very fair person.

This interpretation is further supported by an incident that occurred after the 2008 Will was executed. [T] asked [K] to drive her to HDB Hub as she needed advice from HDB regarding the Flat. [T] mentioned that she had signed a document provided by the appellant but did not understand its contents. After falling out with the appellant, [T] reportedly felt uneasy, did not trust the appellant and wanted to make sure that she had not transferred the Flat to him. [K] duly brought [T] to meet an HDB officer, who assured [T] that the Flat was still under her name and that it could not be sold or transferred without HDB’s consent.

If this occurred in 2009, as [K] testified at trial, then it would seem that [T]’s remarks about having signed a document she did not understand referred to the 2008 Will. But if [T] visited HDB in 2011, then [T] may have thinking about the 2011 Document instead. In either case, however, this visit to HDB shows two things. First, [T] was worried that somehow the Flat had already been transferred to the appellant. She therefore went to HDB to assuage her concerns, and was relieved when she was told that the Flat was still in her name. Secondly, [T] did not want the appellant to acquire the Flat. This is consistent with her repeated pleas to the respondent, [K] and [J] to help her “recover” the Flat and her expressed intention not to let the appellant acquire the Flat after she died (see [57(b)]–[57(d)] above). I accept that, if [T] had understood that the appellant would inherit the Flat under the terms of the 2008 Will, she would have revoked or amended that will. This view was shared by the respondent and [C].

</div> On this view, the fact that [T] was lucid until at least 2014 or 2015 supports the respondent’s case. For a good seven or eight years, [T] would have been in possession of her faculties and common sense, and would have revoked the 2008 Will if she had understood its import. The fact that she did not strongly suggests that she did not know and approve of its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thirdly, [T]’s conduct after executing the 2008 Will suggests that she did not know that she had bequeathed the Flat on the appellant. For one, [T] never once told [C] about the terms of the 2008 Will in the next eight years of her life. This is strange because they were very close and [T] appeared to confide in [C] about every important decision. From 2004 to 2010, while [C] was overseas, she would call [T] every Sunday afternoon without fail and chat with her in Hokkien for at least an hour. They would speak about their weeks and family updates. When [T] invited the respondent, [K] and the appellant to move into the Flat with her, she updated [C] about this.

[T] even went to the trouble of showing [C] the 2004 Will when [C] visited Singapore. But the terms of the 2008 Will altered the division of [T]’s estate dramatically. Whereas the 2004 Will divided [T]’s estate between all her children and [C] with the respondent receiving a larger share than the rest, the 2008 Will made the appellant the sole beneficiary and deprived [T]’s other children and [C] of any benefit save insofar as the appellant decided to comply with cl 4. This change would have been very surprising and even distressing to [C], as well as [T]’s other children. The fact that [T] never mentioned the terms of the 2008 Will to [C] led [K], the respondent and [C] herself to the view that [T] herself was not fully aware of its import.

This broadly aligns with the arrangement provided for in cll 3 and 4 of the 2008 Will, pursuant to which the appellant would inherit the Flat if he distributed $130,000 from his own funds to the persons listed therein. The appellant’s position was that by giving [T] $150,000 in 2011, he had complied with the condition in cl 4 of the 2008 Will.

</div> [T] could well have thought that she was receiving $150,000 for the appellant’s occupation (rather than acquisition or inheritance) of the Flat, in line with their original agreement (see [6] above). [J]’s own interpretation of the 2011 Document was that it merely recorded the fact that [T] had received money from the appellant, and was not meant to express [T]’s intention to transfer the Flat to him (see [13]–[15] above). Moreover, what [T] told the other family members, particularly the respondent and [C], to whom she was close and on whom she doted, suggests that [T] was not at all willing for the appellant to acquire the Flat, even after she had received the $150,000 in 2011. It is highly unlikely that [T] would have lied to [C] and the respondent about whether the appellant would inherit the Flat, given how close she was to them. In the light of [T]’s vehement animosity towards the appellant, her pleas for others to “recover” the Flat for her, and her confiding in her loved ones that the appellant would not get the Flat after she died, I can only conclude that [T] probably did not know she had bequeathed the Flat to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For these reasons, I find that the presumption of knowledge and approval has been rebutted, and dismiss the appeal on that basis.

</div> in which the High Court held at [163]–[164] that undue influence could be presumed where the plaintiff showed (a) the existence of a particular relationship which enabled one party to it to influence the decisions of the other (presumably the testator); and (b) the resulting transaction was clearly disadvantageous to the person subject to the influence. However, the authority which was cited for the presumption of undue influence, <span class="font-italic">Pelican Engineering Pte Ltd v Lim Wee Chuan </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 1145, concerned a contract rather than a will. Significantly, the academic authorities suggest that undue influence cannot be presumed in the probate context:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> states that the test for undue influence in the probate context “is a different test to that applied to examples of undue influence in respect of lifetime transactions” and that in respect of wills, “[p]ersuasion or advice is legitimate but coercion is not” (para 3-032 and n 135). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Parry and Kerridge</span> explains at para 5-54 that applying the presumption of undue influence in the probate context is inappropriate for two reasons. First, undue influence in probate consists of pressure exerted on the testator, whereas the undue influence in equity stems essentially from affection, not pressure. Secondly, applying the test for presumed undue influence in the probate context would invalidate wills made in favour of those whom testators hold in regard or affection, which is precisely the point of a will in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The same view is reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>, which states at para 190.199 that there is generally no presumption of undue influence despite the existence of a relationship between the testator and the beneficiary, and that strong evidence of undue influence is required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These points do not appear to have been raised to the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span>. Nor has <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span> been cited in any later decisions to support a presumption of undue influence in respect of a will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 By contrast, the contrary position has been taken in two more recent High Court decisions, which the parties did not refer me to. In <span class="font-italic">Rajaratnam</span>, it was held at [65] that undue influence cannot be presumed where a will is concerned and must be proved by the person alleging it. In <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng and </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2015] SGHC 205, the High Court held at [45] that “[i]n the case of a will where an allegation of undue influence on the testator is made, undue influence cannot be presumed and actual undue influence must be proved”, and adopted the test for undue influence set out in <span class="font-italic">Rajaratnam</span>. There was no appeal against the High Court’s finding on undue influence in that case, though the Court of Appeal noted (without disapproving) the High Court’s holding that “[w]here undue influence is alleged, it cannot be presumed and must be proved” (see <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span>, which was cited to me by the respondent,<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I note, moreover, that in <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span> it was alleged that undue influence infected not only a will executed by the testatrix but also various transactions entered into by her during her lifetime. This may perhaps explain the invocation of the presumption of undue influence, which <span class="font-italic">would</span> apply to such transactions. However, that does not necessarily mean that it ought to apply equally to a will. Indeed, the High Court also cited at [165] a treatise on wills which states that “[t]he essential element of undue influence is, in this context, coercion” and that “[p]ersuasion or influence or importunity is not sufficient”. It therefore recognised that the test for undue influence in the testamentary context is that of coercion alone.

All she said was that the will was not “one which [T] came to free from pressure” (the GD at [27(viii)]). However, the test for undue influence is a high one and requires coercion <span class="font-italic">overpowering </span>the testator’s volition. I do not think there is any evidence to show that [T] was unduly influenced in this sense. There is no clear evidence, for example, that the appellant pressurised or forced [T] to make the 2008 Will. [N] testified that [T] was a woman of tough character, “stronger” and “[n]ot easily influenced by other people”.

</div> The respondent says this for two reasons. First, the 2008 Will was “binding upon [T] as and when she put her thumb print to it” and [T] was “contractually ‘forced’ or bound” to confer the Flat on the appellant once the $130,000 was paid. The will was therefore “irrevocable”. Secondly, the appellant allegedly considered the 2008 Will “fixed or closed when he made the payment of $130,000.00 required of him on 23 July 2011”, which is contrary to the rule that a will operates on the death of the testator.

The respondent did not cite any authority to the effect that a condition such as that stated in cl 4 of the 2008 Will would render a will irrevocable or non-ambulatory. On the contrary, conditions are generally upheld unless they are void for illegality or contrariness to public policy; uncertainty; impossibility; repugnance to the estate; or conditions imposed <span class="font-italic">in terrorem</span> of the legatee (<span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> at paras 27-007 to 27-025). It was not contended that cl 4 was void for any such reason. I was also not referred to any authority for the proposition that a will becomes irrevocable once a condition stated therein has been performed during the testator’s lifetime. On the contrary, as the appellant points out, <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills </span>recognises at para 27-067 that “sometimes a condition may be performed in the lifetime of the testator”.

</div> Even assuming that the appellant performed the condition in cl 4 by giving [T] $150,000 in 2011, that would not have prevented [T] from revoking the 2008 Will thereafter.

The parties all agreed that the document was not validly executed and was not a will (at [38]). However, the plaintiff, who was stated as the beneficiary under that document, tried to argue that the document created or evidenced a trust over the deceased’s estate. Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) rejected this argument. He cited various <span class="font-italic">dicta</span>, including the portion from <span class="font-italic">Towers v Hogan</span> (1889) 23 LR Ir 53 cited at p 32 of the Respondent’s Case, in support of his conclusion that “[d]ocuments meant to be testamentary in character (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> having no effect during the life of the maker) which do not comply with the Wills Act cannot … become virtual wills by being regarded as declarations of trust” (at [42]). Since the document was not valid as a will, it was void, and should not be given effect by the backdoor through the device of an implied declaration of trust. Tay J’s decision had nothing to do with voiding an otherwise valid will because of illegality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the reasons I have stated in this judgment, I dismiss the appeal on the basis that [T] did not know and approve of the contents of the 2008 Will.
