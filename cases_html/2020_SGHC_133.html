The arbitrator noted in the award that it is “common ground that the central issue in the arbitration is whether [the first defendant] validly terminated the contract when it issued its Notice of Termination on 24 October 2014.  [The plaintiff] alleges that [the first defendant] had wrongfully terminated the Contract as it had no valid grounds to do so, while [the first defendant] contends that it was entitled and had validly done so”.

</div>  The tribunal issued Partial Award 3 on 9 April 2019.  Corrections to Partial Award 3 followed on 26 April 2019 and 15 May 2019.  In Partial Award 3, the tribunal found that the plaintiff was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, liable to the first defendant for liquidated damages for delay, and for damages arising from the first defendant’s valid termination of the Contract, comprising mainly the increased costs for the completion of the Project because of the replacement contract the first defendant entered into with the sixth defendant, and various other back-charges the first defendant was entitled to impose.   However, in view of the amount already received by the first defendant pursuant to its call on the performance bond, the tribunal found that there was a net balance owing from the first defendant to the plaintiff in the amount of S$6,405,536.34 (the “Award Sum”).  This net balance reflected the fact that the first defendant had been “over-paid” pursuant to the call on the performance bond, and the over-payment therefore had to be repaid to the plaintiff.

</div>  The seventh and ninth defendants, as professional quantity surveyors, had been instructed by the first defendant to conduct and supervise the replacement tender exercise, to evaluate the tender returns (the bids) submitted by the tenderers, and to recommend which tender return to accept for award of the replacement contract.  The eighth defendant had been instructed by the first defendant to assess the tender returns in the replacement tender in respect of the tenderers’ resources and scheduling proposals.  The crux of the allegations against the seventh to ninth defendants in this Suit are that they carried out their work in a negligent manner.

Issue estoppel applies, per <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>at [53], even where the causes of action in question are not the same in the new proceedings as they were in the previous proceedings.  In <span class="font-italic">BNX v BOE</span>, the judge struck out the plaintiff’s claims for fraudulent misrepresentation on the basis of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, issue estoppel, because the issue as to whether certain representations had been made had already been raised and decided at an earlier arbitration.

The extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> has its origins in the seminal decision of Sir James Wigram VC in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> [1843] 3 Hare 999 at 114, and has been developed incrementally in both England and Singapore.  In <span class="font-italic">Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 760, the Court of Appeal made the following observations at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 The prominence of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> was recently re-affirmed in the United Kingdom Supreme Court case of <span class="font-italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Zodiac Seats UK Limited (formerly known as Contour Aerospace Limited)</span> [2013] UKSC 46. Lord Sumption observed (at [25]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Res judicata and abuse of process are juridically very different. <span class="font-italic">Res judicata is a rule of substantive law, while abuse of process is a </span><span class="font-italic">concept which informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers.

This promotes the public interest of efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, and also prevents litigants from being oppressed and unfairly harassed by legal proceedings.  At [77] of <span class="font-italic">Antariksa</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics</span>, Wei J outlined the test for the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.  Specifically, the focus is on whether, “in all the circumstances, a party is abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it an issue <span class="font-italic">which could have been raised before</span>” (emphasis added).  The Court may also consider other factors, including whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not raised, and whether, holistically speaking, the later proceedings are in substance nothing more than a collateral attack on the previous decision.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 What is evident from my summary of the applicable legal principles is that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, unlike cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, is based on a more pragmatic rationale of not allowing parties to repeatedly come to court for matters which should have been dealt with in earlier proceedings.  The extended doctrine is more concerned with the proper administration of justice than the fact that parties’ rights have been extinguished by reason of an estoppel.  Cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel are unified on the basis that they address considerations which had in fact been raised in earlier proceedings, but the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> goes beyond that to consider points which <span class="font-italic">should have</span> been raised, but were not in fact raised. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The key issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The main issue for my determination is whether, on a holistic assessment, there is a proper basis to strike out the plaintiff’s three heads of claim, notwithstanding the high threshold that must be crossed in order to warrant doing so.  In deciding this point, I will consider each of the plaintiff’s heads of claims in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In relation to the plaintiff’s claims for lawful and unlawful means conspiracy against the first to ninth defendants, my analysis centres on whether these claims are barred by the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in all its three iterations as outlined at [40] above, and thus whether they should be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the plaintiff’s claim against the first and second defendants in the tort of intimidation, I will consider the plaintiff’s revised position on that claim (see [122] below), as well as the first defendant’s arguments to have the revised claim struck out on all four limbs of O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s claims for the torts of lawful and unlawful means conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff’s claims for lawful and unlawful means conspiracy have consistently centred on two factual situations, as illustrated by its initial Statement of Claim (filed on 30 December 2015):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17. However:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) From early 2014, [the second defendant] used the Project to make unlawful demands for monetary gratification from [the plaintiff], and improperly interfered with and/or influenced [the third, fourth, and/or fifth defendants’] administration of the Contract in order to exert improper pressure on [the plaintiff] and/or to manufacture a case for a premature termination of the Contract; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) After the Contract was wrongfully terminated by [the first defendant], [the first defendant] conspired and/or combined with [the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and/or ninth defendants] to make inflated, improper and/or unjustifiable claims for monies from [the plaintiff] purportedly pursuant to the termination of the Contract, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to trigger a call on the Performance Bond and put [the plaintiff] in financial peril. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiff’s present claims in conspiracy are grounded on the same two factual matrices, as outlined in its Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) dated 9 September 2019 (“ASOC”), save that the claims have been amended to reflect the arbitrator’s finding that the Contract had been validly terminated.  Before me, counsel for the plaintiff described these two factual matrices as two “sub-plots” to the conspiracy it was alleging, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first “sub-plot” pertains to the plaintiff’s allegations of a conspiracy between, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the first to fifth defendants to procure the issuance of ADs and Notices<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>which eventually gave rise to the first defendant’s termination of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second “sub-plot” concerns the plaintiff’s allegations of a conspiracy between, in particular, the first, second, sixth, seventh, eighth and/or ninth defendants to structure the replacement tender in such a manner as to ensure the appointment of the sixth defendant as the replacement contractor, and, more significantly, to maximise costs and thereby inflate the amount claimable from the plaintiff following the first defendant’s termination of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It bears note that the first “sub-plot” goes towards the allegedly wrongful issuance of ADs and Notices giving rise to termination of the Contract.  The second “sub-plot”, by contrast, goes towards the manner in which the replacement contract was procured and priced.  The latter, unlike the first “sub-plot”, deals with events <span class="font-italic">after</span> the termination of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It would be clear from my description of the two “sub-plots” above that each “sub-plot” is actually a separate cause of action for conspiracy.  Specifically, each “sub-plot” describes a standalone conspiracy, and each of the two “sub-plots” therefore provides a factual basis for claims in lawful and unlawful means conspiracy.  Viewed in totality, it would be more accurate, technically, to identify <span class="font-italic">four</span> claims in conspiracy by the plaintiff.  These are claims in lawful and unlawful means conspiracy arising from the first “sub-plot”, and further claims in lawful and unlawful means conspiracy arising from the second “sub-plot”. The specific unlawful means being alleged in the first “sub-plot” refer to the issuance of wrongful and unwarranted ADs, Notices and Termination Certificates, while the unlawful means asserted in relation to the second “sub-plot” appear to include acts targeted at having the sixth defendant appointed as the replacement contractor for the Project, as well as the inflation of the increased costs of completing the Project payable by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In this application, I am not being asked to assess the merits of the distinction between the pleaded cases of lawful and unlawful means conspiracy.  In any event, in my view, it is not necessary to distinguish between lawful and unlawful means conspiracy for the purposes of my analysis of the striking out application, whether for the first or second “sub-plot” of conspiracy.  This is because, as I will go on to explain, the main thrust of the striking out application is that the issues of (a) whether there is <span class="font-italic">agreement</span> between the various alleged conspirators, and (b) whether the plaintiff has suffered any <span class="font-italic">recoverable </span><span class="font-italic">loss</span> from those conspiracies, have both already been decided in the Arbitration.  Hence, the first defendant argues, the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> bars the bringing of <span class="font-italic">all</span> these conspiracy claims in these proceedings.  As these issues of agreement and loss are critical elements of <span class="font-italic">both</span> lawful and unlawful means conspiracy, my conclusions on <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> will determine whether the claims on these sub-plots should be permitted to go to trial, regardless of the type of conspiracy they relate to.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In seeking to strike out the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy, the first defendant relies on all three subspecies of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> outlined in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> ([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).

</div>  Given the commonality between cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel outlined at [48] above, I will consider those two subspecies of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>first, before moving on to consider, if necessary, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As a subsidiary argument, the first defendant also argues that the plaintiff’s claims for conspiracy ought to be struck out on the basis that the plaintiff’s pleadings do not disclose any particulars about the alleged agreement entered into between the conspirators, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the pleadings fail to particularise the essential elements making up the conspiracy, whether lawful or unlawful.

</div>  However, this subsidiary argument was not the focus of the oral submissions in the hearing before me.  This is quite understandable, given that a striking out application based on insufficiency of pleadings can, in most cases, be answered by the Court granting leave for the respondent to amend its pleadings, with a sanction of costs.  There is often little profit to be gained in such applications, save to improve the state of the pleadings.  I will deal with this subsidiary argument if it becomes necessary for me to do so, that is, if I find that the arguments on striking out on the basis of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I note for completeness, and as already mentioned, that the plaintiff has discontinued the action against the second to fifth defendants.  My analysis on the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy focuses, in any event, only on the first defendant’s application for striking out the claims that have been brought against it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first “sub-plot”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The first defendant argues that the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy arising from the first “sub-plot” should be struck out on the basis of cause of action estoppel, as well as issue estoppel.

</div>  The four requirements for cause of action estoppel, as outlined by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi</span>, have been set out above (see [42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The first requirement is satisfied as Partial Award 1 is a final and conclusive determination of the parties’ disputes on their merits.  The parties commenced the Arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause they had agreed to at cl 37 of the SIA Conditions, and the resolution of the disputes is described in the clause as being subject to the “final” decision of the arbitrator.  For completeness, I set out the relevant portion of the arbitration clause below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any dispute between the [first defendant] and the [plaintiff] as to any matter arising under or out of or in connection with this Contract or under or out of or in connection with the carrying out of the Works and whether in contract or tort, or as to any direction or instruction or certificate of the Architect or as to the contents of or granting or refusal of or reasons for any such direction, instruction or certificate shall be referred to the arbitration and final decision of a person to be agreed by the parties …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Arbitration dealt extensively with the parties’ contentions on the various claims that were put forward by the plaintiff.  In the process, voluminous factual and expert evidence on the contested issues was heard by the tribunal.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 My view that the Arbitration is a final and conclusive determination on the merits is buttressed by the fact that, as outlined at [24] above, all of the applications for leave to appeal questions of law arising from the Arbitration have been rejected or withdrawn.  As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals</span> [2016] 1 SLR 966 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) at [57], “[j]ust as finality is of significance to the courts, so too is it of importance to arbitration.  Thus, the courts will typically not rehear matters that have already been determined in arbitration …”.  The Court of Appeal thus accepted in principle that arbitration awards can be final and conclusive determinations for the purposes of invoking <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.  In any event, I note that the plaintiff does not appear to contest the finality and conclusiveness of the awards issued in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Turning to the second requirement, I accept that the tribunal was a competent tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties.  This flows from the fact that there was a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement between the parties, and a tribunal was constituted in accordance with the parties’ arbitration agreement. The plaintiff does not appear to challenge this point, and any challenge by the plaintiff would in any event be inconsistent with its own acts recognising the validity and competence of the tribunal.  These acts include acting in accordance with awards made by the tribunal.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The third requirement is that there must be identity of parties.  As Steven Chong J (as he then was) pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Cost Engineers (SEA) Pte Ltd and another v Chan Siew </span><span class="font-italic">Lun</span> [2016] 1 SLR 137 at [58], albeit in the context of issue estoppel:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I note that in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Lay Lian Cherlyn</span>, the court doubted the decision in <span class="font-italic">Jaidin</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Jaiman</span> not only on the ground that there was no final and conclusive judgment on the merits but also on the basis that the requirement of an identity of parties had not been satisfied because the first action, unlike the second, did not involve the pillion rider.  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">With respect, I think this objection takes too technical an approach to the requirement of an identity of parties.  As was succinctly explained in Goh Nellie at [33], the focus of the inquiry into </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the identity of the parties is whether ‘the principal players in both actions … are effectively identical’. </span> In <span class="font-italic">Jaidin</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Jaiman</span>, the principal players – as far as the question of <span class="font-italic">liability</span> for the accident was concerned – were always the driver of the car and the motorcyclist.  The pillion rider was both literally and figuratively a mere ‘passenger’ who did not contribute to the accident at all.  Thus, in so far as the key question of the apportionment of liability between the two parties who caused the accident, the requirement of identity of parties in both actions had been met … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in italics original, emphasis in bold italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I see no reason, in principle, why the above approach should not equally apply in the case of cause of action estoppel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The view that “[i]dentity of parties is not viewed narrowly” is also echoed at [40] of <span class="font-italic">Tan Bee Hoon (</span><span class="font-italic">executrix for the estate of Quek Cher Choi, deceased) and another v Quek Hung Heong and others </span>[2015] SGHC 229.  In a similar vein, this Court also concluded in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span> at [33] that, notwithstanding the fact that the parties to both actions were not exactly identical, identity of parties existed because “the principal players in both actions … are <span class="font-italic">effectively</span> identical” (emphasis added).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In this context, I am of the view that it would be simplistic to take the position that there is no identity of parties <span class="font-italic">purely because </span>the Arbitration only involved the plaintiff and first defendant, while Suit 1274 includes other defendants.  This formalistic approach should be eschewed in favour of recognising that the allegations in relation to the first “sub-plot” mainly concern the plaintiff on one side, and the first defendant on the other.  The second to fifth defendants are said to have conspired with the first defendant against the plaintiff for this first “sub-plot”.  It is the first defendant which is at the centre of the conspiracy because, according to the plaintiff, it is the party that wanted to get rid of the plaintiff as the main contractor, and which had enlisted the help of the architects to achieve this end by the issuing of the relevant Notices and Termination Certificates.  Further, it is the first defendant that stands to gain the most financially from this first “sub-plot”.  In my judgment, the principal players in both actions are effectively identical, and the requirement of identity of parties is met on the instant facts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Turning to the final requirement, that there is identity of causes of action, it was observed at [44] of <span class="font-italic">Zhang Run </span><span class="font-italic">Zi </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In coming to this view, I noted the emphasis that previous authorities on cause of action estoppel have placed on the substance of the subject matter of the cause of action, rather than mere differences or similarities in the form of the action.

In my view, this means that the task of the Court is to examine the matrix of factual allegations that the plaintiff is relying on to support its claim to relief, and to determine whether the same set of factual allegations was raised and adjudicated upon in the previous proceedings.  The Court does not simply accept the labels applied by the parties to the claims in the later legal proceedings.  In other words, the fact that the claim in the Arbitration is a claim for breach of contract, while the plaintiff raises claims for conspiracy in the present proceedings, is not determinative of whether cause of action estoppel can apply.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the first “sub-plot”, there are two central bases upon which the first defendant asserts that identity of causes of action is present.  First, the plaintiff is relying on materially the same facts to establish the first “sub-plot” in Suit 1274 as it sought to rely on to establish a wrongful and unjustifiable termination of the Contract in the Arbitration.  Second, the plaintiff is, in effect, seeking the same remedies as it was seeking in the Arbitration.

In order for the plaintiff to have succeeded in its claim for breach of contract in the Arbitration, it was necessary for the arbitrator to have found that several ADs had been improperly issued because of illegitimate pressure exerted by the first and/or second defendant.  The plaintiff’s case in relation to the first “sub-plot” in this Suit 1274 is fundamentally similar – that the ADs were improperly issued pursuant to a conspiracy between, amongst others, the first to fifth defendants.  The impropriety of the ADs is central to both causes of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the notion that the third defendant was not independent is another essential similarity in both causes of action.

</div>  This latter point, in particular, is one which troubles me and for which the plaintiff’s counsel was not able to satisfactorily address in his submissions before me.  Put simply, since the arbitrator had found in his Partial Award 1 that the architects had acted independently and properly in the issuance of the ADs, how then is it possible for the plaintiff to argue that the first defendant had conspired with the architects to procure the wrongful issuance of the ADs without <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> running into the estoppel that operates by reason of the arbitrator’s decision on this point?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Third, the second defendant’s acts in demanding monetary gratification were raised in the Arbitration, and now again in these proceedings.  In the action for breach of contract in the Arbitration, the plaintiff claimed that the second defendant’s acts, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, improperly pressured or influenced the third defendant to issue the ADs, interfered with the plaintiff’s progress on the Project, and/or constituted improper acts by the first defendant, which precluded the first defendant from relying on those acts to terminate the Contract.

</div>  In the alleged first “sub-plot” in Suit 1274, the second defendant’s acts and the responses from the plaintiff are framed as having been a reason the second defendant sought to conspire with the other defendants to issue improper ADs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 All three of these aspects of the plaintiff’s complaints were adjudicated upon in the Arbitration.  While the tribunal recognised that some of the ADs were in fact invalid because they were, for example, not matters that should be properly covered by an AD or that the third defendant had been mistaken as to the facts when it issued the AD, he found that there was no basis to assert that <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the ADs that were issued were the result of illegitimate pressure or interference on the part of the first defendant or its agents.  The arbitrator found that, at all times, the architects acted independently and were not influenced in their decisions concerning the ADs.  Significantly, the arbitrator found that there were a number of ADs which were valid and which had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been complied with by the first defendant.  These ADs provided sufficient basis for the issuance of Termination Certificates 260 and 262, which in turn permitted the first defendant to lawfully terminate the Contract with the plaintiff.

This is unsurprising given that the plaintiff, by seeking the legal costs of the entire Arbitration, is in effect attempting to subsume and reverse the awards and costs ordered in the Arbitration through this claim.  I do not accept that this claim is legitimate because it is little more than a collateral attack the arbitrator’s findings in the Arbitration.  If one refers to the fact that the plaintiff is seeking the <span class="font-italic">full</span> cost of the Arbitration and the legal proceedings because of the alleged conspiracy (which is claimed to have given rise to the termination of the Contract), it becomes immediately apparent that the plaintiff is, in effect, seeking to “un-do” the effect of the awards issued in the Arbitration.

</div>  I am not satisfied that there is a viable basis for the plaintiff’s claim for its costs and expenses arising out of or in relation to the termination of the Contract, the call on the performance bond, and the disputes arising from those developments, and accordingly discount it from my consideration of the applicable reliefs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 What the above analysis on the reliefs being pursued in Suit 1274 underscores is the identity of causes of action on the instant facts.  Not only does the cause of action in relation to the first “sub-plot” rely on the same material facts as the plaintiff had relied on in the Arbitration, the plaintiff seeks remedies for the first “sub-plot” which it had already sought in the Arbitration.  In short, the same factual matrix is relied upon by the plaintiff to give rise to its claim to be entitled to substantially the same kind of reliefs in these legal proceedings.  In my judgment, this illustrates that there is identity of causes of action, and given that all the four requirements for cause of action estoppel are met, cause of action estoppel applies in the present suit as a basis for striking out the plaintiff’s claims for lawful and unlawful means conspiracy in relation to the first “sub-plot”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 My findings in relation to cause of action estoppel above would in and of themselves suffice to address the application to strike out the first “sub-plot” of the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy.  But, be that as it may, I will proceed to explain why I find that the claims arising out of that first “sub-plot” are nonetheless also untenable on the basis of issue estoppel, even if one is to take the strict view that the claim in the Arbitration was one for breach of contract and is conceptually distinct from the claims for conspiracy pleaded in this suit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Of the requirements for issue estoppel outlined at [44] above, the first three are identical to the first three requirements for cause of action estoppel.  The analysis on whether those three requirements are met is therefore similar (see above from [61] to [66]), and I do not propose to repeat it here.  Rather, the central issue for present purposes is whether the fourth requirement, for identity of subject-matter, is met in relation to the first “sub-plot”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 At [34] to [35] of <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court provided the following guidance on the fourth requirement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[34] … Firstly, the issues must be identical in the sense that the prior decision must traverse the same ground as the subsequent proceeding and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the earlier decision must not have changed or should be incapable of change.  Where this is not the case, issue estoppel may not arise …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[35] The second idea which is contained within the requirement of an identity of subject-matter is that the previous determination in question must have been fundamental and not merely collateral to the previous decision so that the decision could not stand without that determination …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Turning first to whether the Arbitration traverses the same ground as the present proceeding in relation to the first “sub-plot”, I am of the view that it clearly does.

To the extent that any of these invalid ADs form the basis of a Termination Certificate, then notwithstanding that the Termination Certificate also relies on other ADs which are valid, that Certificate itself is invalid. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Conversely if the Termination Certificate is found to rely on certain ADs which are found to be invalid but the invalidity is not the result of any improper pressure or undue influence being applied on the Architect, the invalid ADs may be severed and the Termination Certificate remains valid for the purposes of terminating [the plaintiff’s] employment on the basis [of] the remaining valid ADs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The effect of this finding by the arbitrator cannot be overstated.  The arbitrator, in finding that the termination of the Contract was valid, found that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of the ADs relied on in Termination Certificates 260 and 262 were tainted by improper pressure and/or undue influence.  Put another way, the arbitrator rejected <span class="font-italic">any</span> suggestion that the third defendant had acted improperly under the influence of the first defendant or in a non-independent manner in relation to <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the ADs relied on in Termination Certificates 260 and 262.  In the present Suit, for the plaintiff to establish that there was a conspiracy, it would necessarily have to show that that the first defendant had asked for, and the architects had agreed to, the issuance of ADs which were not the product of their independent decision-making.  That would effectively require this Court to come to a view that is the opposite of what the arbitrator had found in relation to the independence of the third defendant and the validity of each of the ADs.  A finding of conspiracy in this Suit would therefore <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> impugn the arbitrator’s findings, which were fundamental to his decision in the Arbitration.  Such a collateral attack on a previous binding decision of a properly-constituted tribunal is precisely what the doctrine of issue estoppel seeks to prevent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In reaching this conclusion, I bore in mind the observation by the Court at [37] of <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([40] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In my judgment, the assessment of which side of the line an issue falls should be approached from a commonsensical perspective, balancing between the important public interest in securing finality and in ensuring that the same issues are not repeatedly litigated on one hand, and on the other, the private interest in not foreclosing a litigant from arguing an issue which, in substance, was not the central issue decided by a previous court …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Having reference to the full panoply of legal proceedings which have transpired between the parties, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has had ample opportunity to ventilate its entire suite of arguments.

</div>  I do not agree with the plaintiff’s counsel’s submission that finding an issue estoppel on the present facts would foreclose the plaintiff from arguing an issue which was not the central issue decided in the Arbitration.  Rather, it is quite the reverse – the plaintiff succeeding in Suit 1274 that there was a conspiracy <span class="font-italic">necessitates</span> a finding that the conspiracy gave rise to the termination of the Contract, which caused the plaintiff to suffer loss.  The plaintiff succeeding in the present suit would undoubtedly undermine the arbitrator’s findings that (a) there was no collusion, (b) the third defendant was independent in his decision-making, (c) none of the ADs were tainted and invalid by reason of improper pressure, (d) the first defendant’s termination of the Contract was therefore justified, and (e) that the plaintiff is accordingly not entitled to damages from the termination of the Contract.  I do not accept, given the totality of the circumstances, that the plaintiff should be permitted to re-litigate these points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Given my finding that all the requirements for issue estoppel are met in relation to the first “sub-plot”, I conclude that the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy relating to the first “sub-plot” are precluded on the basis of<span class="font-italic"> both</span> issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel (see [60] to [100] above).  I therefore agree with the first defendant that there is a proper basis to strike out those claims under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC.

</div>
</div>  The crux of the cause of action in the Arbitration was thus one which was logically <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the cause of action in the second “sub-plot”.  Specifically, the cause of action in the second “sub-plot”, namely the alleged conspiracy relating to the replacement tender and replacement costs, could only arise <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Contract was terminated.  I am thus not satisfied that there is adequate identity of causes of action between the second “sub-plot” and the claim in the Arbitration.  In any event, the first defendant does not appear to have seriously pursued its argument on cause of action estoppel specifically in the context of the second “sub-plot”, with the bulk of its submissions on cause of action estoppel going towards the first “sub-plot” instead. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Turning to issue estoppel in relation to the second “sub-plot”, the analysis on whether the first three requirements for issue estoppel are met largely mirrors what I have already outlined from [61] to [66] above.  All that I would add is in relation to the third requirement that there must be identity of parties.  It is fairly clear to me that when one examines the substance rather than the form of the second “sub-plot”, it pits the plaintiff on one hand and the first defendant on the other, with the second, sixth, seventh, eighth and/or ninth defendants being alleged to have colluded with the first defendant in relation the appointment of the sixth defendant as the replacement contractor and fixing the replacement tender price.  The centrality of the first defendant to both the Arbitration and to the second “sub-plot” of the alleged conspiracy is clear – the first defendant is after all the party with the most to gain from the alleged second “sub-plot” given that it is the party which receives the moneys claimed under the performance bond.  I am thus satisfied that there is identity of parties in relation to the second “sub-plot”.  The crux of my analysis in relation to issue estoppel in the context of the second “sub-plot” is therefore on the remaining requirement, that is, on whether there is identity of subject-matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Arbitration, and in particular the tribunal’s findings in Partial Award 3, traverses the same ground that the plaintiff is seeking to rely on for the second “sub-plot”.  Partial Award 3 concerns the quantum phase of the Arbitration, where the tribunal had the task of determining what sums were due to either the plaintiff or the first defendant, flowing from his findings on liability in Partial Award 1.  The plaintiff made two main allegations on this matter at the Arbitration: first, that the first defendant had already decided to appoint the sixth defendant as the replacement contractor even before any tender, and second, that the costs that the plaintiff had purported to pay the new contractor, the sixth defendant, were inflated and excessive.  The plaintiff also alleged the involvement of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the second, sixth, and ninth defendants in the appointment of the sixth defendant as the replacement main contractor. Specifically, the plaintiff pointed to a “series of exchanges between the [second defendant] and the [first defendant’s] Quantity Surveyor [the ninth defendant] on 6 September 2014 [referring] to an ‘express negotiation’ between the [first defendant] and the [sixth defendant]” for the purpose of “stack[ing] the deck in favour of the [sixth defendant]”.

In particular, the tribunal found that there was no impropriety with the first defendant’s appointment of the sixth defendant as the replacement main contractor.  Further, the tribunal specifically considered whether the sums claimed by the first defendant arising from the appointment of the sixth defendant as the replacement main contractor were unreasonable and/or inflated when the issue of the net amount due (taking into account the amount paid under the performance bond) between the plaintiff and first defendant was determined.  I will illustrate how the tribunal’s approach in Partial Award 3 is directly relevant to the instant proceedings by outlining the plaintiff’s arguments before the tribunal, the tribunal’s findings, and how those findings give rise to issue estoppels. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In the Arbitration, the plaintiff made, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following arguments as to the costs incurred in order to complete the Project after the plaintiff’s termination as main contractor (the “replacement costs”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first defendant’s replacement costs were “excessive” and “failed to properly take into account”, among other things, “the value and nature of works completed by the [plaintiff]”, “the value and nature of outstanding works to be completed by the replacement contractor”, “the value of plant, machinery, equipment, tools and material left on site by the [plaintiff] at the point of termination”, “the value of any alleged rectification works required to be carried out by the replacement contractor” and “the value and nature of work that the replacement contractor tendered for in its bid proposals”.

Insofar as the tribunal was of the view that certain claims as to the replacement costs were inflated, those claims were accordingly reduced.  Where the tribunal disagreed that elements of the replacement costs were inflated or unwarranted, they were maintained.  This led ultimately to the tribunal’s determination that the reasonable costs of completing the entire Project was S$88,915,291.44.

</div>  Because the first defendant had already been paid S$8,806,383.30 under the performance bond, the net amount due from the first defendant to be plaintiff was, after accounting for GST and the liquidated damages due, S$6,492,392.20. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Each of the tribunal’s findings in relation to each of the elements of the replacement costs outlined from [108(a)] to [108(e)] above is capable of giving rise to an issue estoppel.  Each of those findings is fundamental to the tribunal’s eventual decision as to the reasonable sum payable to the replacement contractor to complete the project, and hence the sum payable by the first defendant to the plaintiff after accounting for the first defendant’s call on the performance bond.  Had the tribunal reached a different position on <span class="font-italic">any </span>of the elements of the replacement costs outlined above, its conclusions as to the relevant sums payable, which was the very issue it was supposed to determine in the quantum phase of the Arbitration, would have been different.  Put another way, it logically flows that the tribunal’s determinations as to the appropriate quantum for the <span class="font-italic">components</span> of the overall cost of completion would be fundamental to the eventual overall cost of completion (and amount of shortfall payable by the first defendant after accounting for the performance bond). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The tribunal has therefore already traversed the issue of whether or not the replacement costs are inflated, and has reached several specific findings on that point.  Among other things, the tribunal did in fact find that a number of elements of the replacement costs were overpriced (see for example, [108(d)] above), and reduced the sum that the plaintiff was liable for accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In Suit 1274, the plaintiff’s case is that the costs of the replacement tender are inflated, and that the inflated sum was reached pursuant to a conspiracy between the first, second, sixth, seventh, eighth and/or ninth defendants.  The Court is asked to award damages on the basis of that conspiracy and the inflated claim on the performance bond that arose as a result.  The plaintiff’s claims for this second “sub-plot” therefore require an assessment of (i) whether the replacement costs are in fact inflated, <span class="font-italic">and</span> (ii) whether that inflation was pursuant to a conspiracy.  However, what the plaintiff’s argument ignores is that the tribunal has adjudicated <span class="font-italic">the precise issue </span>of whether the replacement costs are inflated in determining the reasonable replacement costs and ultimate quantum payable in Partial Award 3.  I am not satisfied that the Court should have to re-assess each element of the replacement costs to determine whether that element has been inflated, when the tribunal has already done so.  The tribunal has in fact <span class="font-italic">already </span>provided a legal remedy to the plaintiff by reducing the amount claimed by the first defendant as replacement costs in the Arbitration, and any remedy sought in relation to the second “sub-plot” in Suit 1274 would thus entail potential double-recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 My findings in this regard are buttressed by the fact that the issues underlying the reliefs sought by the plaintiff in relation to the second “sub-plot” have, for all intents and purposes, been subsumed by the plaintiff’s claims in relation to the first “sub-plot”.  These issues have already been dealt with by the tribunal.  To recapitulate, the plaintiff seeks the following reliefs in relation to the second “sub-plot”:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Loss and damage caused by the conduct of the replacement tender and the appointment of the sixth defendant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Interest costs arising out of and/or related to the call on the Performance Bond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As for the plaintiff’s claims for loss and damage caused by the conduct of the replacement tender and the appointment of the sixth defendant, the plaintiff’s position is that the main loss arising is that, but for the conduct of the replacement tender, the first defendant “would have no basis to call on the Performance Bond in the manner and to the extent that it did”.

</div>  This claim for damages therefore fundamentally collapses into a claim for losses suffered as a result of the claim under the performance bond, and such a claim was already addressed by the tribunal through its determination in Partial Award 3 that the first defendant ought to pay S$6,405,536.34 to the plaintiff because it had over-claimed on the performance bond (see [18] above).  The tribunal has therefore <span class="font-italic">already</span> determined the various issues which, in aggregate, determined the reasonable amount which could be claimed under the performance bond, and which gave rise to its eventual conclusion as to the applicable remedies.  The plaintiff appears to simply be trying to re-litigate this point.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The plaintiff’s claim for interest costs arising out of and/or related to the call on the performance bond may be fairly quickly dealt with because it was once again specifically adjudicated on by the tribunal.  The tribunal found that the plaintiff was not entitled to such interest costs in view of cl 3.5.9 of the Contract, which provides that “the Employer … shall not for any reason whatsoever be liable for any interest on the over-payment …” even if the Employer, in this case the first defendant, was overpaid.

</div> The tribunal’s determination on this point effectively addresses an issue the plaintiff needs to traverse in its claim for interest costs, namely whether such interest costs are permissible under the terms of the Contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In sum, my analysis on the relief sought by the plaintiff in relation to the second “sub-plot” underscores why, on a holistic assessment of the facts (see [100] above), issue estoppel applies in relation to the second “sub-plot”.  Not only is the plaintiff relying on issues determined by the tribunal which were fundamental to the tribunal’s decision, the remedies it is seeking in relation to the second “sub-plot” require the Court to re-traverse issues which have already been decided at the Arbitration.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I therefore find that issue estoppel operates on the instant facts to bar the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy in relation to this second “sub-plot” as raised in Suit 1274.  I am also of the view that, as with above at [91], nothing turns on the fact that the plaintiff is bringing claims in both lawful and unlawful means conspiracy in relation to the second “sub-plot”.  I therefore agree with the first defendant that there is sound basis on this ground to strike out the plaintiff’s claims in relation to the second “sub-plot” under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Extended doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Having found that both issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel apply to bar the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy against the defendants, it is not necessary for me to consider the parties’ arguments as to whether the plaintiff’s claims in conspiracy on both the first and second “sub-plots” should also be struck out on the basis of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>.  In this regard, I am guided by the Court of Appeal’s position in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotl</span><span class="font-italic">and NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [102] that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> extends beyond cause of action and issue estoppel “… to cases where [a particular] point was <span class="font-italic">not</span> raised in the earlier proceedings even though it could and should have been…” (emphasis added).  Given my finding that the relevant points giving rise to both cause of action and issue estoppel <span class="font-italic">were</span> in fact raised at the Arbitration, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> does not arise on the instant facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s claim in the tort of intimidation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I turn now to the plaintiff’s claim in the tort of intimidation against the first defendant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Before I consider the first defendant’s application, it bears reiteration that the plaintiff has discontinued its action against the second defendant (see [22] above).  This was done sometime after the second defendant’s striking out application against the plaintiff (Summons No 5859 of 2019) was withdrawn in the course of the hearing.  The remaining issue before me is therefore whether the plaintiff’s claim in the tort of intimidation against the <span class="font-italic">first</span> defendant should be struck out.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The starting point in assessing the plaintiff’s claim in intimidation is an examination of the elements of the tort.  The first element is that the threat must be coercive in nature for the plaintiff to do something to his/her detriment, and the second is that the plaintiff must have in fact complied with the threat, to his/her detriment: <span class="font-italic">Ten </span><span class="font-italic">Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie v National University of Singapore</span> [2018] SGHC 158 at [110] and [111]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As has been rightly pointed out by the first defendant, even if one were to take the plaintiff’s pleaded case at its highest, there are only <span class="font-italic">two</span> instances where Mr Arasu, the Managing Director of the plaintiff, actually complied with the threats allegedly made by the second defendant: the acts relating to the first and second “ang pows”.  These two episodes relating to the first and second “ang pows” are the <span class="font-italic">only </span>instances raised by the plaintiff where it, any of its contractors or sub-contractors, and/or Mr Arasu complied with any of the alleged threats by the second defendant.  All the other pleaded instances of threats did not involve any compliance on the part of the recipients of the threats.  Unsurprisingly thus, during oral argument before me, counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that demands made by the second defendant which were <span class="font-italic">not</span> complied with would not give rise to claims in intimidation, and indicated that the plaintiff would therefore only be relying on the incident in relation to the first “ang pow” as the basis for its claim in intimidation.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The first three of the first defendant’s arguments in this regard may be fairly swiftly dealt with.  All three arguments entail highly fact-specific findings, such as whether there was a coercive threat in the first place, whether the S$15,000 in the first “ang pow” was from Mr Arasu’s own funds or was loss suffered by the plaintiff, and whether the relationship between the second and first defendants was such that the first defendant should be vicariously liable for the second defendant asking for an “ang pow” from Mr Arasu.  Given the questions of fact involved, I am of the view that assessing these issues at trial is the appropriate course of action.  That would allow the entirety of the facts to be considered before the Court so that it can make the relevant findings as to what precisely occurred in relation to this incident and, in particular, what was actually said between the two persons involved and what the source of the funds for the “ang pow” was.  These factual issues are disputed.  Thus, I am not satisfied that this is a “plain and obvious” case of the type envisaged in <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span> ([31] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) for striking out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I am also not convinced that issue estoppel applies in relation to this incident regarding the first “ang pow” because I do not accept that the arbitrator’s findings on the interaction between the second defendant and the plaintiff’s Mr Arasu were <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> to his eventual conclusions.  Put simply, the arbitrator was ascertaining whether or not the architects had acted under improper pressure in issuing the ADs and Notices.  His assessment of the <span class="font-italic">second defendant’s interactions with Mr </span><span class="font-italic">Arasu</span> were not fundamental to his conclusion that the architects had behaved properly and were not influenced by the second defendant.  In other words, the arbitrator could have reached his central conclusion in Partial Award 1 that the architects had acted independently and not under any improper influence <span class="font-italic">even if</span> he had reached a completely different position on the interactions between the second defendant and Mr Arasu. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The point I make is underscored by the arbitrator’s own explanation of his position <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the second defendant’s behaviour towards Mr Arasu and the plaintiff’s employees and/or agents.

The issue of gratification is <span class="font-italic">at best an ancillary issue</span> because for the purpose of this arbitration, the two issues which the Tribunal has to address is [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] whether [the second defendant] is capable of influencing the Architect in the course of discharging his certification duties and secondly <span class="font-italic">whether the Architect was in fact influenced by [the second defendant] in carrying out these duties</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen from this extract, the arbitrator was clear that the focus of his assessment was on the architects and whether or not they had behaved under the improper influence of the second defendant.  The second defendant’s exchange with the plaintiff’s Mr Arasu was merely “ancillary”.  I accordingly do not accept that the arbitrator’s findings on this narrow issue of the second defendant’s exchanges with Mr Arasu were <span class="font-italic">fundamental</span> to his eventual conclusions, and reject the first defendant’s reliance on issue estoppel to strike out this claim for intimidation in relation to the incident concerning the first “ang pow”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As for the final basis on which the first defendant seeks the striking out of the plaintiff’s claim in intimidation, I am not satisfied that the first defendant has clearly and convincingly shown that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> unquestionably applies to the claim.  Put another way, the first defendant has not crossed the high hurdle for striking out, that is, it has not persuaded me that the plaintiff’s claim for intimidation in relation to the first “ang pow” is undoubtedly barred by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and is thus a hopeless claim.  In my view, without the benefit of fuller argument, it is not entirely clear that the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">should</span> have raised a specific claim in intimidation for the first “ang pow” at the Arbitration given that the second defendant, who is alleged to be the primary tortfeasor, was not party to the arbitration.  The liability of the secondary tortfeasor, the first defendant in this case, is premised on and secondary to the liability of the primary tortfeasor, the second defendant on the instant facts.  As the Court of Appeal observed at [41] of <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Munib Mohammad Madni and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1074, vicarious liability is a form of “secondary liability” which holds a defendant “<span class="font-italic">liable for the negligence of another</span> even if the defendant has not been negligent at all” (emphasis added).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In fact, the first defendant’s arguments on the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in relation to the plaintiff’s claims in intimidation raise an interesting question of law concerning the nature of secondary liability in the context of vicarious liability, and whether or not that secondary liability should be pursued in arbitration even if the primary tortfeasor is not a party to the arbitration.  This question was not satisfactorily addressed before me.  As the authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span> observe at [18/19/6], “[i]f an action contains a point of law which requires serious argument, it is not appropriate to strike it out”.  In a similar vein, this Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Internet Ltd v Catcha.com Pte Ltd</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 980 at [14], in the context of a dispute over, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, copyright infringement and the use of website linking technology, that “[t]here is therefore novelty in both law and the technology of deep linking of websites, both of which require the most rigorous examination and scrutiny which only a full trial can ensure”.  On the present facts, I am not persuaded that the plaintiff’s claim in intimidation relating to the first “ang pow” should be struck out without there having been full argument on the potential legal complexity that arises in relation to secondary liability as outlined above.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I note for completeness that it will be open to the first defendant, if it so chooses, to pursue this point that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applies at the trial of the plaintiff’s claim for intimidation.  The point I make is simply that it is premature <span class="font-italic">at this stage</span> in proceedings to strike out the plaintiff’s claim in full given the high threshold required for striking out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 On balance, I find that there is no basis for the first defendant to seek to strike out the plaintiff’s claim in intimidation as relates to the first “ang pow”.  The plaintiff should have the opportunity to proceed to trial on this claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 As for the other factual bases pleaded by the plaintiff which it relied on to support its claim in intimidation (including those outlined from [119(b)] to [119(e)] above), I am satisfied following the analysis from [121] to [122] above that they should be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC as disclosing no reasonable cause of action and/or being legally unsustainable (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati</span> at [39]).  As counsel for the plaintiff rightly acknowledged, the only viable factual basis for the claim in intimidation is that relating to the first “ang pow”.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> plays an important role in Singapore’s legal framework.

Dispute resolution proceedings have proceeded for an extended period of time, and parties have been subjected to rigorous cross-examination for the distilling of facts.  I do not accept that the first defendant should be subjected to litigation on the exact same factual matrix when the substance of those claims has already been determined at the Arbitration, nor am I able to accept that the plaintiff should be permitted to argue claims in conspiracy which, if accepted, would <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> impugn the findings of the arbitrator as to the validity of the Contract’s termination and the proper allocation of the losses arising from the termination.
