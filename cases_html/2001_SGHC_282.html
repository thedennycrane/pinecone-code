<i xmlns=""><b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>Introductory

</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1 In a writ filed in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore, the plaintiff

Datuk Captain Hamzah Bin Mohd Noor, apparently a much-decorated businessman, resident in Malaysia,

claims against Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskander Al-Haj, the Crown Prince of Johor,

Malaysia, a sum well in excess of US$8 million allegedly for services rendered, loans and advances

made and amounts expended by the plaintiff for and at the request of the defendant. From the

statement of claim filed, it would appear that whatever agreements reached between the plaintiff and

the defendant were all verbal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The defendant after entering appearance in this suit applied to the court to

stay proceedings on grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. This contention by him was that the

appropriate forum to try the plaintiffs claim was either Malaysia or Indonesia and never

Singapore. The defendant prevailed before the learned assistant registrar. The plaintiffs appeal

and further arguments before me were not successful for the reasons which follow.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b>Tour dhorizon</b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Before I set out the reasons for my decision, it would, perhaps be useful to

state briefly the background facts as can be gathered from the plaintiffs statement of claim and

from the affidavits filed by parties in these proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The plaintiff is a former Harbour Master in the State of Johor. He got along

famously with the Johor Royal Household, at least until recently. His services and friendship did

not go unnoticed and due recognition was given to him when he was conferred Johors third highest

honour award of <i>Setia Makhota Johor</i> by His Royal Highness the Sultan of Johor on his birthday

honour lists in 1984. When the Sultan of Johor became the King of Malaysia, ("<i>the Yang

Dipertuan Agung</i>"), the plaintiff was further honoured in 1987 by the King with Malaysias

First Class Honour Award of <i>Panglima Setia Diraja</i>, an award which entitled him to the title <i>Datuk</i>.

He states his residential address as 2A Jalan SS3/2, Taman Sentosa, Petaling Jaya, Selangor,

Malaysia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The defendant is the eldest son of the Sultan of Johor and bears the royal

title <i>Tunku Mahkota Johor</i> or <i>TMJ</i>. He is next in line and the heir to the throne of the

State of Johor. He resides in a palace in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, known as the Istana Pasir Pelangi.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, besides

being a prince, is also a businessman and an investor in various commercial ventures for gain and

profit. He claims that he was the defendants personally appointed and acknowledged representative

in a number of commercial projects, ventures and investments in return for remuneration and payment

of expenses to him. Quite a few projects were listed by him in this regard, chief amongst them was

an oil and gas project in Indonesia which he calls the Petrogas Project. More shall be heard

on this later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The plaintiffs statement of claim is an extremely long and rambling 119-page

(408 paragraphs) document. He sets out in it rather laboriously the various services rendered by him

to the defendant from about September 1994; the promises made by the defendant and the sums

disbursed by him for and at the request of the defendant. The breakdown of the plaintiffs claim

is as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The sum of US$805,000.00 being the salary or remuneration due from the

  Defendant to the Plaintiff for work done and services rendered by the Plaintiff to the Defendant

  pursuant to the contract for service between the Plaintiff and the Defendant at the rate of

  US$35,000.00 per month for 23 months from September 1994 to July 1996;</p>
<p align="justify">2. The sum of RM450,000.00 being the balance allowances due from the Defendant

  to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and incorporated into the contract for service at

  the rate of RM10,000.00 per month for 45 months from January 1996 to September 1999;</p>
<p align="justify">3. The sum of US$5,000,000.00 being the lump sum money due from the Defendant

  to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and incorporated into thecontract for service;</p>
<p align="justify">4. The sum of US$1,000,000.00 being the lump sum money due from the Defendant

  to the Plaintiff as agreed by the Defendant and incorporated into the contract for service;</p>
<p align="justify">5. The sum of US$900,000.00 being the additional lump sum money due from the

  Defendant to the Plaintiff as agreed to by the Defendant and incorporated into the contract for

  service;</p>
<p align="justify">6. The sum of RM832,542.16 and the sum of US$140,966.00 being monies advanced

  by the Plaintiff on the Defendants behalf and on the Defendants instructions pertaining to

  the Petrogas Project and the Defendants various other matters and investments;</p>
<p align="justify">7. The sum of RM8,905.00 being the reimbursable expenses incurred by the

  Plaintiff in the performance of his duties for the Defendant with the Defendants authority and

  permission;</p>
<p align="justify">8. The sum of US$200,000.00 extended by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a

  personal loan on or about 5 April 1995;</p>
<p align="justify">9. The sum of US$220,000.00 extended by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as a

  personal loan on 16 June 1995;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 The total amount of the claim is for US$8,300,966 and M$1,301,447.16.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 The pleaded facts and the affidavits filed by the parties suggest that some

time in November 1994, the plaintiff introduced the Petrogas Project to the defendant at the latters

office at Mados Sdn Bhd, situated at Jalan Pasir Pelangi, Johor Bahru and subsequently arranged for

the defendant to meet one Praptono Tjitrohupojo (Praptono), an Indonesian national, who is the

president director and majority shareholder of an Indonesian corporation known as PT Usaha Putra

Indonesia Petrogas (UPG). The upshot was UPG was given four technical assistance contracts (TAC) to

explore, develop, produce and sell the oil and gas from four different oil and gas concessions in

Indonesia which collectively constituted the Petrogas Project and in this regard the defendant

agreed to and caused to be provided loans amounting to US$26.5 million to the subsidiaries of UPG.

In all this, the plaintiff claims that he acted as the defendants representative. The plaintiff

further claims that a considerable amount of work was done by him for the defendant in relation to

the defendants intended participation and subsequent involvement in the ventures mentioned.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The plaintiff maintains that he actively participated in and attended several

meetings relating to the defendants affairs including one held in the meeting room of the Raffles

Marina Singapore, on 27 November 1994, for the finalisation of negotiations between the defendant

and UPG, which culminated in the execution of the first of the four loan agreements. The details

provided by the plaintiff in his statement of claim as to works carried out by him allegedly for and

on behalf of the defendant and the personages he met are too long to be entered upon here. Suffice

it, if it is said he made a number of trips to Singapore for meetings in connection with his

purported brief. He claims that the defendant almost entirely depended on the team comprising the

plaintiff, one of the defendants then legal advisors, Mr Andre Arul (who is curiously the current

counsel for the plaintiff) and a few others to oversee the legal, economic and financial aspects of

the transaction.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 The plaintiff also recounts in his statement of claim the pivotal role he

played in the negotiations leading up to the finalization of the four loan agreements mentioned. He

sets out in detail the negotiations he conducted, all of them on behalf of and upon the instructions

of the defendant, with various overseas financial institutions, advisers and investors including

Prince Jefri of Brunei who in the result provided funds totalling US$45 million in two tranches for

the Petrogas Project. He mentioned that he also had to represent the defendant in negotiations with

a number of energy corporations in many countries and arranged to incorporate five offshore

companies in the British Virgin Islands, collectively known as "Crown BVI" and two other

companies in Malaysia, known as Crown Energy Holding Sdn Bhd (Crown Malaysia) and Luxury Marketing

Sdn Bhd (LMSB) to safeguard the defendants interests in Petrogas Project as well as others. In

addition, the plaintiff also met people at the highest levels of government and industry in Malaysia

as well as in Indonesia. Prominent personalities he had met in this regard included Dato Seri Anwar,

the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia as well as General Try Sutrisno, the then Vice

President of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 As a result of Prince Jefri not willing to pour in further funds, (the

expected inflow was US$230 million), the Petrogas Project reportedly floundered. On 31 July 1995,

the defendant caused to be assigned to Crown Malaysia all of the defendants debt of US$26.5

million from UPG and all his rights, powers, privileges, options and obligations under each of the

four loan agreements executed between the defendant, UPG and Praptono. Following the collapse of the

Petrogas Project, since about 31 July 1995, the plaintiff, on behalf of the defendant, had been

seeking the return of the loans extended to the Petrogas group of companies in the sum of US$26.5

million plus interest in accordance with the terms of the respective loan agreements made between

the defendant, UPG and Praptono. However, as of 5 October 1999, the plaintiff ceased to act any

further on behalf of the defendant owing to the defendants failure to pay any of the plaintiffs

salary, the balance of his allowance, reimbursement of his costs and expenses incurred on the

defendants behalf, the plaintiffs personal loans to the defendant and other monetary

commitments made by the defendant to him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 The plaintiff also sketches out in the statement of claim some other services

rendered by him to the defendant in connection with the defendants various projects and

undertakings. These include matters relating to some twenty-seven parcels of land belonging to the

defendant and hosts of other projects which require no further amplification at this stage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 As could be observed from the final segment of the plaintiffs statement of

claim (pages 117 and 118), his claims appear to comprise, in the main, nine items besides his

consequential claims for damages, costs and interests.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 As regards the first claim for US$805,000 allegedly for salary or remuneration

at the rate of US$35,000 a month from September 1994 to July 1996, the plaintiff alleges at 271 of

the statement of claim that on or about 10 December 1994, the defendant met the plaintiff and

Praptono at the "<i>The Last Chukka</i>", (which according to counsel is situated at

Istana Pasir Pelangi, Johor Bahru) and confirmed that he would be paid a monthly salary of US$35,000

a month by the defendant personally. As regards the second claim for M$450,000 the plaintiff states

at para 342 of the statement of claim that on 2 June 1995, during a car ride from the Seletar

Airport to Istana Pasir Plangi, Johor Bahru, the defendant told the plaintiff that the latter would

be paid a monthly allowance to meet his outgoings and expenses incurred in Malaysia in relation to

the Petrogas Project and this was further confirmed when the defendant later arrived at Istana Pasir

Pelangi where he instructed one Ungku Yusoff in this regard.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 As concerns the third claim for a lump sum payment for US$5,000000, the

plaintiff says at para 346 of the statement of claim that the defendant also during the same car

ride on 2 June 1995, from Seletar to Johor Bahru mentioned in the preceding para, said that he would

pay the plaintiff an additional sum of US$5,000,000 for his efforts in relation to the Petrogas

Project. In respect of the fourth claim for a further lumpsum of US$1,000,000, the plaintiff avers

at paras 349 and 350 of the statement of claim that this sum was promised to him in recognition of

the plaintiffs efforts concerning the Petrogas Project. This promise, he says, was made to him by

the defendant in the latters office at Johor Bahru in the presence of one Mr Salleh and one of

the defendants personal secretaries, Ms Halimah binti Ahmad.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 As regards his fifth claim for a sum of US$900,000, the plaintiff mentions in

para 352 of the statement of claim that on 28 April 1995, the defendant also verbally promised to

pay him an additional sum of US$900,000 since the defendant had fallen behind in his contractual

payments to the plaintiff. Dealing with his sixth claim for two sums of M$832,542.16 and

US$140,966.00, being monies allegedly advanced by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant upon the

latters instructions in connection with the Petrogas Project, the plaintiff itemizes them in

paras 358 to 376 of the statement of claim. With regard to his seventh claim for a sum of

M$8,905.00, the plaintiff mentions in para 378 of the statement of claim, that this was an

outstanding sum payable for some air tickets, bought in the performance of his duties for the

defendant. As respects his eighth claim for US$200,000 the plaintiff states at paragraphs 387 to 389

of the statement of claim that this was a personal loan extended by him to the defendant at the

latters Mados office in Johor Bahru and the whole sum in cash was handed at that office to one Ms

Tan who received the said sum on behalf of the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 The ninth claim by him is for US$220,000. In this regard, the plaintiff in

paras 397 to 407 of his statement of claim states that he paid this sum to UPG in Jakarta upon the

express request of the defendant and the defendant has failed so far to return the said sum to him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 As regards evidence to be adduced in relation to the current dispute, the

plaintiff does not seem to agree with the list of potential witnesses provided by the defendant in

para 18 of his affidavit where the defendant has named altogether 11 witnesses: 6 Malaysian

residents (excluding himself and the plaintiff), 3 Indonesian residents, one Singapore resident and

one from Scotland. The plaintiff for his part adds another 28 to his list: (excluding himself and

defendant, both of them from Malaysia), three from Brunei Darussalam, four from Canada, one from New

Zealand, eleven from Singapore, eight from the US and one from UK.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Defendants application</p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 The defendants application to court is based on para 9 of the First

Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) which reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><b>Stay of proceedings</b></p>
<p align="justify">9. Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res

  judicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity of proceedings in any court or

  courts or by reason of a court in Singapore not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought

  not to be continued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 The submission by the defendant that given the entire spectrum, background and

character of the dealings between the contestants, Singapore is not the appropriate forum to

litigate the dispute at hand. This argument was accepted as valid by the learned assistant

registrar. In the appeal before me, counsel for the plaintiff endeavoured to persuade me that on the

basis of the evidence placed before the court by the plaintiff, Singapore is the natural and the

most appropriate forum for the present action to be tried. A synopsis of his arguments is as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) <b>Witnesses:</b> The main witnesses for the present proceedings are the

  plaintiff, the defendant, Salleh and Praptono (the first three being Malaysian residents and the

  last being an Indonesian resident). Other witnesses are reluctant to testify in Malaysia but are

  willing to testify in Singapore (para 41 of appellants submission).</p>
<p align="justify">(b) <b>Events:</b> The major events pertaining to the plaintiffs claim did

  not occur only in Malaysia but in Singapore as well. Main bulk of the plaintiffs claim against

  the defendant is for the sum of US$5,000,000 which the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff

  during a car ride between Seletar airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi in Johor (paras 43 and 44 of the

  submission).</p>
<p align="justify">(c) <b>Governing law of the loan agreements:</b> Several of the drafts of the

  Master Agreements stipulated that the law of England to be the governing law for the same. The

  arbitration clauses too provided for the UNICTRAL Rules in Singapore to apply (paras 45 and 46 of

  the submission).</p>
<p align="justify">(d) <b>Assets of parties: The defendant has not provided any details to support

  his contention that he has substantial assets in Malaysia</b>. On the contrary, the plaintiff has

  evidence that the defendants have substantial assets in Singapore (para 49 of the submission).</p>
<p align="justify">(e) <b>Excessive delay in Malaysia:</b> There is a huge backlog of cases in the

  Malaysian Courts and there is likely to be an inordinate delay in the prosecution of the plaintiffs

  claim (para 59 of the submission).</p>
<p align="justify">(f) <b>The defendants privileged position in Malaysia:</b> The defendant is

  the Crown Prince of Johor. He may ascend the Johor Throne before the conclusion of the trial and

  in the result he will be granted immunity against any proceedings in Malaysia (para 62 of the

  submission).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 When asked to state where the agreement relating to the subject matter of the

claim was concluded, plaintiffs counsel invited the courts attention to para 346 of the

statement of claim which states that the promise by the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum under

reference was made during a car ride from the Singapore Seletar Airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi,

Johor. Plaintiffs counsel also confirmed that the plaintiffs various claims in the statement

of claim are founded on oral agreements and variations of the said oral agreements between the

plaintiff and the defendant. Interestingly, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that there is in

existence a draft agreement (exh TMJ-7 in the affidavit of the defendant filed on 23 April 2000)

prepared in relation to this matter by him, which is signed by the plaintiff but not by the

defendant. I shall revert to this draft later in these grounds.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 Counsel for the defendant in his submission underscored the aspect that both

the contestants featured in this case are Malaysian residents and the other principal figure

Praptono is an Indonesian. The draft agreement in relation to the subject matter prepared by

plaintiffs counsel, signed by the plaintiff and forwarded to the defendant for execution but not

signed by him, clearly stipulates that the governing law of the agreement between the parties is

Malaysia and the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Malaysia (see cl 10 of

the draft contract in the exh TMJ-7 referred to). To dispel any doubt as to the course to be adopted

by the defendant, his counsel also reaffirmed his clients intention that he would submit to the

jurisdiction of the courts in Malaysia. Counsel further invited the attention of the court to a

significant feature that the four loan agreements which form the backdrop to the plaintiffs claim

and alleged agreement for services in relation to them concern matters outside Singapore. After

further highlighting the fact that Praptono has also filed a claim against the defendant in Malaysia

as respects Pratponos purported claims against the defendant, he urged the court to rule that

Singapore is decidedly not the most appropriate forum to try the dispute between that parties and

suggested Malaysia as being the most appropriate forum, if not Indonesia.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Decision</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 It would appear from the arguments presented before me that the plaintiffs

principal reason for choosing to proceed against the defendant in Singapore and not Malaysia is due

to his apprehension that the defendant may have an overwhelming advantage over him in Malaysia by

virtue of his princely status. The other reason pressed before me was that the courts in Malaysia

are unable to dispose of the cases expeditiously as there is a substantial backlog of cases there.

The question that needs to be answered here is whether the foregoing grievances justify this court

in holding Singapore as the most appropriate forum. The principles of law applicable in this regard

are set out by the House of Lords in England in <i><b>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd, The

Spiliada</b></i> [1986] 3 All ER 843.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 In <i><b>The Spiliada</b></i> the House of Lords was primarily concerned with

issues relating to the granting of leave under O 11 r 1(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1970

to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction. All the same, the Law Lords held in that case that the

principles governing the granting of such leave were the same as those applicable to a stay of

English proceedings. Lord Goff of Chievely who delivered the main speech, restated the law on this

matter which is succinctly encapsulated in the third cumulative supplement to <i><b>Dicey &amp;

Morris on Conflict of Laws</b></i> (11<sup>th</sup> Ed) at paras 393-395 as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i>(a) the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the

  ground of forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other available

  forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action,

  ie in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interest of all the parties and the ends

  of justice;

  <p align="justify">(b) the legal burden of proof is on the defendant, but the evidential burden

  will rest on the party who asserts the existence of a relevant factor;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the burden is on the defendant to show both that England is not the natural

  or appropriate forum, and also that there is another available forum which is clearly or

  distinctly more appropriate than the English forum;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) the court will look to see what factors there are which point to the

  direction of another forum, as being the forum with which the action has the most real and

  substantial connection, eg factors affecting convenience or expense (such as availability of

  witnesses), the law governing the transaction, and the places where the parties reside or carry on

  business;</p>
<p align="justify">(e) if at that stage the court concludes that there is no other available forum

  which is clearly more appropriate it will ordinarily refuse a stay;</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 The principles stated in <i><b>The</b></i> <i><b>Spiliada</b></i> have been

<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 In <i><b>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</b></i> (<i>supra</i>)

it was held:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The principles governing an application to stay proceedings were clear and

  established. If a court concluded that there was some other available forum which prima facie was

  clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it would ordinarily grant a stay unless

  there were circumstances by reason of which justice required that a stay should nevertheless not

  be granted. However, the mere fact that a plaintiff had such a legitimate advantage for proceeding

  in Singapore was not decisive and the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice had to

  be taken into consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 Earlier, in <i><b>The Vishva Apurva</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6208&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 175</a>, the Singapore

Court of Appeal held that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In exercising its discretion, the court should take into account all the

  circumstances of the case, in particular, the country where the evidence is most readily

  available, whether the foreign law applies and whether it is different from the local law in any

  material aspects, which country the parties are connected with, and how closely whether the

  defendants genuinely desire trial in the foreign country or are only seeking procedural

  advantages, and whether the plaintiffs would be prejudiced by having to sue in the foreign court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 Reviewing all the learning referred to, it would appear that the focus of all

of the cases cited revolves around the following aspects:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the place where the underlying transaction and cause of action arose;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the location of the witnesses who would testify to the facts;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the residence of the parties to the action; and</p>
<p align="justify">(d) the law governing the dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 As to where the transaction and the cause of action arose, the plaintiffs

claim is at its weakest. His claim that the alleged promise was made to him during a car ride from

the Singapore Seletar Airport to the defendants Malaysian residence in Johor is far from

conclusive. Although the plaintiff did assert that the alleged agreement was made while they were

still on Singapore soil, I find it difficult to accept that two highly placed Malaysian dignitaries

on a car ride from Singapore to the palace of one of the contestants would have even contemplated at

that point in time that the agreement, if any, between them will have the Singapore umbrella.

Probabilities do not favour the conclusion that they would have intended at that stage to apply

Singapore laws or to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of Singapore courts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 As to the residential status of the parties to the action it has never been in

dispute that both the plaintiff and the defendant are Malaysian residents. As to the law governing

the dispute, the plaintiffs claim is that it has always been the parties intention that the

applicable law to any dispute resolution would be that of Singapore. In this regard the plaintiff

strives to draw support from the reported perceptions and understandings of Praptono. Paragraph 13

of Praptonos affidavit of 18 April 2001 relied on by plaintiffs counsel in this respect reads

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I aver that at all times, it was contemplated between the Plaintiff, the

  Defendant and I that any disputes arising out of the Petrogas Project would be adjudged in

  Singapore and nowhere else. It was also my understanding that all further contractual matters,

  including as regards the arrangements between the Defendant and the Plaintiff herein, between the

  Defendant and Andre Arul and between the Defendant and Don were also to be resolved in Singapore

  other than any jurisdiction in precedence over Malaysia or Indonesia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 As regards the foregoing assertion, if what Praptono alleges were to be true

and accurate, why then in the draft agreement, (admittedly prepared in 1995 by the plaintiffs

present counsel on the instructions of the plaintiff and forwarded to the defendant for his

signature by the plaintiff on 3 June 1998, that too having already been signed by the plaintiff) is

there a clause unequivocally stipulating that the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant <i>shall

be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of Malaysia and the parties

shall submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the States of Malaysia in all matters connected

with the obligations and liabilities of the parties under the agreement referred to</i>. This

document clearly belies the plaintiffs present stand and indeed weakens the very foundation of

the plaintiffs present endeavours. The damage control attempted by his counsel by an explanation

that this document was yet to be signed, was found by me to be hopelessly inadequate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 The next aspect pursued by plaintiffs counsel was that (i) the plaintiff

stands in a rather vulnerable position in Malaysia, since the defendant by virtue of his birth and

being the Crown Prince of Johor could overwhelm the plaintiff; (ii) the defendant might well ascend

the throne of Johor in the near future and in such an event the proceedings, if any instituted in

Malaysia, would have to be transferred to a special court under Malaysian laws.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 It may be hindsight but it is not unreasonable for one to suppose that a

well-connected and well-informed businessman of the plaintiffs ilk would not have addressed

himself to the pitfalls and disadvantages of hitching himself with the royals before embarking

on a substantial venture such as the one under scrutiny. In my determination, the submission that

the plaintiffs would be overwhelmed in Malaysia, does not accord with the legal and legislative

frameworks in Malaysia where a citizen of Malaysia such as the plaintiff, can indeed bring

proceedings against the Rulers there (see <i><b>Faridah Begum bte Abdullah v Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah

Al Mustain Billah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar RiAyatuddin Al MuAdzam Shah</b></i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=42388&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 MLJ 617</a> at 622C-D). As to the backlog of cases in the courts of Malaysia, this factor alone in my

view cannot justify my favouring Singapore as the most appropriate forum. In any event, the

intention of the parties from the outset as can be gathered from the draft agreement adverted to,

appears to be that Malaysia is the most appropriate forum. The reason attempted by the plaintiff

that many foreign witnesses required for the trial favour Singapore to Malaysia is not

satisfactorily made out. In this regard, even Praptono himself appeared to have elected to commence

proceedings against the defendant in Malaysia, although the significance of those proceedings was

downplayed by his counsel as no more than a protective writ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 Having reviewed the evidence available, I am of the view that a conversation

held during a brief car ride from Seletar to Johor is hardly significant to justify the conclusion

that the oral agreement referred to was made in Singapore. On the other hand, the background facts

pleaded by the plaintiff warrant a conclusion to the contrary. In this regard para 15 of the

statement of claim points to the determination that whatever agreements entered into had their

source and origin at the office of the defendant in Malaysia. As to the location of witnesses, here

again as regards the services rendered by the plaintiff and the alleged promises made by the

defendant, the core evidence is to be adduced by the principal contestants. They are both resident

and located in Malaysia. The others, if required in my view, will not be too inconvenienced if the

hearing is held in Singapore or Malaysia. The reason offered by the plaintiff in para 21 of his

affidavit filed on 20 March 2001 that it would be more convenient for the witnesses to travel to

Singapore is not sufficiently weighty enough to disqualify an otherwise appropriate forum, which is

Malaysia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 Having regard to all the evidence placed before me and considered all the

learning referred to during the hearing of the registrars appeal as well as during further

arguments, I was satisfied that Malaysia has the closest connection to the issue at hand and is the

most appropriate forum. In the premises, I dismissed the plaintiffs appeal with costs and against

my order the plaintiff now appeals.<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4"></font></p>
