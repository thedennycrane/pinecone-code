        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the appellant, Yan Jun
                    (“the Appellant”), against the decision of the High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) in Registrar’s Appeal No 227 of 2013
                    (“RA 227/2013”). The Judge dismissed the Appellant’s
                    appeal against the decision of an assistant registrar (“the AR”)
                    in Summons No 2310 of 2013 (“SUM 2310/2013”) to strike
                    out parts of his statement of claim in Suit No 257 of 2013
                    (“S 257/2013”) under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                Rules”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts pleaded by the Appellant are as
                    follows. On the morning of 19 July 2009, the Appellant was in his flat in
                    Simei when he had an argument with his mother-in-law, Mdm Yu Xinlan
                    (“Mdm Yu”). Given previous instances of violence between
                    himself and Mdm Yu, the Appellant called the police. He then carried his
                    child into the master bedroom of the flat and waited for the police to
                    arrive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       During the time he was in the bedroom, the
                    Appellant heard Mdm Yu shouting to his wife, Mdm Liu Tian
                    (“Mdm Liu”), that certain stove accessories had been removed
                    from the kitchen. Upon hearing this, Mdm Liu rushed into the bedroom and
                    hit the Appellant repeatedly and violently. The Appellant held his child tightly
                    and raised his arm to protect himself, but did not fight back. He then ran out
                    of the bedroom with the child and stood in the dining room while Mdm Liu
                    remained in the bedroom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Shortly after this, two police officers arrived
                    at the flat. The Appellant pointed to the master bedroom and stated in Mandarin,
                    “she beat me”, but he was ignored by the police officers. Instead,
                    they went directly into the bedroom to speak to Mdm Liu. After some time,
                    they came out of the master bedroom and continued their conversation with
                    Mdm Liu in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant overheard Mdm Liu informing
                    the police officers that the Appellant had hit her deliberately because he knew
                    that an Expedited Order (“the EO”), which Mdm Liu had
                    obtained against him on 25 June 2009, was about to expire. The Appellant
                    also overheard one of the police officers talking to someone on the phone about
                    whether the EO was valid on that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After Mdm Liu had spoken to the police
                    officers, the Appellant told one of the police officers that it was his turn to
                    speak but was told that he was under arrest for breach of the EO. The Appellant
                    protested on the ground that the police officers had only heard one side of the
                    story but this was to no avail. The Appellant was handcuffed and later escorted
                    to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) for a medical
                    examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the treatment room at CGH, the Appellant was
                    asked by a doctor about how he had gotten injured, to which the Appellant
                    replied that he was beaten by his wife. The doctor then asked about the
                    Appellant’s wrongdoing to which one of the police officers answered
                    “breach of PPO [personal protection order]”. The Appellant alleges
                    that the doctor deliberately insulted him by replying “small
                    injury” in a loud voice. The Appellant’s medical report stated that
                    he had superficial nail excoriations on his face, neck and left
                hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mdm Liu also proceeded to CGH for a medical
                    examination. Her medical report stated that she had superficial abrasions and
                    tenderness on the left side of her neck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       After his medical examination, the Appellant was
                    taken to Bedok Police Division (“BPD”) for further investigations.
                    In the course of these investigations, the Appellant informed the Investigating
                    Officer (“the IO”) that he had gone to the Family Court on
                    6 July 2009, which was the return date of the EO, but that Mdm Liu had
                    not attended court on that day. The Appellant was released on bail from BPD the
                    next day, 20 July 2009, at about 6.30am. Approximately 21 hours had
                    elapsed from the time of the Appellant’s arrest to his
                release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After the Appellant was released, he went
                    again to the Family Court to check whether his wife had attended court on the
                    return date of the EO, and was informed that she had not. This suggested that
                    the EO was not valid when the Appellant was arrested on 19 July 2009.
                    Therefore, on the next day, the Appellant sent an SMS to the IO about
                    Mdm Liu’s non-attendance in court. He also later wrote to BPD for an
                    explanation and was told that the case had been passed on to one Staff Sergeant
                    Lim Shao Liang (“SSG Lim”). On 14 September 2009,
                    SSG Lim informed the Appellant that his case had been referred to the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”). Around this time, the
                    Appellant consulted a number of lawyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 5 October 2009, SSG Lim informed
                    the Appellant that, having consulted with the AGC, it had been decided that no
                    further action was to be taken against him. On 16 and 29 October 2009 the
                    Appellant sent emails to SSG Lim to question the validity of the EO and to
                    inquire about the outcome of the investigations. However, he did not receive a
                    reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Thereafter, the Appellant again consulted with
                    lawyers but took no further steps until 16 March 2012. On that day, he sent
                    an email to the AGC to ask about the outcome of the investigations. The AGC
                    replied on 4 and 5 June 2012, taking the position that, in the
                    circumstances of the case, there was a reasonable suspicion of the Appellant
                    being concerned with an offence of a breach of the EO, even though it was
                    subsequently discovered that the EO had been revoked by 19 July 2009. A
                    series of emails between the Appellant and the AGC then followed before the
                    Appellant filed S 257/2013 against the Attorney-General (“the
                    Respondent”) on 1 April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appellant’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In S 257/2013, the Appellant claims
                    damages against the Respondent for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment, assault
                    and battery, excessive use of force, malicious prosecution, abuse of process and
                    defamation. These causes of action arise generally from the circumstances
                    surrounding the Appellant’s arrest on 19 July 2009, and his
                    subsequent detention before he was released.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The cause of action in defamation, on the
                    other hand, is based on the statements allegedly made by the doctor and the
                    police officer at CGH during the Appellant’s medical examination (see
                    above at [7]). The Appellant states that he was defamed by the police officer
                    when the police officer had answered “breach of PPO” when asked by
                    the doctor about the Appellant’s wrongdoing. The Appellant also states
                    that the doctor had intentionally humiliated, and therefore defamed, him by
                    loudly announcing that the Appellant had suffered a “small
                    injury”.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 2 May 2013, the Respondent applied to
                    strike out the Appellant’s statement of claim on the ground that the
                    entire suit was time-barred. In the alternative, the Respondent submitted that
                    the statement of claim did not disclose reasonable causes of action. On
                    3 July 2013, the AR struck out all the Appellant’s claims except the
                    claim for general and aggravated damages for loss of liberty arising from false
                    imprisonment and the claim for punitive damages for false imprisonment. On
                    16 July 2013, the Appellant filed an appeal against the AR’s decision
                    in RA 227/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The appeal was heard, and dismissed, by the
                    Judge on 21 August 2013, with written grounds reported in <em>Yan Jun v Attorney-General</em> [2014] 1 SLR 793
                    (“the GD”). The Judge held (at [46]) that the Appellant’s
                        <em>entire suit</em> was time-barred under
                    ss 24A(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”). Despite this, the Judge appeared to be of the view
                    that the AR’s decision not to strike out the Appellant’s false
                    imprisonment claim should stand (at [54]). The Judge proceeded, by way of
                        <em>obiter dicta</em>, to hold that there were
                        <em>other grounds</em> for striking out the
                    Appellant’s causes of action in wrongful arrest, malicious prosecution,
                    abuse of process and defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The two broad issues before this court are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Appellant’s suit
                        is time-barred under s 24A of the Act
                        (“Issue 1”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether there are other grounds for striking out the
                        Appellant’s statement of claim
                    (“Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Turning first to the issue of whether the
                    Appellant’s suit is time-barred, the statutory provisions which are
                    germane to the present appeal are ss 6 and 24A of the Act. Section 6
                    of the Act (“s 6”) prescribes a <em>general</em> limitation period of six years for actions based on
                    contract or tort. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Limitation of actions of contract
                            and tort and certain other actions</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.—(1) <em>Subject to this Act</em>, the
                        following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) actions founded on a contract or on

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It should be noted that the six year
                    limitation period under s 6 is <em>subject to provision(s)
                        to the contrary</em> in the Act. In the context of the present appeal,
                    an example of this is to be found in s 24A of the Act which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                            date on which the plaintiff or any person in whom the cause of action
                            was vested before him first had both the knowledge required for bringing
                            an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage and a right to
                            bring such an action, if that period expires later than the period
                            mentioned in paragraph (<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Respondent takes the position that
                        <em>all</em> the causes of action pleaded by the
                    Appellant are actions for “breach of duty” under s 24A(1) of
                    the Act (“s 24A(1)”). It also contends that because the
                    damages claimed by the Appellant include damages in respect of personal injury,
                    a limitation period of three years applies to the <em>entire
                        suit</em> under s 24A(2) of the Act, with the effect that it is
                    time-barred. Conversely, the Appellant contends that s 24A(1) has no
                    application because his pleaded causes of action fall outside the meaning of
                    “breach of duty”. He therefore states that a limitation period of
                    six years under s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act applies
                    instead. Before considering these arguments in greater detail, let us first
                    consider the legislative history of s 24A(1) itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legislative history of s 24A(1) in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 24A(1), in its present
                    incarnation, was the product of amendments to the Act in 1966 and 1992,
                    respectively. Prior to 1966, the Limitation Ordinance 1959 (Ordinance 57 of
                    1959) provided for a general six year limitation period for all torts,
                    notwithstanding the nature of the cause of action pleaded or the damages sought.
                    This state of affairs was altered by the Limitation (Amendment) Act (Act 7
                    of 1966) (“the 1966 amendments”) which introduced a new
                    s 6(3A) in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3A) An action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty
                        (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of provision made or
                        under any written law or independently of any contract or any such
                        provision) where the damages claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence,
                        nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in respect of
                        personal injuries to any person, shall not be brought after the expiration
                        of three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The 1966 amendments therefore had the effect
                    of reducing the limitation period from six to three years where damages were
                    claimed in respect of personal injury in actions for negligence, nuisance or
                    breach of duty. The rationale for these amendments was explained by the then
                    Minister for Law and National Development, Mr Yong Nyuk Lin
                    (“Mr Yong”), in the Second Reading Speech (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (21 April 1966) vol 25 at col 79), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill seeks to amend the Limitation Ordinance, 1959, to reduce the
                        period of limitation for damages for personal injuries from six years to
                        three years. <em>This will bring the law in line with the law
                            in England where the period of limitation was fixed at three
                            years</em> by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act,
                        1954.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>effect of the amendment will be that in general
                            actions for personal injuries, arising, for example, from motor-car
                            accidents, may only be brought within three years of the
                            accident</em>. It is desirable that such actions should be heard
                        as soon as possible after the accident, as, if the action is instituted,
                        say, after four or five years, it would be difficult for witnesses to
                        testify about the accident with any degree of accuracy. The Act will
                        therefore prevent the institution of stale proceedings. Police investigation
                        papers are normally destroyed by the Police two or three years after an
                        accident and if actions are brought after that, police witnesses will be
                        unable to refresh their memories from statements or plans made by them soon
                        after the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is felt that the reduction of the limitation period to three years
                        would cause no hardship to third parties. Injuries caused by motor accidents
                        normally become obvious immediately after the accident and the wide
                        publicity given to proceedings relating to accidents in the local Press and
                        the availability of lawyers make it possible for any third party to take
                        advice and action within a reasonably short time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Act was amended again in 1992, by way of
                    the Limitation (Amendment) Act (Act 22 of 1992) (“the 1992
                    amendments”). The 1992 amendments introduced, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the present s 24A. In 1992, Parliament had intended to
                    address the perceived injustice created by the then existing limitation periods
                    where the damage suffered by the plaintiff was <em>latent</em> and not readily discoverable. As the then Minister for
                    Law, Prof S Jayakumar (“Prof Jayakumar”) explained
                    during the Second Reading of the bill (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (29 May 1992)
                    vol 60 at cols 31–32)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, under the existing law, the limitation periods are as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(1) In the case of personal injury, it is three years from the date
                            the damage occurred; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(2) In non-personal injury cases, it is six years from the date the
                            damage occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This amendment is necessary because under the present law, the limitation
                        period for legal actions runs from the time the damage actually occurred
                        even if the plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known about
                        the damage. This can, of course, cause injustice and problems, especially in
                        building construction cases where latent defects may not be discoverable
                        until after the limitation period has expired. In such cases, the plaintiff,
                        or the aggrieved party, is then left without any legal recourse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Sir, the Bill before us amends the Limitation Act along
                            the lines of the United Kingdom Limitation Act 1980 and the United
                            Kingdom Latent Damage Act 1986. What it does is to extend the limitation
                            periods for personal and non-personal injury claims by providing an
                            alternative starting date for the limitation period, ie, the date the
                            aggrieved person has knowledge of the damage. The limitation period
                            would be computed from the date that expires later.</em> It also
                        seeks to balance the interest of potential defendants by providing that no
                        action may be brought after 15 years from the date of the breach of
                        duty even though the damage or injury has not and could not be
                        discovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It will be evident that the parliamentary
                    material, <em>when read alone</em>, sheds little light on
                    what is meant by the phrase “breach of duty” under s 24A(1).
                    In particular, it is unclear whether the phrase ought to be read widely, as
                    including <em>all</em> torts and breaches of contract. This
                    difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that there has been a <em>dearth</em> of authority where the phrase has received judicial
                    interpretation by the Singapore courts. It should be noted, however, that there
                    is, and has been, considerable identification between the Singapore limitation
                    statutes and the English ones. In this regard, both the 1966 and 1992 amendments
                    were intended by Parliament to update the Singapore position in the light of
                    common law and statutory developments in England. Let us therefore now consider
                    what these developments were.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Developments in the English law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Prior to 1954, s 2 of the Limitation Act
                    1939 (c 21) (UK) (“the 1939 UK Act”) provided for a general
                    limitation period of six years for actions founded on contract and tort. If,
                    however, the defendant was a public authority, then s 21 of the 1939 UK
                    Act, read with s 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893
                    (c 61) (UK) (“PAPA”), applied and the limitation period was
                    one year instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In 1944, a committee chaired by
                    Sir Walter Monckton (“the Monckton Committee”) recommended
                    that the limitation period should be three years for actions for personal
                    injuries, whether the defendant was a public authority or not (see <em>The Final Report of the Departmental Committee on Alternative
                        Remedies</em> (Cmd 6860) at paras 107–108). In the
                    Monckton Committee’s view, the general limitation period of six years was
                    too long a period of delay before commencing an action while the limitation
                    period of one year for public authorities was too short.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In January 1948, a committee chaired by
                    Lord Justice Tucker (“the Tucker Committee”) was
                    constituted to further consider reforming the said Acts. Their terms of
                    reference included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) whether the [PAPA], as amended in its application to England and Wales
                        by s 21 of the [the 1939 UK Act]…, should be further amended or
                        repealed;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) whether any alteration should be made in the time limits prescribed by
                        [s 2 of the 1939 UK Act], for the bringing of certain actions in
                        England and Wales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The findings and recommendations of the Tucker
                    Committee were published on 30 July 1949 in the <em>Report
                        of the Committee on the Limitation of Actions</em> (Cmd 7740)
                    (“the Tucker Report”). Three of the Tucker Committee’s
                    recommendations are of note. First, it recommended the repeal of the PAPA, so
                    that the limitation period which applied to private litigants would similarly
                    apply to the Crown. Secondly, it recommended that the general limitation for
                    actions in contract and tort remain at six years. Thirdly, <em>and most pertinently for the purpose of the present proceedings</em>,
                    it recommended that the limitation period for actions for personal injuries be
                    reduced to two years. In this regard, the Tucker Committee opined as follows
                    (see the Tucker Report at paras 22–23):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    We do, however, recommend a change in the period of
                            limitation for actions for personal injuries. These, whether founded on
                            contract or tort, ought generally to be brought within two years of the
                            accrual of the cause of action, having regard to the desirability of
                            such actions being brought to trial quickly, whilst evidence is fresh in
                            the minds of the parties and witnesses …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    We consider that the period of limitation we have
                            recommended should apply to all actions for personal injuries, whether
                            the defendant is a public authority or not. We do not think it is
                            necessary for us to define “personal injuries”, although
                            this may possibly be necessary if legislative effect is given to our
                            recommendations. <b><em>We wish, however, to make it clear
                                that we do not include in that category actions for trespass to the
                                person, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, or defamation of
                                character, but we do include such actions as claims for negligence
                                against doctors.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Tucker Committee, however, did not elaborate as to why
                        these torts should not be subject to the shorter limitation period it had
                        recommended for actions for personal injuries more
                generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the basis of the recommendations of the
                    Tucker Committee, the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc) Act 1954
                    (c 36) (UK) (“the 1954 UK Act”) was enacted. The material
                    portions of the new s 2(1) read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that, in the case of <em>actions for damages for

                        damages claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence, nuisance or breach of
                        duty consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to any
                        person, this subsection shall have effect as if for the reference to six

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At the second reading of the amendment Bill,
                    the proposer of the Bill, Mr John Peyton explained the nature of the
                    amendments in the following terms (see <em>Parliamentary Debates
                        (Hansard) – House of Commons</em> (4 December 1953)

                            one comparatively minor point</em> upon which the provisions vary

                        provisions of the Bill, be brought within three years, with very minor
                        exceptions, regardless of who the defendant is …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This “minor point” was to substitute a
                        limitation period of three years – which was recommended by the
                        Monckton Committee – for the two recommended by the Tucker Report in
                        actions for personal injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Yet, none of the speeches in the House of
                    Commons and the House of Lords expressly referred to the Tucker
                    Committee’s recommendation that the shorter limitation period for personal
                    injury claims should <em>not</em> apply to actions for
                    trespass to the person, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and
                    defamation. Rather, <em>some speeches appeared to assume that the
                        shorter limitation period was to apply to all actions for personal injuries,
                        notwithstanding the precise cause of action that was pleaded</em>. For
                    example, Mr Graham Page, member for Crosby, observed in the House of
                    Commons as follows (see <em>Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second main object of the Bill is to reduce from six years to three

                            to differ in its technical nature</em>, but it is a practical
                        measure which has the support of the Tucker and the Monckton Committees and
                        is, in fact, probably a condition of achieving the object of extending the
                        period of limitation for public authorities. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 2(1) of the 1954 UK Act arose for
                    interpretation by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Letang v
                        Cooper</em> [1965] 1 QB 232 (“<em>Letang</em>”). The plaintiff there was injured when the
                    defendant drove over her legs while she was sunbathing in a carpark. She sued in
                    negligence and trespass to the person but only issued the writ four years after
                    the accident. The trial judge held that the defendant was negligent on the basis
                    of an unintentional trespass to the plaintiff’s person. He also
                    interpreted the phrase “breach of duty” under s 2(1) of the
                    1954 UK Act as not including an action for trespass to the person. In the event,
                    the relevant limitation period was held to be six years and the
                    plaintiff’s action was therefore not time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Court of Appeal allowed the
                    defendant’s appeal. Lord Denning MR held (at 240) that as the
                    injury was not inflicted by the defendant intentionally, the plaintiff’s
                    only cause of action lay in negligence and not trespass to the person. This
                    cause of action was clearly time-barred under s 2(1) of the 1954 UK Act.
                    Pertinently, however, Lord Denning went on to observe that, <em>even if the plaintiff did have a cause of action in trespass to the
                        person, it too would have been time-barred as it was an action for
                        “breach of duty”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Lord Denning gave several reasons for
                    construing the phrase “breach of duty” in this manner. He noted at
                    the outset that the Tucker Report had recommended excluding the torts of
                    trespass to the person, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and defamation
                    from the ambit of the shorter limitation period. However, he was of the view
                    that this did not militate in favour of reading the phrase “breach of
                    duty” as not including these torts. Lord Denning explained thus (at
                    240–241):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think the text-writers have been in error in being influenced by the
                        recommendations of the [Tucker Committee] … You must interpret the
                        words of Parliament as they stand, without too much regard to the
                        recommendations of the committee … In this very case, Parliament did
                        not reduce the period to two years. It made it three years. It did not make
                        any exception of “trespass to the person” or the rest.
                            <em>It used words of general import; and it is those
                            words which we have to construe, without reference to the
                            recommendations of the Committee</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In Lord Denning’s view, the phrase
                    “breach of duty” was wide enough to encompass all torts. He
                    reasoned, in this regard, that (at 241):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Our whole law of tort today proceeds on the footing
                            that there is a duty owed by every man not to injure his neighbour in a
                            way that is forbidden by law</em>. Negligence is a breach of such
                        a duty. So is nuisance. So is trespass to the person. So is false
                        imprisonment, malicious prosecution or defamation of character. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Finally, Lord Denning noted (at 241) that
                    the phrase “breach of duty” had been given a similarly wide
                    construction by Lord Greene MR in the English Court of Appeal decision
                    of <em>Billings v Reed</em> [1945] KB 11 (“<em>Billings</em>”) and by Adam J in the Victoria
                    decision of <em>Kruber v Grzesiak</em> [1963] 2 VR
                    621. The latter of the cases just mentioned concerned the interpretation of the
                    Victorian limitation legislation which was in identical terms to s 2(1) of
                    the English Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Between the time the 1954 UK Act was passed
                    and <em>Letang</em> was decided, the English legislation
                    was amended again by way of the Limitation Act 1963 (c 47) (UK)
                    (“the 1963 UK Act”). These amendments were intended to ameliorate
                    the harshness of the effect of the House of Lords decision in <em>Cartledge v E Jopling &amp; Sons Ltd</em> [1963] AC
                    758 (“<em>Cartledge</em>”). In <em>Cartledge</em>, the plaintiff steel workers had been exposed
                    to silica dust for periods between 1939 to 1950. By 1950, at the latest, each of
                    the plaintiffs had contracted pneumoconiosis but this was not diagnosed until
                    sometime between 1950 and 1955. The plaintiffs commenced their action in
                    1956.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The court in <em>Cartledge</em> held that the plaintiffs’ causes of action
                    accrued when more than negligible damage occurred, even though the injury was
                    unknown to, and could not be discovered by, the plaintiffs. Hence, the
                    plaintiffs’ actions were time-barred, the six year limitation period
                    having expired in 1950 by the latest. At the same time, all the judgments
                    delivered by the court expressed concern about the harshness of the decision
                    which they felt compelled to arrive at under the 1939 UK Act and called for
                    legislative reform in that regard. Further, as Lord Pearce noted (at 777),
                    the situation was exacerbated by the 1954 UK Act which (it will be recalled) had
                    reduced the limitation period in personal injury cases to three
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The 1963 UK Act was enacted shortly after the
                    decision in <em>Cartledge</em>. Section 1 of the Act
                    permitted the extension of the limitation period in cases of <em>latent damage</em>, provided the following requirements set out in
                    the section were met:</p>

                            end of that period, and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in either case, was a date not earlier than twelve months

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The 1963 UK Act therefore provided for an <em>alternative</em> limitation period of one year that ran from the
                        date the plaintiff came to know of the facts giving rise to his cause of
                        action for personal injury, in cases where the injury he suffered was
                        latent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The 1963 UK Act was further amended in 1971
                    and 1975 <em>vide</em> the Law Reform (Miscellaneous
                    Provisions) Act 1971 (c 43) (UK) and the Limitation Act 1975 (c 54)
                    (UK) (“the 1975 UK Act”), respectively. In summary, these
                    amendments had the effect of, respectively, extending the alternative limitation
                    period from one year to three in cases of latent damage and clarifying the
                    concept of the knowledge required by the plaintiff to commence his
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In 1980, the English Parliament sought to
                    consolidate all the interim legislation passed since 1939 by enacting the
                    Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) (“the 1980 UK Act”).
                    Section 11 of the 1980 UK Act is the most germane in the context of the
                    present proceedings and it reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>11  Special time limit
                            for actions in respect of personal injuries</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) This section applies to any action for damages for negligence,
                        nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract
                        or of provision made by or under a statute or independently of any contract
                        or any such provision) where the damages claimed by the plaintiff for the
                        negligence, nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in
                        respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the date of knowledge (if later) of the person
                            injured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is also pertinent to note that s 33 of
                    the 1980 UK Act confers upon the court discretion to extend the limitation
                    period in cases where s 11 applies. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) If it appears to the court that it would be equitable to allow an
                        action to proceed having regard to the degree to which –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the provisions of section 11 … of this Act prejudice

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) any decision of the court under this subsection would prejudice

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the court may direct that those provisions shall not apply to the action,
                        or shall not apply to any specified cause of action to which the action
                        relates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The new s 11 arose for interpretation by
                    the House of Lords in <em>Stubbings v Webb</em> [1993] AC
                    498 (“<em>Stubbings</em>”). The plaintiff in
                        <em>Stubbings</em> was the victim of sexual abuse by
                    her stepfather and stepbrother during her childhood. She suffered psychological
                    disorders and mental illness as a result. Although the plaintiff had attained
                    the age of the majority in 1975, her writ was only issued in 1987. She
                    attributed this delay to the fact that she had only come to realise that the
                    abuse was causative of her injuries after consulting with a psychiatrist in
                    September 1984. The issue, therefore, was whether the plaintiff’s action
                    for deliberate assault was an action for “breach of duty”. If it
                    was, then the limitation period would have been three years from the date she
                    realised that her injuries were significant and attributable to the
                    defendants’ acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Stubbings</em>,
                    the House <em>unanimously declined</em> to follow the
                    interpretation of the words “breach of duty” advanced in <em>Letang</em> and held that the plaintiff’s claim based
                    on assault did <em>not</em> fall within the meaning of
                    “breach of duty”. Rather, the phrase was construed to mean
                        <em>breach of a duty of care</em>. It followed that a
                    non-extendable limitation period of six years from the date the
                    plaintiff’s cause of action accrued applied and her claims were
                    accordingly time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In arriving at this conclusion,
                    Lord Griffiths, with whom the other members of the court agreed, placed
                    much reliance on the recommendations made by the Tucker Committee, noting (at
                    507) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But I cannot agree that the words “breach of duty” have the
                        effect of including within the scope of the section all actions in which
                        damages for personal injuries are claimed which is the other ground upon
                        which the Court of Appeal decided <em>Letang v.
                            Cooper</em>. If that had been the intention of the draftsman it
                        would have been easy enough to say so in the section. <em>On
                            the contrary the draftsman has used words of limitation; he has limited
                            the section to actions for negligence, nuisance and breach of duty and
                            the reason he did so was to give effect to the recommendation of the
                            Tucker Committee that the three-year period should not apply to a number
                            of causes of action in which damages for personal injury might be
                            claimed namely damages for trespass to the person, false imprisonment,
                            malicious prosecution or defamation.</em> There can be no doubt
                        that rape and indecent assault fell within the category of trespass to the
                        person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Denning M.R. in <em>Letang v.
                            Cooper</em> [1965] 1 Q.B. 232, 240 was not prepared to assume
                        that Parliament did intend to give effect to the Tucker Committee’s
                        recommendations, but we can now look at Hansard and can see that it was the
                        express intention of Parliament to do so…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In so far as Lord Griffith purported to rely on the UK
                            <em>Hansard</em>, he referred to that part of
                        Mr John Peyton’s speech in the House of Commons, which we set out
                        above at [31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Lord Griffiths went on to express doubt
                    as to whether the phrase “breach of duty” could properly bear the
                    meaning attributed to it by the Court of Appeal in <em>Letang</em>. He stated as follows (at 508):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even without reference to Hansard I should not myself have construed
                        breach of duty as including a deliberate assault. The phrase lying in
                        juxtaposition with negligence and nuisance carries with it the implication
                        of a breach of duty of care not to cause personal injury, rather than an
                        obligation not to infringe any legal right of another person. If I invite a
                        lady to my house one would naturally think of a duty to take care that the
                        house is safe but would one really be thinking of a duty not to rape her?
                        But, however this may be, the terms in which this Bill was introduced to my
                        mind make it clear beyond peradventure that the intention was to give effect
                        to the Tucker recommendation that the limitation period in respect of
                        trespass to the person was not to be reduced to three years but should
                        remain at six years. The language of section 2(1) of the Act of 1954 is
                        in my view apt to give effect to that intention, and cases of deliberate
                        assault such as we are concerned with in this case are not actions for
                        breach of duty within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Act of
                        1954.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Lord Griffiths also did not think that by
                    passing the 1975 UK Act and the 1980 UK Act in the same language, Parliament had
                    endorsed the interpretation accorded to the phrase “breach of
                    duty” in <em>Letang</em>. He noted that the 1963 UK
                    Act, which had preceded <em>Letang</em>, was intended to
                    address the problem posed by the insidious onset of industrial disease, which
                    arose in <em>Cartledge</em>. The 1975 UK Act was passed to
                    cure the imperfections of the 1963 UK Act and the 1980 UK Act merely re-enacted
                    that part of the 1975 UK Act. In the final analysis, Lord Griffiths held
                    that as the language of the 1954 UK Act was carried without alteration into the
                    1975 UK Act, and then into s 11(1) of the 1980 UK Act, it should bear the
                    same meaning as it had under the 1954 UK Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>A v Hoare</em>
                    [2008] 1 AC 844 (“<em>Hoare</em>”), the
                    House of Lords had the opportunity to revisit its decision in <em>Stubbings</em>. Having done so, the House unanimously decided to
                        <em>depart</em> from it. The plaintiff in <em>Hoare</em> was the victim of an attempted rape by the
                    defendant in 1998. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to life
                    imprisonment. The plaintiff, however, did not commence an action until December
                    of 2004. In fact, she had only done so after the defendant had won
                    £7,000,000 in a lottery, thus making him a party worth suing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Hoare</em>,
                    Lord Hoffmann, who delivered the leading judgment, <em>cautioned</em> against placing <em>undue
                        reliance</em> on <em>the recommendations of the Tucker
                        Committee</em> in construing the phrase “breach of
                    duty”. He first noted (at [4] and [6]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are minor puzzles about why malicious prosecution or defamation of
                        character were thought capable of causing personal injury or why doctors
                        were singled out for mention, but the committee certainly seems to have
                        intended to exclude actions for trespass to the person from their proposal.
                        They did not explain why. The reason they gave for adopting a short period
                        for personal injury claims (“the desirability of such actions being
                        brought to trial quickly, whilst evidence is fresh in the minds of the
                        parties and witnesses”: para 22) would seem equally applicable
                        to cases in which the cause of action is trespass. Perhaps they had in mind
                        only intentionally inflicted injuries and thought that a defendant who
                        caused deliberate injury should not have the benefit of a short limitation
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will be seen that in defining the actions to which the three-year
                        period was to apply, Parliament adopted neither the simple concept of an
                        action for personal injury (for which, as the committee had suggested, the
                        Act provided a definition) nor the specific exclusions mentioned by the
                        Tucker Committee, but spoke of “actions for damages for negligence,
                        nuisance or breach of duty … where the damages claimed …
                        consist of or include damages in respect of personal
                        injuries”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In this regard, Lord Hoffmann observed that the language
                        used by the UK Parliament was not new (at [7]). Rather, it had previously
                        been judicially interpreted in <em>Billings</em> as
                        having a <em>wide meaning</em> which included the tort
                        of trespass to the person (at [8]–[9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Lord Hoffmann also found support for a
                    wide interpretation of the phrase “breach of duty” from the
                    legislative amendments in 1975 and 1980. He explained thus (at [14] and
                    [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…<em>When the 1954 Act was passed, it could have
                            been argued that the exclusion of intentionally inflicted injuries
                            reflected a moral policy of denying the shorter limitation period to an
                            intentional wrongdoer.</em> Such an argument did not find favour
                        in <em>Kruber v Grzesiak</em> [1963] VR 621 or
                            <em>Letang v Cooper</em> [1965] 1 QB 232, but
                        I should have thought that, given the terms of the Tucker Committee Report
                        and the obscurity of the parliamentary language, it was seriously arguable.
                        But there could be <em>no moral or other ground for denying
                            to a victim of intentional injury the more favourable limitation
                            treatment introduced by the 1975 Act for victims of injuries caused by
                            negligence</em>. The inference I would draw is that in using the
                        same form of words in the 1975 Act, Parliament must have intended them to
                        bear the meaning which they had been given in the uniform line of authority
                        in England and Australia to which I have referred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a further indication to the same effect in the 20th Report of the
                        Law Reform Committee on Limitation of Actions (Cmnd 5630) which was
                        published in May 1974 and to which the 1975 Act gave effect. It is plain
                        from that report that its members thought they were dealing generally with
                        personal injury actions: see, for example, the summary of recommendations in
                        para 69. There is no discussion of an exclusion of intentionally
                        inflicted injuries from the benefit of the proposed reforms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>To this end, Lord Hoffmann criticised <em>Stubbings</em> as having been decided as if the 1954 UK Act had
                        just been enacted (at [17]). Lord Hoffmann disagreed with
                        Lord Griffiths’s characterisation of the 1963 and 1975 amendments
                        as being to “meet the problem of the insidious onset of industrial
                        disease” (see <em>Stubbings</em> at 506). He
                        opined, instead, that the amendments were intended to apply to cases of
                        personal injuries more generally (at [18]–[19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meaning of “breach of duty” under s 24A of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     With the foregoing as background, let us turn
                    to consider the meaning of the phrase “breach of duty” under
                    s 24A(1). In this regard, the Judge followed <em>Letang</em> and held that the phrase was wide enough to encompass all
                    torts, and, therefore, all the causes of action pleaded by the Appellant. The
                    Judge also noted that <em>Letang</em> had been approved by
                    the House of Lords in <em>Hoare</em>.</p>

                    contends that the Judge’s interpretation of the phrase was incorrect
                    because the Tucker Committee had excluded the torts of trespass to the person,
                    malicious prosecution, false imprisonment and defamation from the shorter
                    limitation period they had recommended for personal injury actions. Presumably,
                    what the Appellant means is that this would entail this court reading the phrase
                    “breach of duty” under s 24A(1) as not including these
                    torts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In this regard, the Appellant’s
                    contention is a <em>superficially</em> attractive one. On a
                    broad level at least, the 1954 UK Act, which introduced the phrase
                    “breach of duty”, was passed on the back of the Tucker Report
                    which had recommended excluding these torts from the shorter limitation period
                    they had recommended for personal injury actions. Furthermore, by <em>specifically including</em> the words
                    “negligence” and “nuisance” before the phrase, it is
                    at least arguable that the UK Parliament, and <em>a
                        fortiori</em> the Singapore Parliament, could not have intended
                    “breach of duty” to refer to all torts. Otherwise, the words
                    “negligence” and “nuisance” would be rendered
                        <em>superfluous</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On the <em>other
                        hand</em>, there are considerable difficulties with the foregoing
                    view, which suggest that the Appellant’s reliance on the Tucker Report is
                        <em>misplaced</em>. For a start, as Lord Hoffmann
                    pointed out in <em>Hoare</em>, the UK Parliament’s
                    use of the phrase “breach of duty” was not traceable to anything
                    that was stated in the Tucker Report. Rather, as noted above at [32], the
                    speeches in the English parliamentary debates seem to suggest that the three
                    year limitation period was intended to apply to actions for damages for personal
                    injuries more generally, without stating the causes of action to which this was,
                    or was not, to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     More pertinently, perhaps, the issue before
                    this court is <em>not</em> the interpretation of the
                    English limitation legislation in 1954, <em>but the
                        interpretation of s 24A(1) as enacted by the Singapore Parliament in
                        1966 and as subsequently amended in 1992</em>. Counsel for the
                    Respondent, Mr Khoo Boo Jin (“Mr Khoo”), submits that,
                    when the Singapore Parliament passed the 1966 amendments, it did so against the
                    backdrop of the interpretation given to the phrase “breach of
                    duty” in <em>Letang</em>. By retaining the phrase,
                    Mr Khoo argues that the Singapore Parliament must have intended to endorse
                    that interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In our judgment, there is force in
                    Mr Khoo’s submission. In this regard, it is a canon of statutory
                    interpretation that where the legislature re-enacts a statute in words that have
                    received interpretation by a superior court, it intends those words to bear the
                    meaning which the court has given to them (see, for example, the English Court
                    of Appeal in Chancery decision of <em>Ex Parte Campbell. In re
                        Cathcart</em> (1870) LR 5 Ch 703 at 706). This canon <em>also</em> applies where the provisions under consideration
                    have been construed by a competent court in a <em>foreign
                        jurisdiction</em> (see, for example, the High Court of Australia
                    decision of <em>National Phonograph Co of Australia Ltd v
                        Menck</em> (1908) 7 CLR 481 at 529).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Yet, to the extent that this canon is premised
                    on the <em>legal fiction</em> that the legislature is
                    presumed to scrutinise all judicial decisions, it <em>must
                        be</em> applied with <em>the requisite
                        circumspection</em>. Moreover, it <em>must yield to
                        actual legislative intent to the contrary</em> under the <em>purposive approach</em> that is <em>mandated</em> by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                    2002 Rev Ed). As V K Rajah JA observed in the Singapore High
                    Court decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act requires the construction of
                        written law to promote the purpose or object underlying the statute. In
                        fact, it <em>mandates</em> that a construction
                        promoting legislative purpose be preferred over one that does not promote
                        such purpose or object: see Brady Coleman, “The Effect of
                        Section 9A of the Interpretation Act on Statutory Interpretation in
                        Singapore” [2000] Sing JLS 152 at 154. <b><em>Accordingly, any common law principle of interpretation, such as the
                            plain meaning rule and the strict construction rule, must yield to the

                            even after an attempt at purposive interpretation has been properly
                            made.</em></b> [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Bearing Rajah JA’s observations in
                    mind, we are of the view that the canon referred to above at [57] <em>can</em> be properly applied in the case before us. As we
                    have already noted above at [23], it was Parliament’s intention in passing
                    the 1966 amendments to align the law in Singapore with that in England.
                    Furthermore, the then Minister for Law and National Development, Mr Yong,
                    explained that the thrust of the amendments was to shorten the limitation period
                    to three years in “general actions for personal injuries”, without
                    drawing a distinction between different causes of action. Although the Minister
                    referred to motor-accident cases, it is evident that he did so by way of
                    illustration only. The foregoing analysis coheres with the wide interpretation
                    given to the phrase “breach of duty” in <em>Letang</em>. However, it is acknowledged that an argument could be
                    made to the effect that the Singapore Parliament might not possibly have been
                    aware of <em>Letang</em>. That having been said, this is
                    unlikely to have been the case. The decision itself was handed down on
                    15 June <em>1964</em>, and was reported in [1964]
                    3 WLR 573 (later in the Official Law Reports (Queen’s Bench Series)
                    as noted above (at [33])). It was also noted contemporaneously in at least two
                    leading journals by two very distinguished authors (see J A Jolowicz,
                    “Forms of Action – Causes of Action – Trespass and
                    Negligence” [1964] CLJ 200 and Gerald Dworkin, “Trespass and
                    Negligence – A Further Attempt to Bury the Forms of Action” (1965)
                    28 MLR 92). Be that as it may, it could not have been the case that, by the
                    time the <em>1992</em> amendments were enacted, the
                    Singapore Parliament was not aware of the decision in (as well as legal
                    implications of) <em>Letang</em>. And it is to these
                    last-mentioned amendments that our attention must now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As just mentioned, the <em>1992</em> amendments in the <em>Singapore</em>
                    context are also apposite in this regard. As noted earlier, the 1992 amendments
                    were directed at the problem of latent damage and they followed a line of
                    legislative and common law developments in England. At the Second Reading stage,
                    Prof Jayakumar made express reference to these common law developments. By
                    1992, therefore, it is inconceivable that Parliament was unaware of the
                    interpretation accorded to the phrase “breach of duty” by
                        <em>Letang</em>. Moreover, in cases of latent damage,
                    we do not, <em>as a matter of policy</em>, see why a
                    different limitation period should apply based on whether or not the damage was
                    caused by an intentional or unintentional tort, or, for that matter, a breach of
                    contract. Cases such as <em>Stubbings</em> and <em>Hoare</em> demonstrate that latent damage is just as much an
                    issue in the case of intentional torts. Indeed, in explaining the effect of the
                    1992 amendments, Prof Jayakumar did not distinguish between different
                    causes of action. Instead, he spoke in <em>general
                        terms</em> and distinguished between personal injury and non-personal
                    injury cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In our judgment, a <em>purposive interpretation</em> of s 24A(1) would entail reading
                    the phrase “breach of duty” as <em>encompassing all
                        torts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Appellant’s second argument was that
                    the tort of false imprisonment is a strict liability tort and therefore not
                    based on any “breach of duty”. In our judgment, this argument is
                    untenable. We agree with the Judge’s observation (see the GD at [40]) that
                    there is <em>no dichotomy between torts of strict and fault-based
                        liability under s 24A</em>. It is, first and foremost, plain from
                    the language of s 24A(1) that it applies to breaches of contractual duties,
                    in which case liability would be strict. There is also <em>nothing</em> in the both the English and local legislative history
                    which suggests that Parliament had intended for such a dichotomy to exist.
                    Instead, as we have already explained, it is more likely that Parliament had
                    intended that the phrase “breach of duty” to be read <em>widely</em>, and therefore encompassing <em>all torts and breaches of contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Appellant’s final argument was that
                    his causes of actions in tort do not concern a “breach of duty” as
                    the police officers did not owe him any duty when arresting him. With respect,
                    this argument is flawed for the simple reason that <em>if the
                        police officers did not owe the Appellant any duty at all, the Appellant
                        would not have had a cause of action against the Respondent in tort in the
                        first place</em>. As Lord Denning observed in <em>Letang</em> (at 241), “[o]ur whole law of tort today proceeds
                    on the footing that there is a duty owed by every man not to injure his
                    neighbour in a way forbidden by law”. The fact that the police officers
                    had committed the alleged torts in the proper discharge of a public duty would
                    only be relevant to the issue of whether they had <em>breached</em> the duties which they owed to the Appellant and
                        <em>not</em> to the issue of whether the action is one
                    for a “breach of duty”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the circumstances, we find that each of the
                    causes of action pleaded by the Appellant were in respect of a “breach of
                    duty” under s 24A(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Do the damages claimed by the Appellant consist of or include damages
                in respect of personal injuries?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Having found that each of the causes of action
                    pleaded by the Appellant were in respect of a breach of duty, the Judge held
                    that because the Appellant’s <em>suit included a claim for
                        damages for personal injuries, a limitation period of three years applied to
                        the entire suit</em> under s 24A(2) of the Act
                    (“s 24A(2)”) (see the GD at [43]–[46]). To
                    recapitulate, s 24A(2) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)  <em>An action to which this
                            section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages
                            in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other
                            person</em>, shall not be brought after the expiration of
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) 3 years from the date on
                            which the cause of action accrued; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) 3 years from the earliest
                            date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an
                            action for damages in respect of the relevant injury, if that period
                            expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In this regard, the Judge cited the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Bennett v Greenland
                        Houchen &amp; Co (A Firm)</em> [1998] PNLR 458
                        (“<em>Bennett</em>”) as authority for his
                    interpretation of s 24A(2). In <em>Bennett</em>, the
                    plaintiff sued his previous solicitors for breach of contract and negligence for
                    mishandling earlier litigation. He claimed damages for clinical depression, as
                    well as for financial loss, because his employability had become impaired as a
                    result of his depression. Pertinently, however, the suit was commenced after the
                    three year limitation period for personal injuries actions under s 11 of
                    the 1980 UK Act had expired. To avoid the problem of limitation posed in this
                    last-mentioned regard, the plaintiff argued that his claim was really one for
                    economic loss and that the claim for damages for clinical depression was
                    peripheral to this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This argument was not accepted by the court
                    which held that, because the plaintiff’s action included a claim for
                    damages for personal injury, a limitation period of three years applied and the
                    entire action was time-barred. Both Otton and Peter Gibson LJJ reasoned
                    that the width of the language used under s 11 of the 1980 UK Act meant
                    that the section applied not only when the damages claimed <em>consisted of</em> damages for personal injury, but also when they
                        <em>included</em> such damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     To this end, <em>Bennett</em> purported to follow a line of authority previously
                    established in <em>Howe v David Brown Tractors (Retail)
                        Ltd</em> [1991] 4 All ER 30 (“<em>Howe</em>”) and <em>Walkin v South Manchester
                        Health Authority</em> [1995] 1 WLR 1543 (“<em>Walkin</em>”). In <em>Howe</em>,
                    the plaintiff was a farmer and was in partnership with his father. He was
                    subsequently injured while operating machinery supplied by the defendant. His
                    writ was filed outside the three year limitation period and a defence based on
                    limitation was raised by the defendant. The plaintiff then applied to join his
                    father or the partnership as a co-plaintiff. To avoid the shorter limitation
                    period for personal injuries actions, the partnership framed its claim as one
                    for economic loss, being the additional cost of buying an automatic car and a
                    modified tractor for the plaintiff’s use, the cost of additional crop
                    irrigation equipment, the cost of engaging contractors to carry out
                    crop-spraying when the plaintiff was unable to do so, and loss of
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    partnership’s claim was for damages in respect of personal injury and was
                    therefore also time-barred. In coming to this conclusion, Stuart-Smith LJ
                    reasoned thus (at 36):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If one asks the question: ‘What is the firm’s action all
                        about?’ the answer is that it is a claim for damages consisting of
                        loss of profit caused by breach of contract or negligence on the part of the
                        defendant, resulting from the personal injury to the plaintiff … It
                        is the supply of a dangerous machine which constitutes the breach of duty in
                        tort to the plaintiff and causes his personal injury and pecuniary loss
                        resulting from such injury. It is the supply of the dangerous machine which
                        constitutes the breach of contractual duty owed to the firm to supply a
                        machine of merchantable quality and fit for its purpose; this breach of duty
                        only causes financial loss to the firm because of the loss resulting from
                        the personal injury to the plaintiff. <em>In my judgment the
                            words ‘in respect of’ are wide enough to embrace such a
                            claim</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Nicholls LJ, who agreed that the
                    partnership’s claim was for damages resulting from the personal injuries,
                    further observed that (at 40-41):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If [a] patient suffers physical injury as a result of negligent treatment
                        by his doctor or dentist, he may bring an action in negligence or for breach
                        of contract. The damages recoverable will include general damages in respect
                        of the physical injury and pain and suffering. They will also include
                        damages for financial loss resulting from the physical injury, such as loss
                        of future earnings. In such a case the claim for financial loss is as much a
                        claim for ‘damages in respect of personal injuries’ as is the
                        claim for damages in respect of the physical injury itself. <em>The plaintiff could not step outside the three-year limitation
                            period prescribed by s 11 by abandoning any claim for damages in
                            respect of the physical injury and claiming only damages in respect of
                            his loss of earnings</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Walkin</em>, the
                    plaintiff became pregnant after a sterilisation procedure she had undergone was
                    performed negligently. She sued for damages for the costs of raising the child
                    and only issued her writ outside the three year limitation period. Having found
                    that the unwanted pregnancy was a “personal injury” suffered by
                    the plaintiff, the English Court of Appeal held that her claim was
                    time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Auld LJ held (at 1551) that the question
                    of whether an action was for damages in respect of personal injury was
                    “one of substance, not a matter of pleading”. He also disagreed
                    (at 1549) with the view that an unwanted pregnancy gave rise to two separate
                    causes of action, one for pre-natal pain and suffering and the other for
                    post-natal economic loss. Instead, he was of the view that both claims arose
                    from the same cause of action. On the facts, Auld LJ found that the
                    negligence had caused the unwanted pregnancy which gave rise to the claim for
                    damages for the costs of raising the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Neill LJ agreed with Auld LJ’s
                    view that an unwanted pregnancy did not give rise to two separate causes of
                    action. He found that the claim for the economic costs of raising the child
                    could not be separated from the claim for the personal injury. In this regard,
                    Neill LJ echoed Nicholls LJ’s view in <em>Howe</em> (see above at [70]) that the plaintiff could not step
                    outside the three year limitation by abandoning any claim in respect of the
                    physical injury and only claiming damages in respect of the costs of raising the
                    child (at 1555–1556).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     
          <em>Bennett</em> and the
                    line of cases preceding it were considered by Singer J in the English High
                    Court decision of <em>Oates v Harte
                        Reade &amp; Co</em> [1999] PNLR 763 (“<em>Oates</em>”). The plaintiff in that case sued
                    solicitors who had previously acted for her in matrimonial proceedings. The
                    plaintiff alleged she had lost her home and had suffered from stress and anxiety
                    as a result of the defendant’s negligence. The defendant applied to strike
                    out the claim on the ground that it included damages in respect of personal
                    injury and that it was commenced after the three year limitation period had
                    expired. The plaintiff then applied to amend her statement of claim so as to
                    abandon the portion claiming damages for stress and anxiety. A Master allowed
                    the plaintiff’s amendment at first instance and the defendant
                    appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     On appeal, Singer J followed <em>Bennett</em> and held that as the plaintiff’s claim, in
                    its original form, <em>included</em> a prayer for damages
                    for personal injuries, the <em>entire claim</em> was
                    subject to a three year limitation period under s 11 of the 1980 UK Act.
                    Singer J proceeded to consider whether the plaintiff should be allowed to
                    amend her statement of claim to abandon the prayer for damages for stress and
                    anxiety under O 20 r 5(1) and (2) of the UK Rules of the Supreme Court
                    (“the UK RSC”) which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) …[T]he Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the
                        plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, on such
                        terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as
                        it may direct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment
                        mentioned in paragraph … (5) is made after any relevant period of
                        limitation current at the date of issue of the writ has expired, the Court
                        may nevertheless grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that
                        paragraph if it thinks it just to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding
                        that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new cause of
                        action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or
                        substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief
                        has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to
                        make the amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Singer J accepted that the amendments
                    sought did not amount to adding or substituting a new cause of action. The
                    learned judge also accepted, that under O 20 r 5(1) of the UK RSC, he
                    had a wide discretion to allow the amendment sought by the plaintiff. Yet, he
                    declined to exercise his discretion on the ground that it would deprive the
                    defendant of a “cast-iron” limitation defence. Singer J
                    elaborated thus (at 774–775):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ultimate question is therefore one of discretion under [O 20
                        r 5(1)]. … I believe that the provisions of both statute and
                        rules … contain powerful indicators of how the judicial discretion
                        should be approached in a case such as this. The words
                        “nevertheless” and “notwithstanding” point up
                        that the court, if it permits such addition or substitution, is acting in an
                        unusual and indeed extreme manner. Yet there envisaged are situations where
                        what is sought is the addition or substitution of a claim which would have
                        been valid in terms of limitation periods at the time of issue of the writ,
                        even though that period has since expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>But to allow the amendment sought in this action would
                            deprive the defendant of a good limitation defence which has arisen out
                            of the way in which the plaintiff has chosen to plead her case. In the
                            light of my conclusion that the three-year limitation period applied in
                            this action as pleaded up to the point when it reached the Master, this
                            is therefore a case where the limitation defence has been throughout
                            available to the defendant.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Singer J’s reasoning was criticised
                    by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Shade v The Compton
                        Partnership</em> [2000] PNLR 218 (“<em>Shade</em>”). In <em>Shade</em>, the
                    plaintiff had instructed the defendant solicitors to sue his former solicitors
                    for negligently carrying out a conveyancing transaction. However, a writ was not
                    issued in time and the plaintiff’s claim against his conveyancing
                    solicitors was time-barred as a result. The plaintiff then commenced proceedings
                    against the defendant. Apart from claiming damages for financial loss, the
                    plaintiff claimed that that the defendant’s professional negligence had
                    caused him to suffer physical and psychiatric damage. The plaintiff, however,
                    served his writ after the three year limitation period for personal injuries
                    claims and the defendant applied to strike out the claim on the ground that it
                    was time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     At first instance, the plaintiff’s
                    action was struck out. On appeal, the court accepted (at 219) that, as the
                    damages claimed by the plaintiff included damages in respect of personal
                    injuries, a limitation period of three years applied to the action. However,
                    instead of striking out the plaintiff’s action, the court granted leave to
                    the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim to sever the personal injury
                    claims. Walker LJ, who delivered the leading judgment, noted at the outset
                    that (at 223):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A] pleading should not be struck out as hopeless if it is one
                        that can be cured by a permissible amendment. That is why the question of a
                        possible amendment should be considered on a strike out application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In so far as the decision in <em>Oates</em> was concerned, Walker LJ described (at 224) the
                        reasoning in that case as being “less than fully
                        satisfactory”. He continued thus (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It may be arid to discuss whether the deletion of a part of pleading
                        should be regarded as the substitution of one cause of action for another.
                        It is possible to think of some cases in which that would, at least at first
                        sight, be so, such as a case where the deletion of the single word
                        “fraudulently” might substitute a claim based on innocent
                        misrepresentation for one based on deceit. Simply to delete parts of the
                        damages claimed to have been caused by a single breach of duty is not easily
                        described as a substitution as it is clearly not an addition to a
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Walker LJ went on to disagree with the
                    view expressed in <em>Oates</em> that an amendment should
                    be refused if it would have deprived the defendant of a limitation defence that
                    he would have had at the time of service of the writ. He observed as follows (at
                    224–225):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Depriving a defendant on an accrued limitation defence by amendment,
                            <em>is a material factor in the exercise of the
                            court’s discretion when, and it seems to me only when, the
                            claimant could not usefully start new proceedings</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I consider that Mr Shade should have been given the opportunity, had
                        the case taken that route of seeking permission to amend his statement of
                        claim so as to delete the claims for damages for personal injuries so far as
                        the Master’s order, if upheld, did not automatically do that for him.
                        I consider that such permission ought not to be refused on limitation
                        grounds because the new claim (and it can be called that in the loose sense)
                        would not have been statute barred if raised in new proceedings commenced at
                        the time of the hearing before the Master.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Finally, Walker LJ (at 225–226)
                    sought to distinguish the earlier Court of Appeal decision in <em>Walkin</em> in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Walkin</em> was a case of a claim for damages in
                        respect of an unwanted pregnancy which followed after an unsuccessful
                        operation for female sterilisation. <em>The whole claim, both
                            as to pain and as to economic loss, followed solely from the effect of
                            the unsuccessful medical treatment on the plaintiff’s physical
                            condition.</em> The fact that a second writ was issued in that
                        case claiming economic loss only could not alter the character of that
                        particular and unusual type of claim … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In such cases, the learned judge was of the view that
                            <em>common sense</em> should dictate whether an
                        amendment should be allowed to sever the personal injuries
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For completeness, we also note that the
                    leading textbooks on the subject of limitation periods have endorsed the
                    approach taken by Walker LJ in <em>Shade</em>. Andrew
                    McGee, for example, in his book titled <em>Limitation
                        Periods</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th ed, 2010) has
                    opined (at p 159) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that Robert Walker L.J. [in <em>Shade</em>] is right. Although the point is not expressly dealt
                        with in the CPR, in most cases there will be no reason to refuse to allow
                        such an amendment – a claimant ought to be allowed to abandon any part
                        of his claim at any time, subject, of course, to any appropriate costs
                        orders which might follow from that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Rodney Nelson-Jones, Frank Burton QC and Andrew Roy, the
                        learned authors of <em>Personal Injury Limitation
                            Law</em> (Tottel Publishing, 2nd ed, 2007), similarly take
                        the view (at p 24) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would therefore seem permissible for a claimant in certain
                        circumstances where the personal injury is not very substantial and where
                        the injury itself has not directly caused economic loss to sever off that
                        part of the claim to avoid the 3 year primary limitation period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Returning, then, to the case before this
                    court, for the reasons set out below, we would respectfully differ from the
                    Judge’s conclusion that, because the Appellant has claimed damages for
                    personal injuries in relation to some of his pleaded causes of action, a
                    limitation period of three years applies to his <em>entire
                        suit</em>. Citing the cases of <em>Walkin</em>,
                        <em>Bennett</em> and <em>Oates</em>, however, Mr Khoo submits that the Judge was correct
                    in reaching the conclusion which he did. Mr Khoo states that s 24A(2)
                    applies to any “action” where the damages claimed “consist
                    of or include” damages in respect of personal injuries. He further points
                    out that “action” is defined by s 2(1) of the Act to include
                    “a suit or any proceedings in court”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     With respect, we are unable to agree with the
                        <em>overly literal interpretation</em> of s 24A(2)
                    which Mr Khoo seeks to advance. In our judgment, where a plaintiff’s
                    suit comprises several causes of action, the three year limitation period under
                        <em>s 24A(2) only applies to the causes of action under
                        which the Appellant has claimed damages for personal injury and not more
                        generally to the entire suit</em>. This is borne out by the following.
                    First, the entire scheme of the Act is such that the relevant limitation period
                    would depend on the nature of the cause of action that is pleaded. Secondly, the
                    definition of “action” which Mr Khoo cites is an inclusive,
                    as opposed to an exhaustive, one. Thirdly, reading the word
                    “action” contextually, especially in the light of s 24A(1),
                    it is plain to us that it refers to actions for breach of duty. Fourthly, under
                    the Rules, a plaintiff is both permitted, and as a matter of practice, likely,
                    to join as many causes of action as he has against a defendant in a single suit.
                    If Mr Khoo’s contentions are accepted, a plaintiff might be better
                    off commencing separate actions to avoid limitation issues. This would be highly
                    undesirable from the viewpoints of expediency as well as the saving of costs.
                    Finally, the cases cited by Mr Khoo do not stand as authority for the
                    proposition which he cites them for. Although alternative causes of action in
                    negligence and breach of contract were pleaded in <em>Walkin</em>, <em>Bennett</em> and <em>Oates</em>, damages for personal injuries were claimed in
                    relation to each cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     At the hearing of the appeal, we raised the
                    possibility of the Appellant being allowed to amend his statement of claim in
                    order <em>to abandon his claims for damages for personal
                        injury</em>. Mr Khoo conceded that, based on the decision in
                        <em>Shade</em>, this court <em>did</em> have the discretion to allow such an amendment. In our view,
                    Mr Khoo’s concession was <em>properly made</em>.
                    In this regard, we fully agree with the reasoning of Walker LJ in <em>Shade</em> (see above at [77]–[80]) and would
                    gratefully apply it here. As was the case in <em>Shade</em>, even if the Appellant’s causes of action which claim
                    damages in respect of personal injuries are struck out, the Appellant will be
                        <em>within the six year limitation period</em> and can
                    commence fresh proceedings if such damages are not claimed. Therefore, we do not
                    see how the Respondent would be prejudiced if the aforementioned amendment is
                    allowed. In fairness to Mr Khoo, he did not in any event adopt such a
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We should, however, point out that it is
                    unclear from <em>Shade</em> whether such an amendment
                    should similarly be allowed if, at the time of the proposed amendment, the
                    plaintiff is also out of time to commence fresh proceedings in which damages for
                    personal injuries are <em>not</em> claimed. Although this
                    point was, not taken before us, we would, <em>parenthetically</em>, observe that there appears to be <em>no reason</em> to disallow such an amendment in <em>every</em> case. As a matter of <em>principle</em>, any amendments made to the writ would date back to
                    the date the writ was <em>originally filed</em> (see, for
                    example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Warner v
                        Sampson</em> [1959] QB 297 at 321). Hence, if the limitation period is
                    current at the date the writ was filed, then the action, <em>as
                        amended</em>, will be deemed to have been commenced within time. As a
                    matter of <em>policy</em>, we do not think that the
                    question of <em>prejudice</em> to the defendant should
                    turn, <em>purely</em>, on whether the proposed amendment
                    would deprive the defendant of a <em>technical</em>
                    limitation defence which it could avail itself of now were a fresh writ to be
                    filed but which would not have been available at the time the original writ was
                    filed. Although limitation periods exist to protect defendants from stale claims
                    being instituted against them, this must be <em>balanced</em> against the need to ensure that <em>meritorious claims are not unduly stifled by procedural
                        requirements</em>. In our view, therefore, the issue of prejudice is
                    one that depends, in the final analysis, on the <em>facts and
                        circumstances of each case</em>, and, in particular, whether under the
                    original pleading, the defendant was given <em>fair
                        notice</em> of the claim being brought against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Applying what we have stated above to the case
                    before us, we are of the view that the following of the Appellant’s claims
                    are for <em>damages in respect of personal injuries</em>:
                    (a) general damages for assault and battery; (b) general damages for
                    assault and battery (humiliation); (c) general damages for excessive use of
                    force; (d) general damages for intentional infliction of emotional
                    distress; and (e) damages for economic loss. In so far as item (e) is
                    concerned, although the Appellant attaches the <em>label</em> of “economic loss” to his claim, it is, in
                        <em>substance</em>, a claim for damages in respect of
                    personal injuries. Conversely, the following heads of damages claimed by the
                    Appellant are <em>not</em> damages in respect of personal
                    injuries and can be properly severed from the claims which are: (a) general
                    damages for loss of liberty arising from false imprisonment; (b) aggravated
                    damages for loss of liberty arising from false imprisonment; (c) general
                    damages for defamation; and (d) punitive damages for malicious prosecution,
                    wrongful arrest and abuse of process. It should be pointed out that the
                    Respondent takes the position that there are other grounds for striking out the
                    Appellant’s causes of action in malicious prosecution, abuse of process
                    and defamation. We will come to these grounds later in our judgment. It suffices
                    however, at this juncture, to state that, subject to our decision on those
                    particular matters, we would be minded to allow the Appellant to amend his
                    statement of claim to abandon his claims for damages for personal
                    injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Unfortunately, given how the parties chose to
                    argue their respective cases, neither party took the point as to whether, as a
                    matter of <em>law</em>, if a cause of action pleaded by the
                    Appellant includes a claim for damages for personal injury, the three year
                    limitation period under s 24A(2) would apply to bar the <em>entire</em> cause of action, or whether, the three year limitation
                    period would only apply <em>in so far as damages were claimed in
                        respect of personal injury</em>. As alluded to earlier, an argument
                    was made by the plaintiff in <em>Walkin</em> that the
                    unwanted pregnancy gave rise to <em>two</em> causes of
                    action, one for damages for pre-natal pain and suffering and the other for
                    post-natal economic loss incurred in raising the child. This argument did not
                    find favour with the English Court of Appeal, which held that both claims for
                    damages arose from a <em>single</em> cause of action.
                    Without intending to cast any doubt on the correctness of the decision in
                        <em>Walkin</em>, we do not, with respect, think that
                        <em>Walkin</em> settles the position in so far as the
                    point raised at the beginning of this paragraph is concerned. In this regard, we
                    agree with Walker LJ’s observation in <em>Shade</em> that <em>Walkin</em> was a case where
                    the claim for economic loss was <em>closely related</em>
                    to, and therefore <em>could not be severed</em> from, the
                    personal injury suffered by the plaintiff (<em>ie</em>, the
                    unwanted pregnancy). It is therefore not difficult to see why the court in
                        <em>Walkin</em> rejected the argument which the
                    plaintiff had sought to advance. In our view, the position is less clear in
                    cases such as <em>Shade</em> where the claim for damages
                    for personal injuries can be properly severed from the rest of the claim. It
                    seems to us that, in these cases, it is at least arguable that the various heads
                    of damages claimed give rise to separate causes of action, with the effect that
                    the limitation period under s 24A(2) would only apply in so far as damages
                    are claimed for personal injuries. In any event, as the point was not taken
                    before us and since what we have stated above at [84]–[85] makes it
                    unnecessary to deal with this point, we say nothing further on it and leave it
                    for decision if a suitable case arises in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Given our conclusion that the
                    Appellant’s suit is not absolutely time-barred, it becomes necessary to
                    consider the Respondent’s arguments that there are other grounds for
                    striking out the Appellant’s claims in malicious prosecution, abuse of
                    process and defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s constitutional argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     To buttress his causes of action in malicious
                    prosecution and abuse of process, the Appellant raises a preliminary argument
                    concerning the interpretation of Art 9(4) of the Constitution of the
                    Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”). This
                    Article reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)  Where a person is arrested and not released, he shall,
                        without unreasonable delay, and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the
                        time of any necessary journey), be produced before a Magistrate, in person
                        or by way of video-conferencing link (or other similar technology) in
                        accordance with law, and shall not be further detained in custody without
                        the Magistrate’s authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The rationale underlying Art 9(4) of the
                    Constitution is explained by Prof Thio Li-Ann as follows (see <em>A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law</em> (Academy
                    Publishing. 2012) at para 12.076):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 9(4) provides for the time period by which a person arrested
                        and not released shall be brought before a Magistrate in person or by
                        virtual means. This should be done “without unreasonable
                        delay” and at any rate “within 48 hours”. Further
                        detention must be made with the Magistrate’s authority. <em>This rule requires that the judicial mind is immediately
                            directed towards the legality of an arrest and detention.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It will be evident from the language of
                    Art 9(4) that it requires an arrested person, <em>if not
                        released earlier</em>, to be brought before a Magistrate without
                    “unreasonable delay”. This means that Art 9(4) may be
                    violated <em>even where</em> an arrested person is brought
                    before a Magistrate within the 48 hour period, if the time taken to do so
                    amounted to “unreasonable delay” in all the circumstances of the
                    case. Likewise, the fact that a person is released, whether on police bail or
                    otherwise, within the 48 hour period, does not necessarily preclude the
                    possibility of Art 9(4) being contravened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is, however, also plainly the case that
                    Art 9(4) does not confer an arrested person with an unqualified right to be
                    brought before a Magistrate immediately upon his arrest. Rather, it recognises
                    the need to afford the police a reasonable time in which to carry out their
                    investigations. This point is further accentuated by the 1984 amendments to the
                    Constitution which extended the maximum period for which a person could be
                    detained from 24 to the present 48 hours. At the second reading, the then
                    Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, explained the rationale for the longer
                    time period to be as follows (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (24 July 1984) vol 44 at
                    col 1723)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The amendment is necessary to enable the Police to investigate offences
                        more thoroughly. The present 24-hour limit places undue constraints on
                        police investigations. As the Courts sit only during normal office hours,
                        this means that, in practice, suspects who are arrested at night or outside
                        office hours will have to be produced in court sometimes in a matter of
                        eight to ten hours. By extending the limit to 48 hours, the Police will be
                        in a better position to complete their investigations and to carry out
                        follow-up action …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In our view, therefore, Art 9(4) requires the right of
                        the individual against arbitrary detention upon arrest to be <em>balanced</em> against the need to afford the police
                        reasonable time in which to carry out their
                investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The need to balance an <em>individual’s constitutional rights</em> against <em>other public interest considerations</em> was also alluded to
                    in this court’s recent decision in <em>James
                        Raj s/o Ariokasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [2014]
                    3 SLR 750 (“<em>James Raj</em>”).
                        <em>James Raj</em> concerned an application for leave
                    to refer a question of law of public interest to this court under s 397(1)
                    of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) as to the
                    interpretation of Art 9(3) of the Constitution
                    (“Art 9(3)”). Art 9(3) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)  Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as
                        may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be
                        defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In dismissing the application for leave, this court regarded
                        its earlier decision in <em>Jasbir Singh and another v Public
                            Prosecutor</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 782 (“<em>Jasbir Singh</em>”) as settling the position that
                        the right to counsel under Art 9(3) was not exercisable immediately,
                        but, rather, only after a reasonable time, observing as follows (at
                        [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Jasbir Singh</em>, this Court had considered
                        what, at that time, was the only existing Singapore authority on the ambit
                        of the constitutional right of access to counsel, namely the High Court
                        decision in <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> [[1971–1973]
                        SLR(R) 135]. <b><em>There, it had been held that an arrested
                            person who wished to consult a legal practitioner of his choice was
                            entitled to have this constitutional right granted to him by the
                            authority having custody of him within a reasonable time after his
                            arrest</em></b> (<em>Lee Mau Seng</em> at [12]).
                        The Court of Appeal in <em>Jasbir Singh</em> noted that
                        while <em>Lee Mau Seng</em> did not elaborate on what a
                        “reasonable time” would be, it could be surmised that
                            <b><em>an allowance for police investigations and procedure
                            was intended to be incorporated within the framework of a
                            “reasonable time”</em></b> (<em>Jasbir
                            Singh</em> at [48]). The exercise of the right of access to
                        counsel was framed in this way <b><em>to strike a balance that
                            was considered appropriate to our circumstances between, on the one
                            hand, the arrested person’s undoubted right to legal
                            representation and, on the other hand, the public interest in enabling
                            the police to discharge their duty and carry out investigations
                            effectively and expeditiously</em></b> (<em>Jasbir
                            Singh</em> at [46]). [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Returning then to the present case, the
                    Appellant contended that under Art 9(4), the police were <em>obliged</em> to bring him before a Magistrate for a determination of
                    whether there were reasonable grounds for this arrest, or in the
                    Appellant’s words, a “probable cause hearing”. As he was not
                    produced before a Magistrate but instead released on police bail, the Appellant
                    submitted that his constitutional right under Art 9(4) had been
                    violated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     We do not agree with the Appellant’s
                    contention. In accordance with what we have stated above, it will be evident
                    that Art 9(4) does <em>not</em> confer a right upon an
                    arrested person to be brought before a Magistrate upon his arrest in <em>every</em> case. Rather, <em>the right of the
                        arrested person is more accurately characterised as one to not be detained
                        for a period that is unreasonable in the circumstances, and which in any
                        event does not exceed 48 hours, unless he is brought before a
                        Magistrate</em>. If the arrested person is released within a
                    reasonable time after his arrest, he does not have to be brought before a
                    Magistrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Appellant is therefore incorrect in
                    arguing that Art 9(4) was contravened <em>merely</em>
                    because he was not taken before a Magistrate upon his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Malicious prosecution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In <em>Zainal bin Kuning and
                        ors v Chan Sin Mian Michael and anor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 858
                        (“<em>Zainal</em>”), this court held (at
                    [54]) that in order to establish a cause of action in malicious prosecution, a
                    plaintiff must show: (a) he was prosecuted by the defendant, that is, the
                    law must be set in motion against him on a criminal charge; (b) the
                    prosecution was determined in his favour; (c) the prosecution was without
                    reasonable and probable cause; and (d) the prosecution was
                    malicious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Mr Khoo contends that the first
                    requirement in <em>Zainal</em> is not satisfied in the case
                    before us because the Appellant was not charged, and therefore, not
                    “prosecuted”. We agree. As the Privy Council observed in <em>Amin v Bannerjee</em> [1947] AC 322 at 330:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The foundation of the action [of malicious prosecution] <em>lies in abuse of the process of the court by wrongfully setting the law
                            in motion</em>, and it is designed to discourage the perversion of
                        the machinery of justice for an improper purpose. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The learned authors of <em>Clerk and Lindsell
                            on Torts</em> (Michael A Jones gen ed)
                        (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th ed, 2010) likewise define a
                        “prosecution” to mean (at para 16-11):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>What is a prosecution?</b> In establishing the
                        first essential element of the tort of malicious prosecution two key issues
                        must be addressed, what constitutes a prosecution? And who is the
                        prosecutor? To prosecute is to set the law in motion, and the law is only
                        set in motion by an appeal to some person clothed with judicial authority in
                        regard to the matter in question, and to be liable for malicious prosecution
                        a person must at least be actively instrumental in so setting the law in
                        motion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>A prosecution therefore requires that the criminal law is set
                        in motion against the plaintiff either on a criminal charge or under a
                        private prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     We should state that the Appellant accepts
                    that a prosecution requires the criminal law to be set in motion against him.
                    However, he argues that a prosecution commenced at the time of his arrest as the
                    criminal law ought to have been set in motion by the “probable cause
                    hearing” that he was entitled to, but did not receive, under
                    Art 9(4) of the Constitution. As we have explained above at
                    [89]–[96], Art 9(4) did not provide the Appellant with the right that
                    he contends for. His arguments in this regard must therefore fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It follows that the claim for malicious
                    prosecution plainly does <em>not</em> disclose a reasonable
                    cause of action and should be struck out. We are not minded, and it is indeed
                    not necessary for us, to make any finding on the issue of <em>malice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In relation to the Appellant’s claim
                    for an abuse of process, it should be noted at the outset that it is unclear
                    whether this is a recognised free standing cause of action at law and further,
                    whether this is a cause of action capable of giving rise to a claim <em>for damages</em>. In <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
                        (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”), the High Court
                    noted (at [130]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the concept of “abuse of process” is not a precise
                        one, its essence is the use of the judicial process for a purpose for which
                        it is not intended or in circumstances where the extraneous purpose is the
                        dominant purpose for its use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Similar sentiments were expressed by the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Land Securities
                        Plc &amp; Ors v Fladgate Fielder (A Firm)</em> [2010] Ch
                    467, where Moore-Bick LJ observed as follows (at [77]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the concept of abuse of process is well known to the law, both in
                        civil and criminal proceedings, <em>it has rarely been
                            treated as giving rise to a cause of action</em>. More commonly it
                        is relied on as a ground for terminating proceedings that constitute an
                        abuse and as such is a flexible concept for preventing injustice. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It will also be evident from this that
                    courts have generally regarded the concept of an abuse of process as referring
                    to an <em>abuse of the judicial process</em>. On this note,
                    Mr Khoo submits that, as no judicial proceedings were commenced against the
                    Appellant, there could be no abuse of process. Conversely, the Appellant
                    contends that there could be an abuse of process because the judicial process
                        <em>ought to have been invoked</em> by bringing him
                    before a Magistrate for a probable cause hearing, in accordance with
                    Art 9(4) of the Constitution. He further contends that the abuse of process
                    lies in the Attorney-General’s direction to the police not to take him
                    before a Magistrate in contravention of the same article of the Constitution. In
                    this regard, the Appellant cites <em>Phyllis Tan</em> where
                    the court held (at [148]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the law, the Attorney-General must act according to law, as his
                        prosecutorial power is not unfettered … First, he may not use his
                        prosecutorial power in bad faith for an extraneous purpose. Second, he may
                        not use it so as to contravene constitutional rights, such as the right to
                        equality before the law and the equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In our view, the Appellant’s
                    contentions are untenable. We find that there was <em>no</em> abuse of the judicial process for the simple reason that
                    judicial proceedings were never commenced against the Appellant in the first
                    place as he was not charged. Further, for the reasons which we stated above at
                    [89]–[96], we disagree with the Appellant’s suggestion that judicial
                    proceedings ought to been commenced against him by bringing him before a
                    Magistrate. For the same reasons, under the principles enunciated in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> (see above at [103]), the Attorney-General
                    did not act in excess of his prosecutorial powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In the event, the claim for abuse of process
                    discloses no reasonable cause of action and should be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    To establish a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of defamation, a plaintiff must prove the following
                    three elements: (a) the statement must be defamatory in nature;
                    (b) the statement must refer to the plaintiff; and (c) the statement
                    must be published (see Gary Chan Kok Yew, <em>The Law of Torts in
                        Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011) (“<em>Law of Torts in Singapore</em>”) at
                para 12.009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    As already mentioned, the Appellant relies
                    on two statements to make out his claim in defamation. The first is the police
                    officer’s statement “breach of PPO” when asked by the doctor
                    at CGH about the Appellant’s wrongdoing. The second is the doctor’s
                    comment that the Appellant had only suffered a “small
                    injury”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    As a preliminary point, we note that the
                    Appellant’s claim in defamation is deficient as <em>matter
                        of pleading</em>. In this regard, O 78 r 3 of the Rules is germane and
                    it sets out the particulars which must be provided when pleading a claim in
                    defamation:</p>

                        facts on which he relies in support of the allegation of malice, but if the
                        defendant pleads that any of those words or matters are fair comment on a

                        the plaintiff intends to allege that the defendant was actuated by express
                        malice, he must serve a reply giving particulars of the facts and matters

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Applying O 78 r 3 of the Rules to
                    the present case, it was incumbent upon the Appellant to: (a) identify
                    whether the offending words were defamatory in their ordinary meaning or in
                    terms of innuendo; and (b) set out all the facts and particulars which he
                    intended to rely upon to support his claim for damages. In the context of
                    point (b), we note that the Appellant had failed to plead particulars of
                    the extent of publication of the allegedly defamatory statements. Besides the
                    doctor and the police officer, the Appellant’s statement of claim did not
                    identify anyone else who was present in the examination room at the time the
                    alleged statements were made. Moreover the defamation here is a slander, as
                    opposed to a libel, and the common law rule is that a slander requires proof of
                    special damage (see <em>Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at
                    para 12.005), unless one of the statutory exceptions under ss 4, 5 and
                    6 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) applies, which was not the
                    case here. This court is unable to infer any special damage occasioned by the
                    slander from the Appellant’s pleaded case without which there is no cause
                    of action. In other words, the Appellant’s complaint of slander bears no
                    discernible cause of action, and is susceptible to being struck out under
                    O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>) or under the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    That having been said, we should not lose
                    sight of the fact that the Appellant’s claim in defamation is also legally
                    unsustainable in other respects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In relation to the doctor’s comment,
                    we agree with Mr Khoo’s submission that the <em>proper
                        defendant</em> to such a claim is the doctor himself or his employers.
                    The Respondent <em>cannot</em> be made liable for
                    statements made by the employees of CGH, which is privately managed by Changi
                    General Hospital Pte Ltd. We also note that the Appellant did not assert to the
                    contrary in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In relation to the police officer’s
                    statement, the Respondent first contends that the statement was made on an
                    occasion of qualified privilege. The law in this regard is <em>settled</em>. The defence of qualified privilege applies where the
                    defendant to a defamation suit has an <em>interest or
                        duty</em>, whether legal, social or moral, to communicate the
                    information and the recipient has a <em>corresponding interest or
                        duty</em> to receive the information: see <em>Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> at para 13.063. It is also pertinent to
                    note in this regard that the privilege attaches to the <em>occasion</em> on which the defamatory statement is made <em>and not the statement itself</em>: see this court’s
                    decision in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei</em>
                    [2010] 4 SLR 331 at [34]. There is, therefore, <em>no need
                        to apply an objective test of relevance to every part of the defamatory
                        matter as a pre-condition to the existence of the privilege</em>: see
                        <em>ibid</em>. However, it is equally important to note
                    that the aforementioned is <em>subject to</em> the
                    following <em>caveat</em> which is succinctly explained by
                    the learned author of <em>Law of Torts in Singapore</em> in
                    the following terms (at para 13.062):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even though a statement may be published on a privileged occasion, parts
                        of the statement which are <b><em>totally irrelevant or
                            extraneous</em></b> may nevertheless fall outside the ambit of the
                        defence. Such irrelevant or extraneous words may constitute evidence of
                        malice. <b><em>However, if those parts of the statements are
                            relevant but excessive or exaggerated, they would remain protected by
                            the defence</em></b>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In the present case, the Appellant appeared
                    to acknowledge (correctly, in our view) that, as he was under arrest at the time
                    of the medical examination, the <em>relationship</em>
                    between the police officer and the doctor was such that the police officer had a
                    duty or an interest to answer the doctor’s questions. He <em>nonetheless</em> contended that qualified privilege <em>did not apply on the facts of this case</em> because the
                    doctor was not under a <em>duty</em> to include details of
                    the Appellant’s wrongdoing in his medical report, because it contributed
                    nothing to the Appellant’s diagnosis and his treatment, and, therefore,
                    the doctor could not be said to have a corresponding duty or interest to receive
                    the information communicated by the police officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    With respect, we are <em>unable</em> to agree with the Appellant’s submission which, in
                    our view, is <em>overly pedantic</em>. As stated above (at
                    [112]), the test as to whether the police officer’s statement was made on
                    an occasion of qualified privilege <em>does not require an
                        objective test of relevance to be applied to every statement
                    made</em>, but, rather, the issue is <em>whether the
                        statements made can be said to be plainly extraneous or
                        irrelevant</em>. It is therefore necessary to have regard to the full
                    context of what –
                    <em>according to the Appellant</em> – had transpired
                    in the medical examination. Pertinently, on the Appellant’s own case, when
                    he was brought to CGH for his medical examination, he was handcuffed and
                    escorted by the two police officers. It was in this light that the doctor had
                    first asked how the Appellant had gotten injured. Having been informed by the
                    Appellant that his wife had beaten him, it was not only logical but within the
                    scope of the doctor’s duty for him to inquire as to why the Appellant had
                    been arrested, or in the Appellant’s own words, his
                    “wrongdoing”. Moreover, the doctor had recorded in the
                    Appellant’s medical report that he was “arrested for breach of
                    PPO”. <em>Even if</em> the doctor was not under a
                    strict duty – or in other words, an obligation – to include this
                    information in the Appellant’s medical report, it <em>could
                        not</em> be said that the information requested was <em>plainly irrelevant or extraneous</em>, such that the police
                    officer’s statement was outside the ambit of the qualified privilege. We
                    also note, for completeness, that the Appellant <em>did not
                        suggest that the statement was motivated by malice</em>, such that the
                    defence of qualified privilege would be defeated. It follows from this that the
                    Appellant’s claim in defamation ought to be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    As a further basis for striking out the
                    Appellant’s claim in defamation, the Respondent contended that given the
                    extremely limited publication of the statements made by the doctor and the
                    police officer, the Appellant’s claim in defamation ought to be struck
                    out. In this regard, Mr Khoo cited the decision of the English Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones &amp; Co
                        Inc</em> [2005] QB 946 (“<em>Jameel</em>”). In <em>Jameel</em>, the
                    foreign claimant issued defamation proceedings in England against the publisher
                    of an American newspaper in respect of an article posted on a website in the
                    USA. The publisher adduced evidence showing that only five persons in the
                    jurisdiction had accessed the website, of which three persons were from the
                    claimant’s camp. The publisher subsequently applied to strike out the
                    claim on the ground that it had no reasonable prospect of success. Arguments
                    before the court proceeded on the basis that only five persons had viewed the
                    allegedly defamatory material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In striking out the claim, the court held
                    that there was no “real and substantial tort” allegedly committed
                    within the jurisdiction and that it would be an abuse of process for the
                    plaintiff to proceed with his claim, even though the publisher had not objected
                    to the jurisdiction of the English courts on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> earlier. The court observed (at [54], [69]
                    and [70]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    … An abuse of process is of concern not
                            merely to the parties but to the court. It is no longer the role of the
                            court simply to provide a level playing field and to referee whatever
                            game the parties choose to play upon it. The court is concerned to
                            ensure that judicial and court resources are appropriately and
                            proportionately used in accordance with the requirements of justice. If
                            [the publisher] have caused potential prejudice to the claimant by
                            failing to raise the points now pursued at the proper time, it does not
                            follow that the court must permit this action to continue. The court has
                            other means of dealing with such prejudice…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    If the claimant succeeds in this action and is
                            awarded a small amount of damages, it can perhaps be said that he will
                            have achieved vindication for the damage done to his reputation in this
                            country, but both the damage and the vindication will be minimal. The
                            cost of the exercise will have been out of all proportion to what has
                            been achieved. The game will not merely not have been worth the candle,
                            it will not have been worth the wick.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70    If we were considering an application to set aside
                            permission to serve these proceedings out of the jurisdiction we would
                            allow that application on the basis that the five publications that had
                            taken place in this jurisdiction did not, individually or collectively,
                            amount to a real and substantial tort. Jurisdiction is no longer in
                            issue, but, subject to the effect of the claim for an injunction that we
                            have yet to consider, we consider for precisely the same reason that it
                            would not be right to permit this action to proceed. It would be an
                            abuse of process to continue to commit the resources of the English
                            court, including substantial judge and possibly jury time, to an action
                            where so little is now seen to be at stake. Normally where a small claim
                            is brought, it will be dealt with by a proportionate small claims
                            procedure. Such a course is not available in an action for defamation
                            where, although the claim is small, the issues are complex and subject
                            to special procedure under the CPR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The decision of <em>Jameel</em> has been followed by the English High Court in <em>Phillip Wallis and GHP Securities Limited v Justin
                        Meredith</em> [2011] EWHC 75 (QB) and the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Tamiz v Google Inc</em> [2013] 1 WLR 2151.
                    Locally, <em>Jameel</em> was applied by Sundaresh
                    Menon JC (as he then was) in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Review Publishing Co Ltd and another and another
                        suit</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 453, albeit in the <em>different context</em> of a challenge to the jurisdiction of the
                    court by a defendant against whom the plaintiff had been granted leave to effect
                    service of the writ out of jurisdiction. <em>Jameel</em>
                    was also referred to (also in a <em>different context</em>)
                    in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Ng Koo Kay Benedict
                        and another v Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 860 at [44]. However, there was a direct application of <em>Jameel</em> in the Singapore District Court decision of
                        <em>Kesavan Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v
                        S P Powerassets Limited</em> [2011] SGDC 179.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It is also pertinent to note that since
                        <em>Jameel</em> was decided under a set of procedural
                    rules which are fundamentally different from those in Singapore (see, for
                    example, <em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (Alastair
                    Mullis &amp; Richard Parkes QC joint eds)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th ed, 2013) (“<em>Gatley</em>”) at para 30.48), and because it entails
                    – in part, at least – the (potentially far reaching) proposition
                    that an action may be struck out on the basis that the <em>publication</em> of the defamatory material is <em>limited</em>, or the <em>amount</em> claimed as
                    damages is <em>de minimis</em>, the principle enunciated in
                    that case should be approached with the <em>necessary
                        circumspection</em> by the Singapore courts. In this regard, we find
                    the following observations of the learned authors of <em>Gatley</em> (at para 6.2) to be instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the question whether there has been a real and substantial tort
                        cannot “depend upon a numbers game, with the court fixing an
                        arbitrary minimum according to the facts of the case” and the
                            <em>Jameel</em> jurisdiction should not be pushed
                        too far. It does not mean that any sort of mass production is always
                        necessary for a successful suit, otherwise claims for slander (which
                        sometimes lead to substantial awards of general damages) would largely
                        disappear. It is not difficult to conceive of claims for slanders or libels
                        with limited circulation which would cause the claimant great embarrassment
                        or distress or which might blight his financial prospects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We also note, however, that the same authors have also
                        observed as follows (at para 30.48):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the central principles are now tolerably clear, the precise nature
                        and reach of the jurisdiction is not. Despite it being axiomatic that it is
                        only in the most clear and obvious cases that it will be appropriate to
                        strike out proceedings as an abuse of process, it may be difficult to
                        predict with confidence in any particular case whether the court will or
                        will not agree that the claim is a <em>Jameel</em>
                        abuse. Moreover, an incorrect prediction may prove costly: it is not unusual
                        for <em>Jameel-</em>based applications to involve
                        in-depth scrutiny of the germane facts, circumstances and evidence.
                        Nevertheless, what unifies the authorities that make up the relevant
                        jurisprudence is that in each case it was open to the defendant, generally
                        at an early stage, to present the claim as one that was, for one reason or
                        another, trivial or pointless, such that it would be disproportionate to
                        permit it to proceed any further. The question of whether it is or is not
                        proportionate for the proceedings to continue is answered by the court with
                        reference to what is in essence a cost-benefit calculation,
                        “cost” in terms of the parties’ costs and, perhaps more
                        importantly, the impact upon the court’s increasingly hard-pressed
                        resources, and “benefit” in terms of the true value to the
                        claimant of any realistically available remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In another leading work, <em>Carter-Ruck on Libel and Privacy</em> (Alastair
                    Mullis &amp; Cameron Doley gen eds) (LexisNexis, 6th ed,
                    2010), it is observed as follows (at para 28.44):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of particular importance in defamation actions is the category of abuse
                        established by the Court of Appeal in <em>Jameel v Dow Jones
                            and Co</em> which is related not to the conduct of the parties but
                        derives from the principle of proportionality. If a publication is unlikely
                        to have caused the claimant significant damage within the jurisdiction there
                        is no prospect of the court granting an injunction to restrain further
                        publication and the claimant would be entitled only to nominal damages; the
                        claim may be struck out as an abuse of process on the basis that the cost of
                        pursuing proceedings would be out of all proportion to the minimal
                        vindication that would be achieved. The sanction will not be appropriate in
                        every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>However, there are also reservations expressed in the context
                        of the <em>application</em> of <em>Jameel</em> itself in the footnotes to the extract just cited.
                        For example, in note 3, it is submitted that “there is no reason of
                        principle why the category of abuse [in <em>Jameel</em>] should be limited to cases in which the damage to the
                        claimant’s reputation is minimal only when it is so because of the
                        size of the publication”. And, in note 7, it is noted that
                        “[p]ublication to a limited number of people may still be very
                        damaging”, observing that “[i]n <em>Sanders v
                            Percy</em> [2009] EWHC 1870 (QB) the court declined to order that
                        an action based on publication to the claimant’s solicitor was an
                        abuse in circumstances in which the allegation was a serious one made by a
                        court officer”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In the court below, the Judge, in following
                        <em>Jameel</em>, held that the Appellant’s claim
                    in defamation did not disclose a “real and substantial tort” and,
                    on that note, was an abuse of process of the court and ought to be struck out.
                    On appeal, Mr Khoo invited us to make a determination to the same effect.
                    In light of our decision above at [111]–[114], it is, <em>strictly speaking</em>, not necessary for us to decide whether the
                    Judge was correct in following <em>Jameel</em>. That having
                    been said, there is a relatively significant body of authority in England
                    endorsing the general principle established in <em>Jameel,
                        viz</em>, that a claim which discloses no real and substantial tort is
                    liable to be struck out for being an abuse of process of the court, and the real
                    concerns (as we have seen above) relate to its <em>application</em>. This last-mentioned point is not surprising in view
                    of the fact that the line-drawing required is not only fact-centric but may also
                    be difficult to effect in borderline situations. Further, and leaving aside the
                    differences in the rules of civil procedure between England and Singapore,
                        <em>Jameel</em> also contains some <em>general principles</em> that may be applicable in the Singapore
                    context. Hence, applying the principle in <em>Jameel</em>
                    to the facts of the present case, we would be of the view that this was far from
                    being a borderline situation and that the Judge was therefore correct in
                    following and applying <em>Jameel</em> and holding that the
                    Appellant’s claim in defamation did not disclose a real and substantial
                    tort. This would have served as a <em>yet further</em>
                    reason as to why the Appellant’s claim in defamation should
                fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    For completeness, we note the
                    Appellant’s argument that for the principle in <em>Jameel</em> to apply, the Respondent had to prove that the
                    publication was made to no more than five persons. With respect, we are unable
                    to agree. Bearing in mind our discussion above at [106], the burden of
                    establishing a cause of action in slander fell squarely on the Appellant. In the
                    context of publication of the words, and this relates to the question of who
                    heard the police officer’s statement apart from the doctor, the burden of
                    proving publication is also squarely on the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wrongful arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Before concluding, we wish to make some
                    observations regarding the Appellant’s claim for punitive damages for
                    wrongful arrest. At the hearing, it appeared to us that there was some confusion
                    between the parties as to whether this claim <em>had
                        been</em>, or for that matter, <em>should
                    be</em>, struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    At first instance, the AR found that the
                    Appellant was using the term “wrongful arrest” interchangeably
                    with false imprisonment. He therefore amended the first page of the
                    Appellant’s statement of claim to read “punitive damages for false
                    imprisonment”. He also allowed the claim for damages for loss of liberty
                    arising from false imprisonment to remain. The Respondent <em>did
                        not file an appeal</em> against the AR’s decision to allow these
                    claims to remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Judge, having found that the
                    Appellant’s <em>entire suit</em> was time-barred,
                    allowed the Appellant’s claim for damages for loss of liberty arising from
                    false imprisonment to remain as the Respondent did not appeal against the
                    “indulgence” granted by the AR to the Appellant (see GD at [54]).
                    It is not clear, however, whether the Judge also allowed the claim for punitive
                    damages for false imprisonment to remain. Indeed, the Judge did not <em>expressly</em> refer to this particular aspect of the
                    AR’s decision in his grounds. This is further complicated by the fact that
                    the Judge went on to find that a wrongful arrest was not an independent tort or
                    a cause of action, as distinct from false imprisonment. Curiously, in his notice
                    of appeal filed in Civil Appeal No 142 of 2013, the Appellant did not
                    appeal against the Judge’s decision to strike out his claim for wrongful
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    We are minded to uphold the AR’s
                    decision to amend the Appellant’s statement of claim to read
                    “punitive damages for false imprisonment”. At the hearing, the
                    Appellant clarified that he was using the terms “false
                    imprisonment” and “wrongful arrest” interchangeably. In
                    this regard, apart from arguing that the entire suit was time-barred (an
                    argument which we do not accept for reasons already stated), the Respondent did
                    not demonstrate why the Appellant’s claim for punitive damages for
                    wrongful arrest, <em>ie</em>, false imprisonment, should be
                    struck out. Consistently with our earlier observation (above at [86]) that the
                    punitive damages sought by the Appellant for his false imprisonment claim are
                    not “damages in respect of personal injuries” under s 24(2)
                    of the Act, and bearing in mind the Appellant’s clarification that he was
                    using the terms “false imprisonment” and “wrongful
                    arrest” interchangeably as well as the fact that the Respondent did not
                    file an appeal against the AR’s decision, we see no principled basis for
                    striking out the Appellant’s claim in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    For all the reasons set out above, we
                    dismiss the appeal. The net result, therefore, is that the AR’s decision
                    stands, which means that the Appellant’s false imprisonment claim (for
                    damages for loss of liberty and/or for punitive damages) is <em>not</em> struck out. The Appellant is to pay the Respondent’s
                    costs of the appeal, which are to be taxed if not agreed. There will be the
                    usual consequential orders.</p>
