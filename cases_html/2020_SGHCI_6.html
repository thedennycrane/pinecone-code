The ICC Award was issued by a tribunal (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Tribunal</span>”) of three arbitrators in an ICC Arbitration (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">ICC</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Arbitration</span>”) wherein BYN (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Investor</span>”)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>was the Claimant, while the Promoter and Company were the 1st and 3rd Respondents respectively. The Tribunal consisted of two co-arbitrators (respectively, Mr. [X] SA (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SA</span>”) and Mr. [Y] QC) and the chairperson (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Chairperson</span>”). The ICC Arbitration started on 11 February 2016. The 2nd Respondent in the Arbitration had been dissolved on 10 September 2015 and so did not play a material part in the ICC Arbitration. The seat of the ICC Arbitration is Singapore.  But, as found by the Tribunal, Indian law governs the arbitration agreement. The ICC Arbitration remains ongoing. SA has since resigned as co-arbitrator in the circumstances described below and has been replaced by Mr. [Z]. An oral hearing took place in the ICC Arbitration from 29 May to 1 June 2018. That was followed by several rounds of written closing submissions. On 22 March 2019 the Tribunal notified the parties that the arbitral proceedings were closed, and the Tribunal proceeded to its award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Plaintiffs’ setting aside application is premised on two grounds.  The first ground (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">put option ground</span>”) arises from the Tribunal’s decision to award reliefs under two put options in a shareholders’ agreement. According to the Plaintiffs, by the ICC Award the Tribunal ordered alternative reliefs. The Plaintiffs say that the Tribunal thus failed to decide the dispute before it and improperly conferred upon itself the power to change the ICC Award if part of it was later found to be unenforceable by a court. The second ground (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">bias ground</span>”) arises from the conduct of a Tribunal member. The latter is said to have made belated and only partial disclosures of a co-counsel relationship that he negotiated and entered into with the Investor’s legal representatives in the ICC Arbitration while the ICC Award was still being drafted and finalised. The relevant arbitrator’s circumstances are said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias (that is, apparent bias) vitiating the ICC Award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The dispute underlying the ICC Arbitration arose out of a Share Subscription and Shareholders Agreement dated 7 August 2008 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">SSHA</span>”) among the parties to the ICC Arbitration. The Company was set up by the Promoter as a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a development (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Development</span>”). Under the SSHA, the Investor became a 35% shareholder in the Company, with the Promoter holding the remaining 65%. The Investor was obliged under the SSHA to provide capital for the Development. In consideration for the Investor’s investment, the Promoter undertook to construct the Development by a commercial operation date (“<span class="font-weight-bold">COD</span>”) of 1 January 2012 and thereafter to promote the Development.  Construction was delayed, so that the Development only commenced operations on 23 September 2017, after the start of the ICC Arbitration. Part of the Development has yet to come into operation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Clauses 14 and 17 of the SSHA gave the Investor two put options. The clause 14 put option could be exercised upon the Promoter’s failure to undertake an IPO of the Company. By the clause 14 put option, the Promoter was obliged to purchase the Investor’s shares in the Company at their “Fair Market Value” (“<span class="font-weight-bold">FMV</span>”) as at a specified date. The clause 17 put option was exercisable upon an “Event of Default” (“<span class="font-weight-bold">EOD</span>”) as defined in clause 17, including delay to the Development’s COD and a material breach of the SSHA.  By the clause 17 put option, the Promoter was obliged to purchase the Investor’s shares in the Company at a price corresponding to an “Internal Rate of Return” (“<span class="font-weight-bold">IRR</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>) of 25% compounded annually. Clause 28.3 of the SSHA further provided that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Each of the rights of the Parties hereto under this [SSHA] are independent, cumulative and without prejudice to all other rights available to them, and the exercise or non-exercise of any such rights shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of any other right of the Party, whether under this [SSHA] or otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 1 April 2016 the Investor nominated Mr. [Y] as co-arbitrator. The Investor was represented by the Indian firm [AAA]. On 2 May 2016 the Investor informed the ICC and the Plaintiffs that an international firm of solicitors [BBB] (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the Firm</span>”) would act as co-counsel for the Investor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiffs nominated SA as arbitrator on 7 April 2016. SA practises as an independent counsel and as an arbitrator. He signed a Statement of Acceptance, Availability, Impartiality and Independence on 9 May 2016 when he was designated by the Plaintiffs as arbitrator. There SA disclosed that he was acting as mediator in a dispute between the two partners of [CCC] firm. [CCC] split into two firms, one of which, [DDD], had previously represented the Plaintiffs and had nominated SA in the ICC Arbitration.  On 19 May 2016 the Investor confirmed that it had no objection to SA’s appointment as arbitrator. The Investor noted that neither it nor its associated companies had engaged SA in the past. The Investor further stated that, due to SA’s stature as an advocate, it was aware that SA “has been instructed on a regular basis by [[AAA]] as a counsel and … that he has been (and continues to be) instructed by [[DDD]]”. The Investor did not regard those matters as problematic. For their part, the Plaintiffs did not complain that [AAA] had been instructing SA. As for the Firm, it had previously only had two contacts with SA before the ICC Arbitration. In 2003 the Firm engaged SA as an expert for an unrelated arbitration.  In 2012 the Firm, including the lead lawyer (Mr. [N] QC) of the Firm’s team representing the Investor in the ICC Arbitration, had acted against SA in another unrelated arbitration. Prior to the events set out below, the Firm had never acted as co-counsel with SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 31 May 2016 the ICC confirmed the appointments of Mr. [Y] and SA as co-arbitrators. The Chairperson was appointed as presiding arbitrator on 28 July 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 SA circulated that part of the ICC Award drafted by him to the other members of the Tribunal on 5 March 2019. On 22 March 2019 the Tribunal sent a draft of the ICC Award to the ICC for scrutiny. On 18 April 2019 the ICC approved the draft ICC Award with comments. On 25 April 2019 the Tribunal informed the parties that it had revised the draft ICC Award on the basis of the ICC’s comments and had sent the same to the ICC for final approval. The ICC transmitted the finalised ICC Award to the parties on 3 May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 A major area of dispute in the ICC Arbitration was whether the Investor could invoke the clauses 14 and 17 put options at the same time. The Investor maintained throughout the ICC Arbitration that, by clause 28.3 of the SSHA, it was entitled to bring claims under clauses 14 and 17 “in tandem”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 More specifically, the Investor’s Statement of Claim dated 9 February 2017 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">SOC</span>”) in the ICC Arbitration asked in [201] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Investor] be granted, the highest sum of the prayers sought below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">i. direct specific performance of the [Promoter]’s obligation to pay the price set out in Clause 17.2(a) of the [SSHA], being USD 70.5 million;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">ii. in the alternative, direct the [Promoter] to pay to the [Investor] the maximum price permissible under Indian law, being USD 24.86 million, and a further sum of USD 45.6 million as damages / compensation for the [Plaintiffs’] failure to perform their obligations under Clause 17;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iii. in the further alternative, direct the [Promoter] to pay to the [Investor] damages / compensation equivalent to the price set out in Clause 17.2(a) for the [Plaintiffs’] breach of their obligations under Clause 17, being USD 70.5 million;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iv. damages equivalent to the FMV Price, which amounts to USD 24.86 million; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">v.  in the further alternative, direct the [Promoter] to pay to the [Investor] such other sums as the Tribunal thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 By the time of its Post-Hearing Brief dated 24 September 2018, the Investor had refined the relief being sought as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In respect of amounts sought under paragraph 201 of  the SOC, the [Investor] wishes to clarify that the priority of relief requested is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) damages in the amount of the Clause 17.2 price calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.4(d) above (the <span class="font-weight-bold">Relevant Clause 17.2 Price</span>) as compensation for the [Promoter]’s breach of Clause 17.2;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) specific performance of the [Promoter]’s obligation to pay the Relevant Clause 17.2 Price up to the maximum amount permissible under the FEMA [that is, India’s Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999] regime, being the FMV Price of USD 25.88 million, and damages for the remainder of the Relevant Clause 17.2 Price as compensation for the [Plaintiffs’] breach of Clause 17.2;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) specific performance enforcing the [Promoter]’s obligation to pay the Relevant Clause 17.2 Price;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) damages of USD 25.88 million (being the FMV Price) as compensation for the [Promoter]’s breach of Clause 14.2; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) in the alternative, directions to the [Promoter] to pay to the [Investor] such other sums as the Tribunal sees fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Investor repeatedly stressed, as the Tribunal put it in the ICC Award, that “it does not seek double recovery, and it has only sought recovery of the highest amount available”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Plaintiffs’ case, on the other hand, was summarised by the Tribunal in the ICC Award as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n their Post-hearing Brief, at paras 338-340, the [Plaintiffs] repeat their pleaded submission, contending that to pursue rights under clauses 14 and 17 in tandem is absurd and cannot be accepted – "the [Investor] cannot sell the same shares twice by altering the nature of the reliefs." The [Plaintiffs’] argument is that clause 28.3 does not envisage the simultaneous exercise of inconsistent rights, there is a risk of unjust enrichment, and the [Investor] "cannot be allowed to assert claims under both clauses 14 and 17 of the [SSHA] in the same proceedings.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The ICC Award concluded that, so long as there was no double recovery, the Investor was entitled by reason of clause 28.3 to assert claims under both clauses 14 and 17 of the SSHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 During the ICC Arbitration, the Plaintiffs contended that SSHA clause 17.2 was contrary to the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (Act 42 of 1999) (India) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">FEMA</span>”), FEMA-related regulations, and Reserve Bank of India (“<span class="font-weight-bold">RBI</span>”) circulars. They argued that an award pursuant to clause 17 was thus unenforceable under Indian law in the absence of RBI approval and such approval would never be given because clause 17 stipulated for a guaranteed return.  The Plaintiffs also suggested that clause 17 operated as a penalty and was unenforceable under Indian law for that reason as well. However, the ICC Award held that FEMA did not render an award under clause 17 unenforceable and rejected the characterization of clause 17 as a penalty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The ICC Award assessed the FMV of the shares in the Company under clause 14 at INR 160.2 crores. The ICC Award noted that, as agreed by the parties, the Investor’s original investment in the Development had been INR 800 million (that is, INR 80 crores).  Accordingly, based on a 25% IRR, the ICC Award calculated the total due to the Investor under clause 17 to be INR 761 crores as at 31 March 2019. In the dispositive section to the ICC Award, the Tribunal consequently directed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) [The Promoter] is ordered, by way of specific performance, to pay to [the Investor] within 28 days of this Award, the sum of INR 761 crores pursuant to clause 17.2 of the [SSHA], as at March 31, 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The Tribunal orders, by way of specific performance, [the Promoter] to pay to [the Investor] within 28 days of this Award a further sum pursuant to clause 17.2 of the [SSHA], being 25% IRR to the date of this Award in an amount to be agreed between the parties, or, failing agreement, to be determined by the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Upon payment of the sums in (1) and (2) above, [the Investor] shall deliver to [the Promoter] executed transfers and any other title documents relating to its shares in [the Company].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  If for any reason the awards in (1) and/or (2) above are declared unenforceable in whole or in part by any court or tribunal, [the Promoter] shall pay to [the Investor] the sum of INR 160.2 crores pursuant to clause 14.2 of [the SSHA] (or such lesser sum as shall be sufficient to satisfy the awards in (1) and (2) above, after taking account of any amounts paid by [the Promoter] pursuant thereto) upon delivery by [the Investor] to [the Promoter] of executed transfers and any other title documents relating to its shares in [the Company].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  [The Investor]’s claim for currency losses is reserved to a future award.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) Interest on the sums awarded is reserved to a future award.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(7)  [The Plaintiffs] are ordered, for so long as [the Investor] holds its shareholding in [the Company], not to hold any Board Meetings or meetings of [the Company], or passing any resolutions thereat, otherwise than in compliance with clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the [SSHA].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(8)  [The Investor]’s claims for breach of the arbitration agreement in relation to the actions of [the Plaintiffs] ... are reserved to a future award.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9)  Costs are reserved to a future award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Tribunal having reserved some matters for later decision, the ICC Arbitration remains ongoing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 9 March 2019, while attending the wedding of the son of the chairperson and CEO of [MMM] Ltd, SA was approached to act for [MMM] at a Delhi High Court hearing on 13 March 2019 relating to the enforcement of an UNCITRAL Award (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">UNCITRAL Award</span>”) in favour of [MMM] and company [NNN] against the Indian government.  Instructions from [MMM] followed. The dispute (the<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>“<span class="font-weight-bold">UNCITRAL</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Arbitration</span>”) giving rise to the UNCITRAL Award is unconnected with the ICC Arbitration.  But the Firm were (and are) widely known to be acting for [MMM]/[NNN] in connection with the obtaining of the UNCITRAL Award and its enforcement. The Firm’s team representing [MMM]/[NNN] is led by Ms. [P]. She has not been (and is not) involved in the ICC Arbitration.  But Mr. [N] is (and has been) a prominent member of the Firm’s team acting in the UNCITRAL Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the week of 10 March 2019, SA attended three meetings relating to the Delhi High Court hearing. Ms. [P] was present at one meeting along with an associate of the Firm who has not been involved with the ICC Arbitration.  Mr. [N] was not at any of the three meetings. SA was apparently unaware that Ms. [P] was from the Firm until later. On 13 March 2019 SA appeared before the Delhi High Court in the enforcement proceedings. The hearing lasted for some ten minutes and led to an adjournment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Thereafter, [MMM] approached SA about his potential engagement as counsel in the UNCITRAL Arbitration. Negotiations ensued. In early May 2019 SA met with [MMM]’s legal team. Ms. [P], together with an associate from the Firm who was not involved in the ICC Arbitration, attended for the Firm. On 16 May 2019, Mr. [N] and Ms. [P] met SA for about an hour. SA has described the meeting as a “courtesy call”.  On 27 May 2019 there was another hearing before the Delhi High Court. SA was not instructed for this hearing.  In early June 2019 it was agreed in principle that SA would act with the Firm in the UNCITRAL Arbitration. The clerk to SA’s London chambers had discussions with [MMM]/[NNN] on the terms of such engagement. On 10 June 2019 Mr. [N] and Ms. [P] again met with SA for about an hour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 14 June 2019 the Investor filed submissions on the ongoing matters in the ICC Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On 17 June 2019 SA emailed the parties to the ICC Arbitration as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I write to disclose, purely for the sake of transparency, that earlier this year I was instructed by an Indian law firm in connection with the enforcement in the Delhi High Court of an interim award in a dispute between the Government of India and [[MMM]/[NNN]].

It is unfortunate that the [Plaintiffs] have now chosen to suggest that the test of bias to be adopted should be that applied by U.S. Courts to “co-counsel”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34)35)  One of the areas of likelihood of bias is when the law firm of one of the parties is a client of the Arbitrator.

The reason is obvious for any such rule that opens an arbitrator’s appointment to challenge merely on being a co-counsel with one of the parties counsels, without more and without reference to the nature and kind of practice in the jurisdiction where the arbitrator practices law, would perhaps be overbroad. Paragraph 3.3.9 of the Orange List deals with relationships between arbitrators and counsel. It requires a disclosure of a relationship of an arbitrator and the lawyer of another party as <span class="font-italic">co</span><span class="font-italic"> counsel</span>. The application of this requirement will have to be evaluated in the context of the nature of the practice in India and in the UK. The fact that it requires disclosure does not in all events suggest that in all such cases there is likely hood [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] of impairment of independence or impartiality.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42)43)  I did not consider that my involvement in [the UNCITRAL Arbitration] would create a situation that would bring about a relationship with [Mr. [N]] of the kind as could justifiably give rise to doubts about my continuance as an arbitrator in the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43)44) There is a large legal team consisting of lawyers from [the Firm] [lead by Ms. [P]], in-house lawyers of [[NNN]], [lawyers working for [MMM]], who are working on the arbitration and they will be working with me in the arbitration. I do not believe that I would have any continuous interaction with [Mr. [N]] apart from exchanging comments on drafts etc. In any event, this relationship is of a purely professional nature and is a one-off engagement. I have had no occasion in the past to work with [Mr. [N]], though I appeared against him in an arbitration in London. I have no other engagement that would require us working together. Similarly, I have had no other engagement from [the Firm] in the past few years – I was engaged by them once sometime in 2004 [to the best of my recollection] as an expert in Indian law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44)45) Thus, I formed the view that it did not create a situation in which I should decline to continue further in the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45)46) I do consider it a matter of grave regret that the [Plaintiffs], who appointed me, do not now have any faith in my independence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46)47) I have no real desire to continue in these proceedings, and personally feel disinclined to continue as an arbitrator even if a party, without sufficient reason, doubts my independence. The only reason why I have, after considerable reflection, chosen not to resign is that considering that not much remains to be done in the present arbitration, it may create an unfair situation for the [Investor] and inconvenience to my colleagues if a new arbitrator was necessitated on account of my resignation. However, if the ICC has the slightest concern about my continuance, I would willingly resign from this arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On 2 August 2019 the Plaintiffs applied to the Singapore Court to set aside the ICC Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On 10 August 2019 SA commented further on the ICC Challenge:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1)  I have gone through the [Investor’s] response to the challenge.

I am honoured that my fellow arbitrators have reposed their continuing faith in my independence.

First, they submit that the ICC Award was neither final nor complete in that it entirely failed to resolve the parties’ dispute. The Tribunal instead left it to a supervising or enforcing court to determine the amount (if any) due to the Investor from the Promoter for the transfer of shares in the Company. Second, the Plaintiffs contend that, by the ICC Award, the Tribunal purported to confer upon itself the power to alter its decision <span class="font-italic">ex post facto, </span>if its order that the Promoter pay the Investor an amount under clause 17 should be set aside or refused enforcement for any reason. The Plaintiffs argue that the Tribunal became <span class="font-italic">functus</span> upon rendering the ICC Award. They suggest that consequently the Tribunal cannot decide the amount due to the Investor afresh if the clause 17 relief awarded proves unenforceable. The Tribunal cannot declare that the clause 14 relief mentioned in the ICC Award should become effective in such case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On their first point, the Plaintiffs say that the relevant questions for the Tribunal to determine were (1) whether the Investor could bring claims under clauses 14 and 17 in tandem and (2) if so, under which claim the Investor was entitled to receive payment. According to the Plaintiffs, having decided that the Investor was entitled to bring claims in tandem and in light of the Investor’s acceptance that it could not have double recovery, the Tribunal had to decide which put option claim to allow. On finding that that the clause 17 put option had been validly exercised and was not void or unenforceable by Indian law, the Tribunal’s duty was finally and completely to allow that claim and that claim alone. If, on the other hand, the Tribunal was of the view (which it was not) that the clause 17 put option was inapposite for any reason, then the Tribunal’s duty was to allow the clause 14 relief and no more. The Plaintiffs object that the Tribunal did neither. They say that the Tribunal instead found in favour of both put options and made the ultimate relief to which the Investor was entitled contingent on the decision of any number of courts or tribunals over an indefinite period as to the enforceability of clause 17.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Plaintiffs observe that the ICC Award can be enforced anywhere in the world, not just in India where the Plaintiffs are based. They thus characterise what the Tribunal did as tantamount to saying: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Investor] is entitled to exercise its put option under Clause 17 provided that all relevant courts and tribunals agree with us but if just one of them does not, then [the Investor] is entitled to exercise its put option under Clause 14 to claim a second sum from the Plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This (the Plaintiffs contend) makes the ICC Award unworkable. More pertinently, it is submitted that, if asked by the Investor to pay the amount due under the ICC Award for the transfer of shares in the Company, the Plaintiffs would have no idea what amount to tender, as the sum would depend upon the ruling of some court or tribunal somewhere as to the enforceability of clause 17. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is further said that, by leaving the final outcome to the determination of another forum, the Tribunal created a circularity. The enforcement of the ICC Award predicates a decision by a supervising or enforcing court that clause 17 is enforceable. Until some such forum has considered the enforceability of clause 17 and so long as there remains the possibility that a forum may declare clause 17 to be unenforceable, the relief granted by the Tribunal under clause 17 remains undetermined. This means that the enforceability of the put option reliefs under clauses 14 and 17 hinges on the view of every potential enforcing or other court or tribunal. Different forums can reach different conclusions on the enforceability of clause 17, with the decision of one forum not necessarily binding another. For example, the undisputed evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs before this court is that a creditor can file multiple applications for the enforcement of an award before different High Courts of different Indian states.  The decision of one Indian High Court would not be binding on another, save possibly for issue estoppel.  Moreover, the RBI may of its own motion challenge the legality of clause 17 under FEMA before a relevant Indian forum. Thus, even if steps to enforce the ICC Award are only taken in India, the position will be the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On their second point, the Plaintiffs posit that, if the Tribunal had only granted relief under clause 17, it would not later be able to re-open its decision if such relief turned out to be unenforceable in the view of a supervising or enforcing court. The Tribunal would be <span class="font-italic">f</span><span class="font-italic">unctus</span> and the Investor could not recover anything.  But here the Tribunal sought to get around its having become <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>by making the ICC Award contingent on what happens before a supervising or enforcing court. The Plaintiffs go so far as to submit that, if a tribunal can use the device employed here to circumvent a relevant court’s refusal of enforcement, that would make a mockery of the principle that, having decided a substantive issue, the tribunal becomes <span class="font-italic">functus</span> in relation to that issue.<span class="font-italic"> </span>It would mean (the Plaintiffs say) that a tribunal could frame its decisions in the alternative to pre-empt the effects of a court’s refusal to enforce any one of the alternative awards. The Plaintiffs stress that it is no part of a tribunal’s role to concern itself with what happens after an award has been issued. A tribunal’s job (the Plaintiffs contend) is instead merely to decide a dispute.  Thereafter, it is for the parties to seek or resist enforcement and for a court to determine whether the award should stand. In this case, the Tribunal exceeded its mandate by having regard to what might happen afterwards.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Plaintiffs conclude from the foregoing arguments that the put option reliefs purportedly awarded by the Tribunal are in excess of jurisdiction and should be set aside under section 3(1) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">IAA</span>”) read with Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Model</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Law</span>”). The Plaintiffs submit in the alternative that the ICC Award should be set aside under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law as being repugnant to the public policy of Singapore, the seat of the ICC Arbitration. It is suggested in the further alternative that the put option reliefs should be set aside under section 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and/or Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. This is because it is alleged that there was a denial of natural justice in that the Plaintiffs were not afforded the opportunity to address the Tribunal on the inappropriateness of the contingent nature of the put option reliefs granted.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I am not persuaded by the Plaintiffs’ points. The Plaintiffs’ two points are in essence the same argument expressed in different ways. I shall therefore deal with the two points together.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 There is nothing incomplete or lacking in finality about the ICC Award insofar as it dealt with clauses 14 and 17. Reading the ICC Award as a whole and in context, the Tribunal made a cumulative award.  The Tribunal plainly thought that the Investor was entitled to be paid a base amount of INR 160.2 crores (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Amount</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 1</span>”), equivalent to the FMV for its shares in the Company pursuant to clause 14. The Tribunal so awarded that amount by sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive of the ICC Award. The Tribunal was clearly also of the opinion that, pursuant to clause 17, on top of Amount 1, the Investor should be paid an additional INR 600.8 crores (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Amount</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 2</span>“) (that is, the difference between INR 761 crores and INR 160.2 crores) with the result that at the end of the day the Investor should receive a grand total of INR 761 crores, representing its investment in the Development plus a 25% IRR until 31 March 2019. The Tribunal consequently awarded the grand total of Amounts 1 and 2 by sub-paragraph (1) of the dispositive section of the ICC Award. The Tribunal additionally noted in sub-paragraph (2) of the dispositive that, pursuant to clause 17, the Investor should be entitled to a further amount (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Amount </span><span class="font-weight-bold">3</span>”) representing an additional 25% IRR for the period from 1 April to 30 April 2019 (the date of the ICC Award). But the Tribunal (as it was entitled to do) postponed the assessment of Amount 3 to a later date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Tribunal obviously regarded INR 761 crores (that is, the total of Amounts 1 and 2) as the maximum amount that the Promoter is liable to pay to the Investor under clauses 14 and 17, taken in tandem, as at 31 March 2019. This is evident from the bracketed words in sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive section of the ICC Award, that is, the words “or such lesser sum as shall be sufficient to satisfy the awards in (1) and (2) above, after taking account of any amounts paid by [the Promoter] pursuant thereto” (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">bracketed words</span>”).  Those words have the effect that in no case can the Investor ever receive more than INR 761 crores out of the ICC Award for the period up to 31 March 2019. The bracketed words were no doubt inserted into sub-paragraph (4) to ensure that there would be no double recovery on the Investor’s part. The award in sub-paragraph (1) of the dispositive in practical effect tops up the quantum of the award in sub-paragraph (4), much as in due course an award quantifying Amount 3 will top up the total amount due to the Investor for the transfer of shares in the Company to the Promoter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Since the ICC Award expressly refers to problems in connection with the enforcement of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the dispositive, the Tribunal was cognisant that the Investor could face difficulties in enforcing those sub-paragraphs of the ICC Award. There is nothing unusual about this. Arbitrators are duty-bound to use their best endeavours to produce an enforceable award. Conscientious arbitrators thus invariably worry about whether their award can be enforced. The proviso to sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive (that is, the words “If for any reason the awards in (1) and/or (2) above are declared unenforceable in whole or in part by any court or tribunal”) (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Proviso</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>does no more than highlight, presumably out of an abundance of caution on the Tribunal’s part, the fact that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the award of INR 761 crores (that is, the total of Amounts 1 and 2) under sub-paragraph (1) of the dispositive and the award of Amount 3 to be assessed under sub-paragraph (2) of the dispositive; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the award of INR 160.2 crores (that is, Amount 1) under sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">are distinct and severable. If the award under sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the dispositive are held for any reason to be unenforceable with the result that the award of the total of Amounts 1, 2 and 3 falls away, the award of Amount 1 under sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive will still remain standing and be enforceable. Contrary to what the Plaintiffs assert, there is nothing strange about this. Arbitrators frequently make awards consisting of a number of component amounts A, B, C, etc. The mere fact that component A is held to be unenforceable for some reason will not mean that components B, C, etc are likewise unenforceable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I do not accept the contention that, until all relevant courts (that is, the totality of courts before which the Investor seeks to enforce the ICC Award) have pronounced as to whether the ICC Award will be enforced, it will not be possible to say how much is due and owing by the Plaintiffs to the Investor.   Nor do I accept that there is anything “circular,” “contingent” or “unworkable” about the ICC Award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To the question, for what amount is the Promoter liable under the ICC Award, the answer is apparent: The Promoter is liable to pay INR 761 crores for the Investor’s shares in the Company. That is the total amount which the Tribunal has held to be due to the Investor from the Promoter as at 31 March 2019.  There remains a sum equivalent to 25% IRR for the period from 1 April 2019 to 30 April 2019 (that is, Amount 3) to be assessed in a later award.  If the Plaintiffs’ complaint is that the ICC Award is “contingent” because the Tribunal sets out alternative orders for the payment of money and fails to make a determination as to which of the two alternatives is to be paid, then for the reasons that I have set out the ICC Award is palpably not of such a nature.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the other hand, if the Plaintiffs are merely saying that the ICC Award is “contingent” because, if the Plaintiffs refuse to honour the same, the recovery by the Investor of the total amount of INR 761 crores awarded for the period up to 31 March 31 2019, depends on the extent to which courts find sub-paragraph (1) of the dispositive to be enforceable, then the Plaintiffs would only be stating a truism characteristic of every award for the payment of money. Such truism can hardly constitute a criticism of the ICC Award or be said to lead to “circularity”. The extent to which a creditor can recover money awarded by a tribunal will self-evidently depend on the degree to which relevant courts hold that the award is enforceable. This must especially be the case where a money award consists of components, such as a component for the payment of principal and a component for the payment of interest. Some courts may refuse to enforce one or more components of an award, resulting in a creditor obtaining less than the total sum awarded or anything at all. A creditor cannot be 100% certain of obtaining all of its entitlement (such as here the amount of INR 761 crores) until the relevant award is recognised and enforced by relevant courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 There are in fact only minor differences between the ICC Award and a routine award for (say) the payment by a debtor of a principal sum and an interest component. These minor differences are the consequence of two features which the Tribunal had to cater for in the dispositive of the ICC Award. The first feature was the overlap between the amount of INR 160.2 crores awarded under clause 14 and the amount of INR 761 crores awarded under clause 17. If those two amounts had simply been compounded together and the total so obtained awarded, there would be double recovery. The Tribunal therefore dealt with the first feature by including the Proviso and the bracketed words in sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive. The second feature was that, by the express terms of clauses 14 and 17, full payment by the Promoter of the amount due under one or other clause triggers an obligation on the Investor’s part to transfer its shares in the Company to the Promoter. The Tribunal dealt with this feature, as far as the transfer following payment under clause 17 was concerned, by sub-paragraph (3) of the dispositive and, as far as the transfer following payment under clause 14 was concerned, by including the Proviso, the bracketed words, and the final words (that is, the words “upon delivery by [the Investor] to [the Promoter] of executed transfers and any other title documents relating to its shares in [the Company]”) in sub-paragraph (4) of the dispositive.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The two features just identified and the pragmatic manner by which the Tribunal handled them do not have the result of making the ICC Award something that is unconventional, indeterminate or impermissible. The dispositive of the ICC Award took what might appear at first blush to be a convoluted form, not because the Tribunal was arrogating to itself the power to alter its decision depending upon post-award events, but purely because of the way in which clauses 14 and 17 were drafted. Contrary to what has been suggested by the Plaintiffs, the ICC Award is not an attempt to subvert the principle that a tribunal is <span class="font-italic">functus</span> once it has decided a matter.  On the contrary, it would be odd if the ICC Award is to be characterised as going beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or against Singapore public policy, just because the Tribunal tailored the dispositive of the ICC Award (as it was bound to do) to the terms of the SSHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It follows from the foregoing that there is no basis for setting aside the ICC Award under Articles 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) or 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the Model Law.  Nor is there a basis for setting aside the ICC Award under IAA section 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law due to an alleged lack of due process.  The reality is that the Plaintiffs had ample opportunity to make (and did make) submissions on the matter.  As noted above at [9] above, right up to the time of closing submissions, it was hotly disputed by the Plaintiffs whether the Investor could claim clause 14 and clause 17 reliefs in tandem and whether the Tribunal could make a cumulative award on both clauses without triggering double recovery. Referring to SSHA clause 28.3, the Tribunal held that it could make such a cumulative award and did so. The Plaintiffs are essentially complaining here that the Tribunal has done by the ICC Award that which, during the ICC Arbitration, the Plaintiffs contended was “ludicrous”, “absurd”, and impossible to do. The Plaintiffs’ critique in the present setting aside application is a reiteration of its contention during the ICC Arbitration that the Tribunal could not make a cumulative award under clauses 14 and 17 without bringing about double recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The put option ground accordingly fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The bias ground</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The ICC Arbitration was conducted pursuant to the 2012 ICC Rules of Arbitration (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">ICC Rules</span>“).

His original comments did not refer to paragraph 3.3.9, but proceeded on the erroneous basis that the Orange List contained no express statement that a co-counsel relationship should be disclosed. This mistake appears to have been because SA originally referred to the 2004 edition of the <span class="font-italic">IBA Guidelines</span> which lacked a similar provision to paragraph 3.3.9.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 There was little (if any) difference between the parties on how, as a matter of law, the existence or otherwise of apparent bias is to be determined. The test for apparent bias in arbitration proceedings is analogous to that applicable in court proceedings, namely, a test of reasonable suspicion. That test involves an assessment of whether there are circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the tribunal may be biased and that a fair hearing may not be possible as a result: <span class="font-italic">U</span><span class="font-italic">ES Holdings Pte Ltd v KH Foges Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 3 SLR 648 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">UES</span>”) at [29], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Loh J. The test applies to applications to remove an arbitrator for bias under Article 13(3) of the Model Law and applications to set aside an arbitral award for apparent bias under section 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) IAA and Article 34(2) of the Model Law: <span class="font-italic">PT Central </span><span class="font-italic">Investindo v Franciscus Wongso and others and another matter</span> [2014] 4 SLR 978 at [51] and [142], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Ang J.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The reasonable suspicion test is applied objectively: <span class="font-italic">BOI v BOJ</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">BOI</span>”) at [103(b)]. The hypothetical reasonable observer is presumed to be a lay-person who is: (1) informed of the relevant facts and able to consider them in their proper context, (2) not wholly uninformed and uninstructed about the law in general or the issues to be determined in the proceedings,  (3) aware of the traditions of integrity and impartiality that persons who exercise adjudicative functions generally have to uphold, and (4) fair-minded in the sense of being neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious: <span class="font-italic">BOI</span> at [99]–[102]. The Plaintiffs submit (and I am prepared to accept) that, since the <span class="font-italic">IBA Guidelines</span> have achieved widespread acceptance as setting out current international practice for disclosure among arbitrators, the reasonable observer would be aware of the duty of disclosure as set out in the <span class="font-italic">IBA Guidelines</span>. However, the court must be careful, when evaluating whether the reasonable observer would harbour a justifiable suspicion of bias, not to assume knowledge beyond that of a reasonably well-informed member of the public. For instance, the court should not presume a detailed knowledge of law or arbitration practice or inside knowledge of the attributes of tribunal members: <span class="font-italic">BOI</span> at [103(d)]. A reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias arises when the hypothetical reasonable observer would think, from the relevant circumstances, that bias is possible. The belief should not be fanciful and must be capable of articulation by reference to the available evidence. A standard of possibility (as opposed to probability) is adopted to ensure that from the public perspective the administration of justice is beyond reproach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Following the ICC Award, there has not been a substantive decision in the ICC Arbitration. SA having voluntarily resigned from the ICC Arbitration and having now been replaced by Mr. [Z], there is no question of any substantive decision of the Tribunal post-dating the ICC Award being tainted by apparent bias consequent upon SA’s engagement by [MMM]/[NNN].  Thus, the question that I have to focus on here is whether the ICC Award should be set aside for apparent bias by reason of SA’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Plaintiffs submit that, in keeping with the <span class="font-italic">IBA Guidelines</span>, SA should have disclosed as early as 9 March 2019 that he had been approached or engaged to act for [MMM] in a matter in which the Firm were also acting. For the purposes of my analysis, I shall assume in the Plaintiffs’ favour that this is correct. In other words, I shall proceed on the basis that, from the time when he was approached or engaged to act for [MMM] on 9 March 2019, SA fell within the term “co-counsel” in paragraph 3.3.9 and should have made (but did not make) disclosure of that circumstance in accordance with General Standard 3(a) and (d) and paragraph 3.3.9 of the <span class="font-italic">IBA Guidelines</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Plaintiffs say that, on the available evidence, applying the reasonable suspicion test, I should find that there was apparent bias vitiating the ICC Award. The Plaintiffs contend that, had SA made proper disclosure on 9 March 2019, they would have successfully objected to his continuing as arbitrator on the ground of apparent bias with the result that SA would have had to resign from the Tribunal and not have taken part in the ICC Award.  My difficulty with this submission is that I do not see how the nature and extent of SA’s associations with the Firm support a conclusion of apparent bias in relation to the ICC Award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 First, SA is not a partner within the Firm.  Although acting as co-counsel with the Firm, he was acting as an independent barrister and not sharing in the Firm’s profits and risks as a firm of solicitors. Thus, the mere fact of SA being engaged or potentially engaged to act as co-counsel with the Firm would not of itself give rise to apparent bias. For there to be cause for concern, there must be something about SA’s actual contact with the Firm’s representatives that gives rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Second, although SA met with representatives of the Firm (such as Ms. [P] and an associate) prior to the transmittal of the ICC Award to the parties by the ICC on 3 May 2019, those representatives of the Firm that SA met before 3 May 2019 had no involvement with the ICC Arbitration.  Those representatives of the Firm would therefore not have been in a position to discuss anything about the ICC Arbitration with him. It is hard to see how the Firm’s representatives could possibly have influenced SA’s views on the merits of the ICC Arbitration one way or the other. Mr. [N], on the other hand, was certainly involved in the ICC Arbitration. But SA did not meet with him in connection with the UNCITRAL Arbitration until 16 May and 10 June 2019. Both meetings took place well after the ICC Award had been transmitted to the parties. It is thus fanciful to suggest that SA’s views on the merits of the ICC Arbitration, as set out in the ICC Award, could have been influenced in some way (whether consciously or unconsciously) by anything that Mr. [N] said or did at the meetings on 16 May and 10 June 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 At the hearing before me, the Plaintiffs vaguely suggested that SA’s views in the ICC Award could conceivably have been indirectly influenced by the Firm’s representatives (namely, Ms. [P] and a representative) that he met prior to 3 May 2019. But it was never articulated how this might have been possible.  It was also suggested by the Plaintiffs that in mid-March 2019, having already put in a lot of time and work in the ICC Arbitration, SA would not have wanted to resign from the Tribunal until at least after the ICC Award had been published. So (it is said) SA deliberately kept quiet about being approached or engaged to work for [MMM] as co-counsel with the Firm and did not disclose anything until 17 June 2019.  In so conducting himself, SA would (the Plaintiffs argue) have acted in bad faith and as a result there would be justifiable doubt over the fairness of his views as set out in the ICC Award. This reasoning seems to me contrived. In any event, assume that SA consciously refrained from making disclosure prior to 17 June 2019 because he did not wish to be knocked out from the ICC Arbitration by a challenge from the Plaintiffs before the issue of the ICC Award. It is not apparent why such calculation on SA’s part would give rise to a possibility of his being more disposed towards one party (the Investor) as opposed to the other (the Plaintiffs). On the Plaintiffs’ hypothesis, SA’s presumed goal would only have been to remain in the ICC Arbitration until the ICC Award was issued. Accomplishing that objective would not have dictated that he favour one side over the other. So long as he remained on the Tribunal until the ICC Award was issued, SA would be indifferent to the outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the alternative, the Plaintiffs contended that SA’s disclosure and that of Mr. [N] in an affidavit filed in these proceedings had been less than full and frank. It was suggested that for this reason I should draw adverse inferences as to SA’s good faith and as to the possible existence of undisclosed <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> communications between SA and Mr. [N] before their meetings on 16 May and 10 June 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In support of the submission that I could draw adverse inferences from only partial disclosure, the Plaintiffs referred me to the following passage from the judgment of Hamblen LJ in <span class="font-italic">Halliburton Co v Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd and others</span> [2018] 1 WLR 3361 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Halliburton</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74. If a disclosure that ought to have been made has not been made, that will mean that the arbitrator will not have displayed the “badge of impartiality” which he should have done. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed in the <span class="font-italic">Davidson</span><span class="font-italic">’s </span>case 2005 1 SC (HL) 7, the fact of non-disclosure “must inevitably colour the thinking of the observer”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75. Non-disclosure is therefore a factor to be taken into account in considering the issue of apparent bias. An inappropriate response to the suggestion that there should be or should have been disclosure may further colour the thinking of the observer and may fortify or even lead to an overall conclusion of apparent bias—see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Paice</span><span class="font-italic"> v MJ Harding (trading as MJ Harding Contractors) </span>[2015] EWHC 661 (TCC), [2015] 2 All ER (Comm) 1118 and <span class="font-italic">Cofely Ltd v Bingham</span> [2016] 2 All ER (Comm)<span class="font-italic"> </span>129.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76. Non-disclosure of a fact or circumstance which should have been disclosed, but does not in fact, on examination, give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality, cannot, however, in and of itself justify an inference of apparent bias. Something more is required—see, for example, the comments of Lord Mance in <span class="font-italic">Helow</span><span class="font-italic"> v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2008] 1 WLR 2416, para 58.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Plaintiffs then subjected SA’s disclosure to the parties regarding his engagement by [MMM] to a detailed critique.  For example, SA’s email of 17 June 2019 (see [20] above) was queried for not disclosing the specific date on which he was instructed in relation to the Delhi High Court enforcement proceedings, but only revealing that SA had been instructed “earlier this year”.  Complaint was made that SA did not straightaway provide chapter and verse about his contacts with Mr. [N] and the Firm before 17 June 2019. In similar vein, SA’s email of 18 June 2019 (see [22] above) was said to be woefully insufficient because SA coyly referred there to a mere “belief” that the Firm were acting for [NNN] and was “not sure” if the Firm was also acting for [MMM]. SA (the Plaintiffs commented) has not to this day disclosed precisely when he was approached to act as counsel in the UNCITRAL Arbitration. The Plaintiffs observed that, although they had sought disclosure in suitably redacted form of all communications among the Firm, [MMM], [MMM]’s lawyers and SA regarding SA’s engagement by [MMM]/[NNN], the Investor and the Firm have not complied. In connection with SA’s revised comments of 1 August 2019 to the ICC Challenge (see [25] above), the Plaintiffs speculated that SA had amended his original remarks “because one party alerted him to his error”. The Plaintiffs stressed that they had obviously not alerted SA, presumably implying that the alerting party must have been the Investor and the Firm. The Plaintiffs further suggested that SA’s resignation letter (see [28] above) exhibited “a degree of animosity and ill-feeling towards both the Plaintiffs and their lawyers” from which bad faith could be inferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In relation to Mr. [N], my attention was drawn to [62] of his affidavit in these proceedings. That states: “Importantly, I had no <span class="font-italic">material </span>contact with [SA] in relation to [the UNCITRAL Arbitration] prior to the issuance of the [ICC Award] on 30 April 2019” [original emphasis omitted, emphasis added in italics]. The Plaintiffs suggested that Mr. [N] had carefully chosen his words and the use of the word “material” to qualify “contact” must be taken as implying that SA and Mr. [N] had other meetings on undisclosed occasions before 30 April 2019. By similar token, the Plaintiffs said that they were deeply troubled by [45] of Mr. [N]’s affidavit. That reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the absence of a close or any <span class="font-italic">material</span> professional relationship between myself/[the Firm] and [SA], it should not be surprising that I/[the Firm] did <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not</span> have an <span class="font-italic">active </span>role in [SA]’s engagements to act on behalf of [NNN] and [MMM] for (i) the March 2019 Delhi High Court Hearing; and (ii) [the UNCITRAL Arbitration].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in bold and underline, emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiffs complained that no information has been volunteered about any “non-material professional relationship” between Mr. [N] and SA or any “non-active role” played by Mr. [N] or the Firm in SA’s engagement from 9 March 2019 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I am unable to accept the Plaintiffs’ alternative submission.  I am unable to draw the inferences for which they contend. On the contrary, it seems to me that the Plaintiffs are asking me to approach the available evidence in a manner that is unduly sensitive and suspicious. That, according to <span class="font-italic">BOI</span>, is what I should not be doing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 When Mr. [N] deposes that he has had “no material contact” with SA, he should in my view be taken to mean exactly what he is stating, namely, that he has had no contact with SA relevant to these setting aside proceedings. Prior to 30 April 2019 Mr. [N] would obviously have been appearing as counsel before the Tribunal (including SA).  That would have been “contact” with SA, but not a material one for the purposes of determining this setting aside application. It is therefore understandable that Mr. [N] should depose, in the interests of precision, that he had no <span class="font-italic">material</span> contact with SA prior to 30 April 2019.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As to the involvement or otherwise of Mr. [N] and the Firm in engaging SA for [MMM], “having a role” in a matter by definition entails being “active” in bringing that matter about.  It is difficult to see how one can play a “non-active” or “passive” role in attaining some outcome. That would be an oxymoron. Mr. [N]’s statement as to the Firm and he not having had an “active role” may be pleonastic. But I seriously doubt that the expression means anything more than that neither he nor the Firm played a role in SA’s engagement by [MMM]. This is clear from reading other parts of Mr. [N]’s affidavit. See, for example:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 … [The Firm’s] lawyers are <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not</span> involved in instruction of Senior Advocates ...

As previously stated, [[MMM]] made the decision to engage [SA], and also led the discussions leading to [SA]’s provisional acceptance of the engagement in May 2019 “<span class="font-italic">subject to the fees and other terms being agreed</span>”, and [[NNN]]’s in-principle agreement to the engagement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In SA’s case, there would be the inevitable dilemma of how much information he should volunteer in respect of his dealings with [MMM]/[NNN] (including his interactions with the Firm as counsel to [MMM]/[NNN]), given that SA’s dealings with [MMM]/[NNN] and the UNCITRAL Arbitration proceedings are subject to obligations of confidentiality. Individuals in SA’s position may decide to be sparing in their disclosure in the interests of that confidentiality. This is a matter of judgment on the part of the individual concerned. Different persons may reasonably draw the line as to what to disclose and what not to disclose differently. I am unable to say on the facts of this case that SA was unreasonable in the way that he approached the matter.  As I have already mentioned, the suggestion that there was some collusion between the Investor or the Firm and SA underlying SA’s correction of his original response to the ICC Challenge is only speculation, unsupported by any evidence. Nor am I able to read SA’s comments on the ICC Challenge (including those in his resignation letter) as exhibiting animosity (as opposed to regret) towards the Plaintiffs. An arbitrator faced with the choice of resigning or not when one party wishes him or her to go, but the other does not, is in a difficult position. The arbitrator owes duties to both parties and deciding which way one ought to go will not always be straightforward.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 A court must therefore be wary about drawing inferences of bad faith merely because an arbitrator has been laconic in his or her responses to disclosure requests or has expressed personal regret and hurt in a resignation letter. That does not mean that an arbitrator in SA’s position can be economical with the truth and make misleading statements. Helpful guidance on how a court should approach the matter was given by Hamblen LJ in <span class="font-italic">Halliburton </span>at [76] (see [59] above). Loh J expressed a like view in <span class="font-italic">UES</span>, where he stated at [42] that “a failure to disclose will only give rise to apparent bias if there are other circumstances which support such a finding”. Loh J added at [43] of <span class="font-italic">UES</span> that “the nature and extent of a tribunal’s associations is a crucial factor in determining whether the failure to disclose the same supports a reasonable suspicion of bias.”  Here I do not see any “other circumstances” (<span class="font-italic">UES </span>at [42]) or “something more” (<span class="font-italic">Halliburton </span>at [76]) apart from the posited belated disclosure (see [53] above) to support an inference of apparent bias. For the reasons that I have given, I do not accept that there has been deliberate (or any) insufficient disclosure by SA or Mr. [N]. In particular, I have not found the Plaintiffs’ tendentious reading of what SA and Mr. [N] have written as any basis for inferring bad faith on SA’s or Mr. [N]’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The bias ground accordingly also fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Plaintiffs’ setting aside application is dismissed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Within 14 days of the date of this Judgment, the parties are to submit agreed directions for determining the costs (incidence and quantum) of these proceedings.

</em>Originating Summons No 9 of 2019</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>SICC dismisses the plaintiffs’ application to set aside an arbitral award, finding that the tribunal was justified in granting the cumulative relief that it did to the defendant, and that there was no apparent bias on the part of an arbitrator who made a belated disclosure about being engaged as co-counsel with the defendant’s legal representative.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The second plaintiff (“the Company”) was set up by the first plaintiff (“the Promoter”) (collectively, “the Plaintiffs”) as a special purpose vehicle for the construction and operation of a development. The defendant (“the Investor”) entered into an agreement with the Plaintiffs (“the Agreement”) for the Investor to buy 35% of the Company’s shares. Under cl 14 of the Agreement, if the Promoter failed to undertake an IPO of the Company, the Promoter was obliged to buy the Investor’s shares in the Company at Fair Market Value. Under cl 17 of the Agreement, upon other breaches of the Agreement, the Promoter was obliged to buy the Investor’s shares in the Company at a premium. Under cl 28.3 of the Agreement, the rights of the parties under cll 14 and 17 were “independent” and “cumulative”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>There were various delays to the development, causing the Plaintiffs to be in breach of the Agreement. The Investor commenced arbitration against the Plaintiffs before the International Chamber of Commerce (“the ICC Arbitration”), seeking relief pursuant to cll 14 and 17 of the Agreement “in tandem”. The tribunal released a partial award (“the Award”) in April 2019. The Award directed the Promoter to pay the Investor cumulative relief under cll 14 and 17 (collectively, “the Reliefs”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3     In June 2019, the arbitrator nominated by the Plaintiffs (“the Arbitrator”) disclosed that back in March, he acted for certain private companies before the Delhi High Court for the enforcement of an arbitral award in favour of these companies against the Indian government. The arbitration giving rise to this award (“the India Arbitration”) was unrelated to the ICC Arbitration. However, the international law firm (“the Firm”) that represented the private companies in the India Arbitration also represented the Investor in the ICC Arbitration. Further, the head lawyer of the Firm’s team representing the Investor (“the Advocate”) was also a prominent member of the Firm’s team representing the private companies in the India Arbitration. In July 2019, the Arbitrator was engaged as counsel for the private companies in the India Arbitration.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The dispute</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4      The Plaintiffs applied to set aside the award on two grounds. First, they argued that the Reliefs were alternative in nature so that the tribunal had in effect failed to decide the dispute before it and improperly conferred upon itself the power to change the Award if the relief granted under cl 17 was later found to be unenforceable. Second, they charged the Arbitrator with making belated and only partial disclosures of his co-counsel relationship with the Firm and the Advocate.  This, they argued, amounted to apparent bias on the part of the Arbitrator and vitiated the Award.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5    On the first ground, the Court found that the tribunal was justified in granting the Reliefs as it did (at <strong>[38]</strong>, <strong>[43]</strong>). The Court observed that the Award was not “contingent” in the sense of being an award in the alternative (at <strong>[41]</strong>–<strong>[42]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6      On the second ground, the Court found that the association between the Arbitrator and the Firm was insufficient to support a finding of apparent bias. The Arbitrator was not a partner within the Firm. While the Arbitrator met with some representatives of the Firm before the issuance of the Award, these representatives had no involvement with the ICC Arbitration. Similarly, the Arbitrator only met the Advocate to discuss matters relating to the India Arbitration after the Award had been issued (at <strong>[55]</strong>–<strong>[57]</strong>).  Further, on the assumption that the Arbitrator’s disclosure had been belated, the Court was unable to infer that the disclosure eventually made was in some way insufficient so as to give rise to reasonable doubts about the Arbitrator’s impartiality (at <strong>[63]</strong>–<strong>[65]</strong>).</span></p>
