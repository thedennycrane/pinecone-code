This ground was, however, not mentioned in the originating summons, affidavits, or written submissions – it was first raised in oral submissions at the hearing of the application. Indeed, the SOGA Issue itself was first raised in those oral submissions, and it then dominated the hearing of this application, with the Buyer’s other reasons for setting-aside receding into the background.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I find that the none of the grounds for setting-aside is established, and that the Buyer has not suffered prejudice from the matters complained of. I thus dismiss the setting-aside application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I deal first with the SOGA Issue, and then with the Buyer’s other reasons for setting-aside (essentially that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The SOGA Issue </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The goods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The goods in question are optical fiber preforms: rods made of synthetic quartz doped with germanium; preforms are used to produce optical fiber, which would then be bundled to form optical fiber cables for sale to end users.

</div> In doing so, however, the tribunal cited s 50(3) of the SOGA at paras 230–231, 234, 254–257, and 258(d) of the award. I set out paras 230–234, 252–258 of the award below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">230. <span class="font-italic">I accept that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the measure of loss under Section 50(3) of the SOGA</span><span class="font-italic"> is the Price of Preforms under the Agreement less the market price of preforms, what </span><span class="font-italic">[the Seller] describes as the Hypothetical Market Price</span>. [The Seller’s]<span class="font-italic"> </span>position is that there is an available market for preforms as a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables, but even if there is no available market, [the Seller] is free to compute what it considers to be the value of those goods to it, including by reference to comparable products. [The Buyer] also submits that there is a market for preforms, but does not agree with either [the Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price or that [the Seller] put forward its own evidence of market price. I accept both Parties’ common position that there is an available market for preforms. I do not find it helpful to go by [the Seller’s] alternative argument that [the Seller] is free to compute what it considers to be the value of those goods to it, given the lack of information and evidence on what this might be. The case cited by [the Seller], <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span>, is a case where the High Court found that there was a market for the goods in question, and used the market price of a comparable product as evidence. I shall return to this case below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">231. Some adjustments have to be made. First, the contract Price for Preforms under the Agreement is the price for preforms manufactured according to the specifications in the Agreement. I accept [the Seller’s] evidence that, once the preforms are manufactured for [the Buyer], they are customised for [the Seller’s] requirements. They were specially designed by [the Seller] for [the Buyer] and can no longer be considered generic, once they are manufactured. However, where they have not been manufactured for [the Buyer], the raw materials can be made into preforms to meet any customer’s requirements. In that sense, [the Seller] says, there is a market for preforms generally. I quote [the Seller’s] explanation in the Claimant’s Closing Submissions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">176. [The Seller’s] position is that there is an “available market” for preforms as a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables, such that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">section </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">50(3) of the SOGA applies</span><span class="font-italic"> in determining </span><span class="font-italic">[the Seller’s]</span> <span class="font-italic">measure of damages</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">183. [The Seller’s] position stated at paragraph 176 above (i.e. that there is an “available market”), however, does not mean that the preforms of the type and specifications that [the Seller] supplies to [the Buyer] are “generic”. This is because while the raw materials used to produce preforms are “generic” (i.e. silicon dioxide and germanium dioxide), as explained in Mr. [X]’s evidence, [the Seller] produces preforms specifically customised to suit each customer’s drawing apparatus and conditions, and requirements in terms of optical characteristics. Consequently, any adjustment to a single feature such as length, outer diameter or Mode Field Diameter would mean that a particular preform can be used by one customer but not another.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">232. Secondly, there is no data about market preform prices. Mr [X] testified that there is no “market price” for the Preforms to be supplied to [the Buyer] because these are tailor-made. [The Seller] submits that the Tribunal should take the spot market price for spot optical fiber because contracts for preforms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and kept confidential:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">186. [The Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price approach is entirely consistent with the factual circumstances relevant to the preform and optical fiber market. Preforms are products that only a small number of companies worldwide are able to produce, and which can only be used for the purpose of producing optical fiber and fiber cable. Therefore, [the Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price approach is the reasonable method for computing damages arising from [the Buyer’s] breach of contract. In addition, contracts for preform supply and purchase are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and kept strictly confidential, including prices of preform under long-term, short-term or spot basis contracts. For this reason, even in the [business analysis] reports, there are no data about the preform prices while the spot fiber prices are reported.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">233. [The Seller] submits that optical fiber is the most appropriate comparable product to preform given that optical fiber is, in fact, the final product melted down and drawn from preform. The market price of optical fiber is the closest and most direct evidence of the price of preform sold on a spot basis in any given time.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">234. I accept that it is in principle permissible to look at the market price of comparable products where there is no market price for the specific goods in question. As cited by [the Seller], the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution</span><span class="font-italic"> (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> relied on evidence of the market price of 3800 NAR coal “as the closest and most direct evidence of the market price of 3400 NAR coal” <span class="font-italic">in awarding</span><span class="font-italic"> damages for non-acceptance of a shipment of 3400 NAR coal </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">under Section 50(3) of the</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> SOGA</span><span class="font-italic"> because there was no available market for 3400 NAR coal.</span> In that case, both experts were agreed that coal with a calorific value of 3400 NAR was treated as the commercial equivalent of coal with a calorific value of 3800 GAR. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">252. By PO No. 4, [the Seller] had been ordered to produce any communications between [the Seller] and its customers and prospective customers in relation to the [Preforms] which had not been accepted by [the Buyer], if any such communications exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">253. [The Seller] did not produce any such communications. Mr [X] testified that for the period from February to December 2019, [the Seller’s] customers could only purchase what they were already bound by contract to purchase. They were unable to purchase any more preforms and [The Seller] was unable to sell any additional volume for this period of time. The market situation was such that [the Seller’s] customers could not purchase any additional volume. Mr [X] further testified that the supply that [the Seller] made to its customer in [Country A] was based on a long-term agreement. [the Seller] was unable to acquire any new customers during this period of time. [The Buyer] submits that Mr [X]’s statement that [the Seller] was unable to convince its customers to buy additional volume is unsubstantiated and [the Seller] took no possible measures to mitigate and reduce the quantum of damages.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">254. [The Seller’s] failure to produce communications in which it tried to find buyers for preforms during the relevant period means that it cannot prove the efforts that it took to find buyers. <span class="font-italic">This does not mean that </span><span class="font-italic">its </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">fails or has to be reduced. I accept [the Seller’s]</span> <span class="font-italic">submission that the principle of mitigation is</span><span class="font-italic"> already assumed within the measure of loss in Section 50(3) of the SOGA.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">255. Benjamin’s Sale of Goods (10th Edition) says as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The normal rule stated in s.50(3)</span><span class="font-italic"> incorporates the common law established before</span><span class="font-italic"> the Act</span>, viz. when the buyer fails both to pay the price and to accept the goods, the seller’s damages are calculated by deducting from the contract price the market price at the time and place fixed by the contract for acceptance. The rationale of the statutory provisions is to provide a straightforward and readily applicable measure of damages which will enable the innocent party to be put into the same financial position as it would have been in had the contract been performed and which does not depend upon the action actually taken by the innocent party ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The doctrine of mitigation is one of the bases of this principle </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[i.e. section 50(3)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">]</span><span class="font-italic">:</span> it is assumed that with this additional amount of money [i.e. damages] the seller could, by selling in the market at the current price, put himself into the same financial position he would have been in had the contract been performed according to its terms.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">256. At footnote 531, Benjamin cited the following authorities:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">But </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> s.50(3) of the 1979 Act applies</span><span class="font-italic">, the claimant need not satisf</span><span class="font-italic">y the requirements of reasonable mitigation:</span> <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc v Maclaine Watson &amp;</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd (No. 2)</span> [1990] 3 All E.R. 723 at 726.

These authorities make sense. The starting point for [the Seller’s] loss is that it has not been paid the contract price. One starts with that whole contract price. But if [the Seller] does what is reasonable, it will try to find alternative buyers for the preforms. That is the mitigation aspect. <span class="font-italic">Whether or not it in fact finds alternative buyers, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 50(3) of the</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> SOGA</span><span class="font-italic"> assumes that it would have done so and procured alternative buyers at the market</span><span class="font-italic"> price during the relevant period</span>. Therefore, instead of being able to claim the entire contract price, [the Seller] can only claim the difference between the contract price and the market price, whether or not it has actually managed to sell the preform at the market price. <span class="font-italic">Based on authorities and logic, there has already been an assumption of mitigation</span><span class="font-italic"> built into </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the measure of loss in Section 50(3) of the SOGA</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">and it is inappropriate to</span><span class="font-italic"> make any further deductions from [the Seller’s]</span> <span class="font-italic">computation of loss under that section</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">258.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 These were the points the Seller had raised in its pleadings and evidence, to contend that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement, and so s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply, for there was no “available market for the goods in question”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The tribunal’s findings are thus to the effect that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement, but that there was an available market for “preforms as a class of goods”. It should follow from that, that the tribunal accepted the Seller’s pleaded position that s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply, and rejected the Buyer’s pleaded position that it applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Buyer however points to para 254 of the award, where the tribunal referred to the Seller’s “<span class="font-italic">claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>; and to para 231 of the award which quotes para 176 of the Seller’s written closing submissions: “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies in determining [the Seller’s] measure of damages”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Nevertheless, the <span class="font-italic">first</span> reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA in the relevant section of the award, is in para 130 where the tribunal referred to “the <span class="font-italic">measure of loss</span> under s 50(3) of the SOGA” [emphasis added], which the tribunal accepted was the price of Preforms under the Agreement less the Hypothetical Market Price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Seller had put forward that measure of damages pursuant to s 50(2) of the SOGA, not s 50(3), all the while maintaining that s 50(3) did not apply as there was no available market for the Preforms. Indeed, the very contention that there was no available market for the Preforms led to the Seller coming up with the Hypothetical Market Price using the price of a comparable product – optical fiber.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The <span class="font-italic">second</span> reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA, in para 231 of the award, is in similar vein. There, the tribunal quoted para 176 of the Seller’s written closing submissions in conjunction with para 183 of the same submissions (which explains the reference in para 176 to there being “an ‘available market’ for preforms as a class of goods”). Paragraph 183 of those submissions stated that the Seller maintained that the Preforms under the Agreement were not generic, although the raw materials used to produce them were generic. There was an “available market” for preforms as a class of goods, but no “available market” for the Preforms under the Agreement. Thus explained, the Seller’s para 176 submission was not a contention that s 50(3) applies in the sense of there being an available market for the Preforms under the Agreement – it was a contention that the Seller could use a measure of damages like that under s 50(3), but substituting the Hypothetical Market Price for the market price of the Preforms (for there was neither a market, nor a market price for the Preforms).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The <span class="font-italic">third</span> reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA was in para 234 of the award, where the tribunal cited <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span>”) as a case in which damages were awarded “under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. Indeed, damages were awarded under s 50(3) in <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span>, for the court found at para 128 of the judgment there <span class="font-italic">was</span> an available market for the goods in question (3400 NAR coal), stating: “In my view, there was an available market for the three cargoes at the relevant time.” In that case, although there was an <span class="font-italic">available market</span> for 3400 NAR coal, there were no transactions for that grade of coal from which directly to derive its <span class="font-italic">market price</span> – thus the court derived that from the price of a comparable product (3800 GAR coal).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The tribunal did say in para 234 of the award that <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span> was a case where there was “no available market”; however, earlier at para 230 of the award the tribunal said that in <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span> “the High Court had found that <span class="font-italic">there was a market</span> for the goods in question” [emphasis added] (as indeed the court had). I resolve this inconsistency by regarding the reference in para 234 to “no available market” as an aberration; possibly the tribunal meant “no available market price” and simply omitted the word “price”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It is only the <span class="font-italic">fourth</span> reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA, in para 254 of the award, that mentions the Seller’s “claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. Given the preceding references, though, I regard that as merely short form for the measure of damages put forward by the Seller, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, contract price less Hypothetical Market Price. The tribunal was not saying that s 50(3) of the SOGA applies (for which there needed to be an available market for the good in question) – he had agreed with the Seller that there was no available market for those goods, namely the Preforms under the Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The <span class="font-italic">fifth to seventh</span> references to s 50(3) of the SOGA are in paras 255–256 of the award, where the tribunal referred to <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span> (Michael Bridge gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span>”) for its commentary on mitigation in the context of the <span class="font-italic">measure of damages</span> under s 50(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In similar vein are the <span class="font-italic">eight</span><span class="font-italic">h and ninth</span> references to s 50(3) of the SOGA – in para 257 of the award, where the tribunal reasoned that an assumption of mitigation is built into “the <span class="font-italic">measure of loss</span> in Section 50(3) of the SOGA”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The <span class="font-italic">tenth and final</span> reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA is in para 258(d) of the award, where the tribunal stated, “[the Seller’s] damages should not be reduced by reason of any failure to mitigate, as this is not required under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. That follows on from the discussion in paras 255–257: the tribunal was referring to the <span class="font-italic">measure of damages</span> it was awarding in the present case, namely contract price less Hypothetical Market Price, which it reasoned (with reference to <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span>) had an assumption of mitigation built into it, as did the measure of damages under s 50(3).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did the tribunal award damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA, or under s 50(2)?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 There are indeed infelicitous references to s 50(3) of the SOGA in the award: “the measure of loss under Section 50(3) of the SOGA” in para 230; “no available market” (in relation to <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span>) in para 234; and “claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA” in para 254. On the whole, however, it is clear that the tribunal accepted the Seller’s proposed measure of loss (contract price less Hypothetical Market Price) while also accepting the Seller’s contention that there was no available market for the goods in question (the Preforms under the Agreement), and so s 50(3) did not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This is not a case where the tribunal found s 50(3) of the SOGA applicable and so awarded damages under it. On the contrary, the tribunal found s 50(3) inapplicable. The tribunal then used an analogous measure: contract price less Hypothetical Market Price (not contract price less current or market price, as stipulated in s 50(3)). That the tribunal awarded damages under s 50(2) is reinforced by para 258 (a) of the award: “[The Seller] has suffered loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptance of the shipments”. That is the general measure of damages under s 50(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Seller had contended that those damages could be reckoned by way of the difference between contract price and Hypothetical Market Price, and the tribunal accepted that. That specific measure of damages was fully canvassed between the parties, as was the related issue of whether the goods under the contract were generic or there was an available market for them. Based on my reading of the award in the context of the pleadings, evidence and submissions, there was no breach of natural justice, or excess of jurisdiction. I nevertheless analyse these grounds more fully below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is setting-aside warranted?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inability to present one’s case, and breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Buyer contends that it was unable to present its case, and there was a breach of the rules of natural justice in connection with the making of the award, in that the tribunal awarded damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA when the Seller had not advanced such a claim (at least not prior to its written closing submissions where it asserted at para 176 that “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, the Buyer had a full, fair, and reasonable opportunity of presenting its case in relation to the Seller’s proposed <span class="font-italic">measure of damages</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the difference between the contract price of the Preforms, and the Hypothetical Market Price. In particular, the Buyer submitted a reply witness statement of its expert Mr [Y] who criticised the Seller’s damages claim.

Counsel argued that this was alright, for the Seller had allegedly departed from its pleaded case from as early as Mr [X]’s first witness statement. The contention was that the Seller had, since then, claimed directly under s 50(3), and so an award under s 50(3) was unobjectionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As noted above at [21]–[22], Mr [X]’s first witness statement did not go so far as to assert a claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA. On the contrary, Mr [X] continued to maintain that the Preforms under the Agreement were tailor-made, difficult to sell to any other party, and so there was no “market price” of the Preforms to speak of. His reference to s 50(3) of the SOGA was only to explain why the Seller considered the difference between the hypothetical “market” price and the contract price to be “an indicator of damages incurred”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Mr [X]’s witness statements were followed by the oral opening and closing submissions of the Seller’s counsel, where counsel explained that the Seller was not making a claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA (which it had pleaded did not apply); rather, it was claiming under s 50(2) of the SOGA but using an approach similar to that under s 50(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Notwithstanding the wording in the Seller’s written closing submissions saying that s 50(3) of the SOGA “applies” (see para 176 of those submissions), the Seller had explained at para 183 that it maintained that there was no available market for the goods in question, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Preforms under the Agreement – and accordingly s 50(3) did not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In his oral submissions, the Seller’s counsel contended that it was entitled to advance, and the tribunal to award, a claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA, relying on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">CDM and another v CDP</span> [2021] 2 SLR 235 (“<span class="font-italic">CDM v CDP</span>”), where the court stated at [1] that the notice of arbitration and the statement of claim do not exhaustively define the jurisdiction of the tribunal.

As the court in <span class="font-italic">CAJ v CAI</span> explained (at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [in <span class="font-italic">AKN v ALC</span>] <span class="font-italic">damages had already been pleaded; the loss of a chance analysis was merely a measure of the pleaded claim</span><span class="font-underline"> </span><span class="font-italic">for damages</span>. As such, the loss of a chance analysis fell within the scope of the submission to arbitration and the tribunal’s decision on it had not been made in excess of jurisdiction. The hypothetical we raised thereafter was simply to illustrate<span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> </span>the point that, since the loss of a chance analysis fell within the scope of the submission to arbitration, the objections raised by the appellants went towards the question of breach of natural justice rather than excess of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 From the start of the present arbitration the Seller had asserted a <span class="font-italic">claim for damages</span> for the Seller’s non-acceptance of the goods. Since Mr [X]’s first witness statement, the Seller had put forward the specific <span class="font-italic">measure of damages</span> which the tribunal eventually accepted, namely, contract price less Hypothetical Market Price. That measure of damages was within the scope of the submission to arbitration (and in that regard there is no excess of jurisdiction), and the Buyer had a full, fair, and reasonable opportunity to be heard on it (and so there is no breach of natural justice).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I find that the Seller had not departed from its pleaded claim, and that the tribunal had not awarded damages on an unpleaded claim. That position was correctly set out in the Seller’s written submissions for this application (which the Seller then sought to disavow). That was one of the ironies of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Another irony is that the Buyer complained that the tribunal found that s 50(3) of the SOGA applied, which is what the Buyer itself had argued. The ultimate outcome, though, was not what the Buyer had contended for, namely, that the Seller’s damages should be minimal, or nothing at all; instead, the tribunal awarded substantial damages based on the difference between the contract price, and the Hypothetical Market Price. The fact that the Buyer had invoked s 50(3) in its defence does not make it right for the Seller to belatedly claim under that sub-section, when the Seller had specifically asserted that s 50(3) did not apply. I find, however, that the Seller did not belatedly advance a s 50(3) claim; it had consistently claimed under s 50(2), not s 50(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 If, however, the Seller’s written closing submissions should be interpreted as advancing a claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA, and the award should be interpreted as granting that claim, there would still be no breach of natural justice: whether or not s 50(3) applied was at all material times an issue before the tribunal, which the parties addressed. Moreover, the specific measure of damages put forward by the Seller: contract price less Hypothetical Market Price was set out in Mr [X]’s first written statement, and was fully canvassed by the parties thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is also instructive to consider how the parties reacted contemporaneously. In <span class="font-italic">China Machine New Energy Corp v Jaguar Energy Guatemala LLC and another </span>[2020] 1 SLR 695<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">CNMC</span>”), the Court of Appeal stated that in evaluating the tribunal’s conduct of the proceedings, a court should ask itself if the tribunal’s conduct falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done (at [98]). On a related note, the alleged unfairness upon which the complaining party seeks to found its claim of breach of natural justice must have been brought to the attention of the tribunal (at [102] and [104(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In its oral submissions in this application, the Buyer raised the SOGA Issue and criticised the Seller’s para 176 submission as an unpleaded claim; the Buyer argued that that submission was quoted by the tribunal at para 231 of the award, leading to an award allegedly on the said unpleaded claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Contemporaneously, however, the Buyer never said this about the Seller’s para 176 submission: the Buyer’s rebuttal submissions simply replied substantively to that and other parts of those submissions. If the language of the Seller’s para 176 submission was loose in saying s 50(3) “applies”, so too was para 212 of the Buyer’s written closing submissions in saying that the Seller had sought “damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 This can be contrasted with how the aggrieved party behaved in <span class="font-italic">CAJ v CAI</span>: there the respondent had objected to the appellant’s raising of the “EOT Defence” (which was unpleaded and raised for the first time in its written closing submissions): see [9] and [64]–[68]. That objection was taken in the respondent’s written closing submissions, in response to the appellant’s written closing submissions. The equivalent in the present case would be, the Buyer objecting in its rebuttal submissions to a “s 50(3) claim” being put forward – but there was no such objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Furthermore, the SOGA Issue was not even raised in the Buyers’ present originating summons, affidavits, or written submissions – it was first raised in oral submissions at the hearing (more than five months after the setting-aside application was filed). This suggests that when the Buyer received the award, it did not feel aggrieved about the tribunal’s various references to s 50(3) in the Award; only at some later point did those coalesce into the SOGA Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In any event, to justify setting-aside under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA the rights of the Buyer must have been prejudiced by the breach of natural justice. There is no such prejudice here. Had the tribunal proceeded under s 50(2) of the SOGA as the Seller had earlier advocated, given the findings in the award the tribunal would still have arrived at the same measure of damages: contract price less Hypothetical Market Price. It is difficult to imagine what further submissions the Buyer could have made in response to a s 50(3) claim for the same measure of damages, that it had not already made to the tribunal. Any such further submissions could not reasonably have made a difference to the outcome: see <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2013] 1 SLR 125 at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Buyer suggests that it was prejudiced because, having proceeded under s 50(3) of the SOGA, the tribunal found that any failure on the Seller’s part in mitigating damage by finding buyers, did not affect the Seller’s damages claim. In this regard, the tribunal accepted the Seller’s submission that the principle of mitigation is already assumed within the measure of loss in s 50(3).

</div>
</div> The tribunal elaborated on this at para 257:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… One starts with that whole contract price. But if [the Seller] does what is reasonable, it will try to find alternative buyers for the preforms. That is the mitigation aspect. Whether or not it in fact finds alternative buyers, Section 50(3) of the SOGA assumes that it would have done so and procured alternative buyers at the market price during the relevant period. Therefore, instead of being able to claim the entire contract price, [the Seller] can only claim the difference between the contract price and the market price, whether or not it has actually managed to sell the preform at the market price. <span class="font-italic">Based on authorities and logic, there has already been an assumption of mitigation built into the measure of loss in Section 50(3) of the SOGA and it is inappropriate to make any further deductions from </span><span class="font-italic">[the Seller’s] computation of loss under that section</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As the tribunal’s views on the relevance of mitigation were based on the measure of loss, it would have made no difference whether the tribunal had arrived at that measure of loss by applying s 50(3) of the SOGA, or by applying s 50(2) but using an approach similar to that under s 50(3). In relation to mitigation, the Buyer has thus not been prejudiced by the tribunal’s application of s 50(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Moreover, in the same written closing submissions in which the Buyer had described the Seller’s claim based on the Hypothetical Market Price as being for “damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA” (see [37]–[38] above), the Buyer had also submitted on the Seller’s alleged failure to mitigate.

</div> As such, the Buyer had the opportunity to address, and did address, mitigation in the context of a claim under s 50(3) (or based on a measure analogous to that under s 50(3)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 While prejudice is not an element of the ground under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law, like it is under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, the absence of prejudice remains a relevant consideration when the court decides whether to set aside an award: <span class="font-italic">CRW Joint Operation v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</span> [2011] 4 SLR 305 at [98]–[100].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I find that the Buyer was not unable to present its case, and there was no breach of natural justice in connection with the making of the award.

As was the case in <span class="font-italic">CDM v CDP</span>, the factual matrix for breach of natural justice (here, in relation to the SOGA Issue) was identical with that for excess of jurisdiction (see <span class="font-italic">CDM v CDP</span> at [16]), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the breach of natural justice alleged by the Buyer (denial of the right to be heard on a s 50(3) claim) required the Tribunal to have exceeded its jurisdiction in awarding damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA. If the claim were before the tribunal and the Buyer had the opportunity to engage with it, there would be no breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Furthermore, although the distinction between ss 50(2) and 50(3) of the SOGA did not feature prominently prior to the hearing of the application, the Buyer <span class="font-italic">had</span> complained about the tribunal failing to consider its contentions in relation to “market price”, “available market”, and “hypothetical market price”, all of which feed into the tribunal’s decision on the measure of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 There was, however, some element of surprise to the Seller, from the introduction of the SOGA Issue and the excess of jurisdiction ground at the hearing before me. Following the hearing, the Seller’s solicitors wrote to seek leave to make further arguments in correspondence (which I allowed, also allowing the Buyer’s solicitors to reply).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In the circumstances, I decided to deal with the SOGA Issue and the excess of jurisdiction ground, on their merits, rather than to exclude them just because they were not mentioned in the originating summons and supporting affidavit. Other cases may well merit stricter treatment in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It follows from my findings in relation to breach of natural justice ([69]–[98] above), that I find that the tribunal had not exceeded its jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 If, however, the tribunal had made an award on an unpleaded claim (contrary to my reading of the award), the claim for damages for non-acceptance was nevertheless always within the scope of the submission to arbitration, and the measure of damages awarded (contract price less Hypothetical Market Price) was the same one that had been before the tribunal since Mr [X]’s first witness statement. Moreover, the parties had canvassed whether s 50(3) applies, or only s 50(2) – in particular, whether the goods in question were generic, or there was an available market for them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In the circumstances, any excess of jurisdiction would not have caused the Buyer prejudice: [93]–[98] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Setting-aside is thus not warranted on this ground either.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Had the tribunal failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The other reasons put forward by the Buyer to justify setting-aside were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the tribunal failed to deal with the Buyer’s objection in respect of the “market price” aspect of the Seller’s damages claim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the tribunal relatedly failed to consider the Seller’s factual evidence and admissions that there was in fact a market for the Preforms under the Agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the tribunal failed to address the fundamental problems with the hypothetical market price, notably that it dealt with data from [Country B], not [Country A].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The common thread is: the Buyer seeks to infer from the award that the tribunal had treated the Buyer’s various objections as withdrawn and/or conceded (see para 80 of the Buyer’s written submissions). The Buyer tries to draw a parallel between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Front Row Investment Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">(Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2010] SGHC 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>”), where the tribunal failed to consider a number of the points pleaded, because it thought the respondent had ceased to rely on them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>, there was an explicit indication that the tribunal had failed to consider the points in question: the tribunal said so. That is not so in the present case. The Buyer relies on an inference from the award, and as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals</span> [2015] 3 SLR 488 at [46], this inference “if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to be <span class="font-italic">clear and virtually inescapable</span>” [emphasis added]: see further <span class="font-italic">CIX v CIY</span> [2021] SGHC 53 at [9]–[15].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In the present case, I find that it is not a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference from the award that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions. Instead, it appeared that the tribunal had considered those contentions, and rejected them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tribunal considered the Buyer’s objection to the “market price” aspect of the Seller’s damages claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Buyer argues that the tribunal failed to deal with its fundamental argument that there was in fact a market for the Preforms under the Agreement (as opposed to preforms generally), and correspondingly, in failing to find that the Seller had failed to prove the applicable market price of that market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 This is not borne out by the award:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Preforms under the Agreement were generic, finding to the contrary at paras 231 and 258(b).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Seller had failed to prove the applicable market price of the Preforms, accepting Mr [X]’s position that there is no “market price” for the Preforms because those were tailor-made: para 237 of the award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Seller’s damages for claim fails in total and its loss might well be zero because it had failed to prove the facts and the evidence necessary to establish its claim. The tribunal accepted the measure of damages advocated by the Seller, namely, the contract price of the Preforms under the Agreement less the market price of preforms (which the Seller described as the Hypothetical Market Price): para 230 of the award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The tribunal noted that the Buyer disagreed with the Seller’s computation of the market price for preforms (at para 227 of the award), but the tribunal accepted the Seller’s computation of damages: paras 249 and 258(f) of the award – in particular, the tribunal accepted that the market price of preforms could be derived by a comparison with the trend of the market price of optical fiber: paras 230–251 of the award. Indeed, the Buyer itself acknowledged that there was a correlation between the price of optical fiber, and the price of preforms: it pleaded that because there was an “astronomical” drop in prices of optical fiber towards the end of 2018, the price of preforms reduced astronomically.

Taking the five points above in turn:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The tribunal found that the Preforms under the Agreement were not generic: they were customised, specially designed for the Buyer, tailor-made, and there was no “market price” for them: paras 231, 237, and 258(b).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) From Mr [X]’s evidence as reviewed by the tribunal at paras 237 and 253 of the award, Mr [X] had not conceded that there was a market for the Preforms under the Agreement. Instead, Mr [X]’s evidence was, in that period there were no enquiries from other buyers; the Seller’s customers could only purchase what they were already bound by contract to purchase, they were unable to purchase any more preforms and the Seller was unable to sell any additional volume; the supply made to the Seller’s customer in [Country A] was based on a long-term agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The tribunal dealt with the PO 4 issue at paras 252–257 and 258(d) of the award. The tribunal noted that by PO 4, the Seller had been ordered to produce any communications between the Seller and its customers and prospective customers in relation to the Preforms which had not been accepted by the Buyer, if those communications existed. The tribunal further noted that the Seller did not produce any such communications. The tribunal commented that the Seller’s failure to produce communications in which it tried to find buyers for preforms during the relevant period means that it cannot prove the efforts that it took to find buyers, but that does not mean that its claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA failed or had to be reduced, for the principle of mitigation was already assumed within the measure of loss in s 50(3) of the SOGA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) At para 227, the Tribunal noted the Buyer’s contention about the Seller not having manufactured Preforms in the relevant period, and not producing evidence that it had offered preforms to its other customers. The Tribunal also noted Mr [X]’s evidence on these aspects: see sub-para (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) above. In the event, the Tribunal accepted the measure of damages advocated by the Seller, based on a Hypothetical Market Price.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) At para 231, the Tribunal drew a distinction between preforms generally (for which the Tribunal found it common ground that there was an available market), and Preforms under the Agreement, for which the Tribunal did not find an available market.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The Buyer also criticises the tribunal for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) failing to consider all the relevant evidence that preform and optical fiber are neither alternatives nor close substitutes, and that optical fiber was not the most appropriate comparable product to preform; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) relying on <span class="font-italic">Avra Commodities</span> as the tribunal did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 On the former, the award however shows that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The tribunal noted the Buyer’s submission that the optical fiber prices relied on by the Seller are not evidence of the market price of preforms for the relevant period (at para 235).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The tribunal noted Mr [X]’s evidence that a strong correlation exists between the market price of optical fiber and the market price of preform, which applies particularly in spot transactions (at para 238).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The tribunal noted Mr [Y]’s evidence agreeing with Mr [X] that there will be a positive correlation between the preform and optical fiber prices particularly in the long run, but that they were not perfectly correlated (at para 244).

I have heard what you say about how the claimant should not rely on the hypothetical spot market price in [Country B] in order to establish the market for [Country A]. So all that part I understood and I have heard you.”

In this regard, the tribunal stated at para 245 of the Award:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In addition, it is [the Buyer’s] contention that the data used by Mr [X], i.e., prices of optical fiber as provided in the [business analysis] Reports, and which include the [Country B] market, as opposed to using the prices of … Preforms that [the Seller] sold to its other [Country A] customers during the period from February to December 2019, are inappropriate. I am not with [the Buyer] on this point because a reasonable reading of the [business analysis] Reports suggests that [Country A] is covered under the “developing world” region in the [business analysis] Reports. The [business analysis] Reports do not provide for a separate region for “Asia Pacific” which includes [Country A], as Counsel for [the Buyer] contended during the cross-examination of Mr [X].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The award and the tribunal’s comments in the course of the hearing, do not show that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions.
