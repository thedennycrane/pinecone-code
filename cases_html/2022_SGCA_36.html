font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Andrew Phang Boon Leong JCA (delivering the judgment of the court):</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 Established in February 1960 amidst an acute housing shortage, the Housing &amp; Development Board (“HDB”) was tasked with the considerable endeavour of providing homes for the rapidly growing population of a newly self-governing state (see Centre for Liveable Cities &amp; HDB, <span class="font-italic">Housing: Turning Squatters into Stakeholders</span> (Cengage Learning Asia Pte Ltd, 2013) at p 5). Today, HDB properties house approximately 80% of Singapore’s population (see HDB, “HDB History and Towns” <https: about-us="" history="" www.hdb.gov.sg=""> (accessed 9 March 2022)). This remarkable feat of national planning has been facilitated over the years by an intricate statutory regime, chiefly comprising successive iterations of the Housing and Development Act and the Land Acquisition Act. These statutes have, in turn, imposed various restrictions and conditions on the rights that private individuals may acquire in HDB property, being as it is property with a rather unique character.</https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 One such restriction is set out in s 51(10) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the HDA”), which provides that “[n]o person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created or arising”. The proper interpretation of this provision and its predecessors has been considered by our courts on numerous occasions. Since the decision of Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> Chui Lian v Neo Liew Eng </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>”), the consistent position adopted in the case law has been that the provision only bars <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>persons from becoming entitled to any interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust (which we refer to as “the Eligibility Interpretation”). In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat and another v Lim Teck Leng and another </span>[2020] SGHC 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>”), however, a different interpretation was proposed by Andre Maniam JC (as he then was) – that the provision bars <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ll </span>persons (including eligible persons) from becoming entitled to an interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust <span class="font-italic">if they </span><span class="font-italic">do not already have an entitlement to the property in question</span> (which we label “the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present appeal raises squarely the question of which interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA should be preferred. Having considered the language of the provision, its legislative history and evolution, as well as the broader contextual and historical developments in which it must be situated, we endorse the Eligibility Interpretation and reject the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation proposed in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>. In this regard, we disagree, with respect, with the analysis of the High Court judge below (“the Judge”), who expressed a tentative preference for the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation at [152] of the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Koon and others v Ong Chai Soon </span>[2021] SGHC 76 (“the Judgment”). We affirm the Judge’s other findings regarding the common intention constructive trust that arose in this case and the inapplicability of the defence of laches. When the Eligibility Interpretation is applied, the consequence of these findings is that the respondents are entitled to the equitable relief they seek. It is on this basis that we dismiss the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The factual background to this case was canvassed in detail by the Judge at [3]–[22] of the Judgment, and we restate the material facts below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The parties are the six children of Mr Ong Chen Kiat and Mdm Ang Mong Kwa: (a) Ms Ong Sor Kim (“SK”); (b) Ms Ong Soh Ai (“SA”); (c) Ms Ong Sor Mui (“SM”); (d) Mr Ong Chai Soon, the appellant and the eldest son of the Ong family; (e) Mr Ong Chai Koon (“CK”); and (f) Ms Ong Kim Geok (“KG”), listed from oldest to youngest (see the Judgment at [3]). We refer to SK, SA, SM, CK and KG collectively as “the respondents”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The properties</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The flats in Yishun </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In 1988, the <span class="font-italic">kampong</span> land on which the Ong family lived was compulsorily acquired by the government. A significant sum was paid to them in compensation (“the compensation moneys”), which was kept and managed by the parties’ mother. Although the precise amount of the compensation moneys was disputed before the Judge, the parties’ evidence suggested that it was somewhere in the range of $100,000 to $176,000 (see the Judgment at [9]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 To assist in their resettlement, the Ong family was offered the opportunity to purchase two adjoining three-room HDB flats in Yishun. One flat (“Unit 172”) was paid for with about $60,000 of the compensation moneys, and was registered in the joint names of the parties’ parents. The other flat (“Unit 174”) was completely financed by a loan from the HDB, and was registered in the joint names of the appellant and CK. It was common ground that the appellant did not make any financial contributions to the payment of the loan for Unit 174 over the years (see the Judgment at [10]). We refer to Unit 172 and Unit 174 collectively as “the Yishun Flats”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The property in Hougang</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In February 1989, a tender for a two-storey HDB shophouse in Hougang (“the Property”) was successfully made in the appellant’s name, resulting in the execution of a tenancy agreement dated 31 March 1989 between the HDB and the appellant (see the Judgment at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Property, which was a shophouse, consisted of a commercial space on the ground floor and a residential unit on the second floor. The commercial space was sub-divided into four separate spaces and let to various sub-tenants. One of these spaces was occupied by a hairdressing salon known as “Red Point Hair Beauty and Trading” (“Red Point”), which was a sole proprietorship registered in the appellant’s name. SK, SM and KG worked at Red Point from its inception until 2018, when the parties’ dispute arose (see the Judgment at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Changes in the ownership and occupancy of the properties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Over the years, the registered ownership of the Yishun Flats and the Property changed several times, as follows (see the Judgment at [13]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Unit 172: In 1994, the parties’ father passed away and their mother became the sole owner of Unit 172. In 1995, SM was added as a joint owner of Unit 172, and she became the sole registered owner of Unit 172 when the parties’ mother passed away in 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Property: In 1995, the HDB offered the Property for sale to the appellant (the existing tenant), which the appellant took up. The purchase price of $782,000 was completely financed by a bank loan. The appellant was registered as the owner of the Property, and remains the sole registered owner to date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Unit 174: In 1999, CK was deregistered as a co-owner of Unit 174 as he wished to apply for an HDB flat of his own. SK replaced him as registered co-owner of Unit 174. To date, the appellant and SK are the registered joint owners of Unit 174.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Similarly, the occupancy of the Yishun Flats and the Property changed several times over the years (see the Judgment at [16]–[18]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Except for KG who was married in 1989, most of the Ong family resided in the Yishun Flats after moving out of the <span class="font-italic">kampong</span>. SA moved out of the Yishun Flats in the mid-1990s, and CK did so in 1999. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant: While the appellant maintained a room at Unit 174, he usually stayed on the second floor of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) SK and SM: In 2003, SK, SM and the parties’ mother moved from Unit 172 to the second floor of the Property. Following this, the Yishun Flats were rented out and the rental proceeds were used to pay for the family’s expenses. After the parties’ mother passed away in 2016, SK and SM continued to live in the Property until they were forced to move out by the appellant in 2018. SK and SM then moved to Unit 174.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events leading up to the suit </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 25 June 2017, a family meeting was held at the Property (“the Family Meeting”). The meeting, which was audio-recorded, lasted for more than two and a half hours. It was described by the Judge as “fractious” with “plenty of shouting and arguing”, and “[m]any longstanding family issues were raised” (see the Judgment at [20]). Towards the end of the meeting, the appellant signed a document (“the Document”) which stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">AGREEMENT</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I, Ong Chai Soon [(NRIC)] agree to share the following properties under my name with all of my siblings equally as the following properties were financially supported by late mother, Ang Mong Kwa, prior to her passing: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. [The Property]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. [Unit 174 of the Yishun Flats]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My five siblings are Ong Sor Kim [(NRIC)], Ong Soh Ai [(NRIC)], Ong Sor Mui [(NRIC)], Ong Chai Koon [(NRIC)], Ong Kim Geok [(NRIC)]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I agree to acknowledge that my siblings and I have an equal say in the matters of the mentioned properties. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the event of selling the mentioned properties, I agree to divide the proceeds equally among my siblings and I.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 After the meeting, the appellant sought legal advice. Subsequently, on 2 July 2017, he made a police report claiming that he had been forced by threats of physical violence to sign the Document (see the Judgment at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 25 January 2018, the appellant began to demand that KG, SK and SM (who worked at Red Point) pay him rent for use of the premises, but they refused. Red Point’s business ceased shortly thereafter (see the Judgment at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On or around 25 June 2018, the appellant applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the respondents. The PPO application was eventually resolved by a settlement agreement in which the parties agreed that the respondents “will not visit” the appellant at the Property, and that this was “without admission of liability by any of the parties” (see the Judgment at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 27 December 2018, the respondents commenced proceedings against the appellant, seeking (among other things) an order that the Property be sold and the sale proceeds divided equally among the six Ong siblings. The respondents claimed that the Property was a family asset held by the appellant on a common intention constructive trust for each of the Ong siblings, who were entitled to equal beneficial shares. Further, they claimed that the doctrine of proprietary estoppel precluded the appellant from denying that he held the Property for the benefit of all the siblings in equal shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge found that the Property and its sale proceeds were subject to a common intention constructive trust in favour of the Ong siblings as beneficial owners in six equal shares. Having examined the evidence in detail, the Judge found that – although there was no direct evidence as such that the Ong siblings and their mother had collectively agreed that the Property should be held by the appellant on trust for the siblings at the time when the HDB offered the Property for sale to the appellant in 1995 – there was sufficient evidence which showed that the Property was intended to be acquired as a family asset for the Ong family as a whole. Furthermore, it was intended that the Property would eventually be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally to assist in the Ong siblings’ retirement. This intention was known to and shared by all the Ong siblings, including the appellant (see the Judgment at [107]). Accordingly, the Judge held that the respondents had established that the Property and its sale proceeds were subject to a common intention constructive trust where the true beneficial owners were the appellant and the respondents in six equal shares (see the Judgment at [108]). The Judge went on to observe that, while this conclusion made it unnecessary to determine whether a resulting trust had arisen in the respondents’ favour, he would have presumed a resulting trust in favour of the parties in equal shares had it been necessary to do so (see the Judgment at [110]–[113]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 However, on an application of the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation (which the Judge expressed a tentative preference for), the Judge held that s 51(10) of the HDA barred the respondents from becoming entitled to a beneficial interest in the Property under the common intention constructive trust (or any resulting trust) as they were not registered owners of the Property (see the Judgment at [152] and [159]). Nevertheless, the Judge took the view that an equity arose in the respondents’ favour in relation to the Property which compelled the appellant to act in a manner consistent with the parties’ common intention that they had equal beneficial shares in the Property and its sale proceeds. To satisfy that equity, the Judge considered it necessary and expedient to order that the Property be sold by the appellant within 12 months and that the net sale proceeds be divided among the Ong siblings in equal one-sixth shares (see the Judgment at [184]–[191] and [194]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The respondents’ proprietary estoppel claim was, however, dismissed by the Judge. The Judge held that the appellant’s general conduct of not asserting any control over matters concerning the Property over the years could not amount to a representation giving rise to a proprietary estoppel. There was scant evidence to show that the appellant was aware of what exactly the respondents were doing which was said to be consistent with their belief that they, too, were equal owners of the Property (see the Judgment at [171]–[172]). Furthermore, sufficient detrimental reliance on the respondents’ part relating to the alleged representation had not been shown (see the Judgment at [174]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The appellant appealed to the Appellate Division of the High Court against the Judge’s decision. The appeal was transferred to the Court of Appeal on 8 October 2021 on the ground that it raised a point of law of public importance, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the proper interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The parties’ cases on appeal focus on three issues: (a) whether the Judge had erred in finding that there was a common intention constructive trust over the Property; (b) whether the doctrine of laches bars the respondents’ claim; and (c) whether s 51(10) of the HDA bars the respondents’ claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the common intention constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 First, the appellant seeks to challenge the Judge’s finding that there was a common intention constructive trust over the Property. The appellant makes three submissions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that the respondents’ inability to lead evidence of their direct contributions to the purchase price of the Property is fatal to their case that there is a common intention constructive trust over the Property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that the respondents have not discharged their burden of proving a common intention constructive trust over the Property, and that there is no evidence of a common intention shared by the Ong siblings that the Property was to be held beneficially by all of them. Specifically, the appellant argues that:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) the Judge had erred in finding that the balance compensation moneys had been applied towards the setting up of Red Point; </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) the Judge had erred in finding that the reason for the Family Meeting was the appellant’s purported covetous behaviour in relation to the Property; </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) the Judge had failed to consider that, based on the appellant’s statements during the Family Meeting, he had conducted himself as if he was the sole beneficial owner; and </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iv) the respondents had tried to engineer the appearance of a common intention constructive trust by forcing the appellant to sign the Document at the Family Meeting, after their mother’s passing. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Third, that the lack of detrimental reliance on the part of the respondents is fatal to their claim that there is a common intention constructive trust over the Property.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In response, the respondents make the following submissions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It is not the case that a common intention constructive trust may only be inferred from direct financial contributions. In any case, the respondents had made direct financial contributions towards the purchase of the Property, given that the mortgage loan for the Property had been paid for entirely by funds that belonged beneficially to the Ong siblings (namely, the sub-tenancy rental proceeds from the Property and the earnings from Red Point). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Judge was correct to find that the respondents had proved the common intention constructive trust. The testimony of the respondents’ witnesses was consistent and believable, whereas the appellant’s evidence was confusing and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the appellant’s arguments regarding the Family Meeting have no merit in light of the Judge’s factual findings regarding that meeting, which ought not to be disturbed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) KG, SK and SM’s taking of meagre salaries over the 28 years of their tenure with Red Point, and the free carpentry work carried out by CK, constitute detrimental reliance for the purposes of the common intention constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On the doctrine of laches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The appellant further submits that the doctrine of laches applies to bar the respondents’ claim because the respondents ought to have raised their interest in the Property while the parties’ mother was still alive, and their failure to do so has prejudiced the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The respondents, on the other hand, submit that the doctrine of laches does not apply. There was no substantial lapse of time and the time taken for the respondents to assert their claim was reasonable in the circumstances. The respondents highlight the fact that the appellant had not exhibited any conduct showing that he intended to claim sole beneficial ownership of the Property while the parties’ mother was still alive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On s 51(10) of the HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Finally, the appellant submits that s 51(10) of the HDA applies to bar the respondents’ claim, whether on the Eligibility Interpretation or on the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation. On the Eligibility Interpretation, the respondents have not shown why they would be eligible to acquire the Property and would have an interest in the Property under a common intention constructive trust. On the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation (which the appellant submits should be adopted by this court), the restriction in s 51(10) is unqualified and does not depend on eligibility, and instead encompasses any interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The respondents submit that s 51(10) of the HDA does not bar their claim. The Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation should not be adopted as it is against the weight of authority. In any case, even on that approach, the Judge was not prevented from ordering a sale of the Property and that the sale proceeds be distributed equally among the parties. This is because s 51(10) does not prevent a common intention constructive trust (or an equity in respect of the Property by virtue of the common intention constructive trust) from <span class="font-italic">arising</span>; it merely provides that the respondents cannot <span class="font-italic">acquire an interest</span> <span class="font-italic">in the Property</span> by it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 From the parties’ arguments before us, three broad issues arise for our determination in this appeal:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the Judge had erred in finding that the parties had a common intention to acquire the Property as a family asset, which would eventually be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the doctrine of laches bars the respondents’ claim; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether s 51(10) of the HDA bars the respondents’ claim.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While the third issue, as our introductory remarks suggest, forms the focus of our analysis, we deal with it only after addressing the first and second issues as our decision on those issues provides an important backdrop to our decision on the third issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Common intention constructive trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We begin with the issue of whether the Judge had erred in finding that the parties shared a common intention to acquire the Property as an income-generating family asset, which would eventually be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally to provide a “retirement fund” for each of them (see the Judgment at [92] and [107]). This finding was, in turn, based on the following key findings made by the Judge after considering all the evidence before him (including the credibility and cogency of the various witnesses’ testimony):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, that the mortgage instalments for the loan taken out to finance the purchase of the Property were paid for using a <span class="font-italic">mixed fund</span> which comprised mostly the sub-tenancy rental proceeds and the earnings from Red Point’s business (see the Judgment at [82] and [85]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that <span class="font-italic">Red Point </span><span class="font-italic">itself</span> was set up using funds from the parties’ mother and the compensation moneys, and that the parties’ intention was always that it was a family business operated for the benefit of all the Ong siblings, such that the profits it generated belonged to the Ong siblings in equal shares (see the Judgment at [93] and [99]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, that the <span class="font-italic">compensation moneys</span> were treated by the Ong family as a communal or family fund to pay for the family’s expenses and to set up businesses for the family’s benefit. Thus, the Ong family had treated the Yishun Flats (which were acquired mainly using the compensation moneys) as assets that would ultimately be shared by all the Ong siblings (see the Judgment at [87]–[88]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, that the <span class="font-italic">parties’</span> <span class="font-italic">conduct in relation to the</span> <span class="font-italic">Property</span> was consistent with a common intention that it was to be shared beneficially by all of them, and that, at some later stage, the Property would be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally by them. The appellant’s conduct over the years was consistent with his belief that the Property was part of the pool of family assets, instead of being beneficially owned by him solely. While there was no direct evidence that the parties and their mother had collectively met to discuss and agree that the Property should be held by the appellant on trust for the Ong siblings in 1995 (when the HDB offered the Property for sale to the appellant), there was sufficient evidence which showed that the acquisition of the Property was intended for the Ong family as a whole (just like the Yishun Flats and Red Point’s business), and that this intention was known to and shared by all the Ong siblings, including the appellant (see the Judgment at [100] and [107]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This led the Judge to conclude that an assessment of the totality of the evidence supported the respondents’ case that the Property and its sale proceeds were subject to a common intention constructive trust where the true beneficial owners were the respondents and the appellant in six equal shares (see the Judgment at [107]–[108]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In our view, the appellant has provided no basis for disturbing the Judge’s findings and conclusion on this point, which – we reiterate – were arrived at after a thorough consideration of the facts and the parties’ evidence. We deal briefly with the various arguments raised by the appellant on appeal, none of which we found to be persuasive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The first plank of the appellant’s case in this regard is his submission that the respondents’ inability to show that they made direct financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property is fatal to their claim that a common intention constructive trust exists over the same. We are unable to accept this submission either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact. On the <span class="font-italic">facts</span>, we see no reason to depart from the Judge’s finding that the Property was paid for using a mixed fund comprising the sub-tenancy rental proceeds (the ownership of which is inextricably linked to the question of who beneficially owned the Property) and the earnings from Red Point, which belonged to all the Ong siblings in equal shares. In these circumstances, the use of Red Point’s earnings to pay the mortgage instalments for the Property would suffice to show a direct financial contribution by the respondents to the purchase of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 More importantly, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">law</span>, the appellant’s fixation on direct financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property takes <span class="font-italic">too narrow</span> a view of the common intention constructive trust analysis. The authorities relied on by the appellant do not support such a narrow approach. Instead, the court is ultimately concerned with identifying whether the parties shared a <span class="font-italic">common intention</span> as to the beneficial interest in the property. Although direct financial contributions to the purchase price of that property are an important consideration, they are not the only basis upon which the court may infer such a common intention. This was clearly set out by this court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [97]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… X acquires a beneficial interest in a property by way of a common intention constructive trust when he relies to his detriment on a common intention that the beneficial interest in the property is to be shared. <span class="font-italic">Such a common intention may: (a) arise from an express discussion; or (b) take the form of an inferred common intention, as evidenced by direct financial contributions by X to the purchase price of the property; or (c) in exceptional </span><span class="font-italic">situations, arise from other conduct by X which gives rise to an implied common intention.</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 These principles were reiterated in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 at [83], where this court observed that “the common intention … between the parties may either be express or inferred”, and that “there must be <span class="font-italic">sufficient and compelling</span> evidence of the express or inferred common intention” [emphasis in original]. More recently, in <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co Pte Ltd v Koh Ai Gek and others </span>[2019] 1 SLR 908 (“<span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co</span>”) at [80], this court stated that an inferred common intention could arise from other forms of conduct in “exceptional situations”, although “the focus remains very much on the financial contributions of the parties”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The present case is such an exceptional situation because <span class="font-italic">neither</span> the appellant <span class="font-italic">nor</span> the respondents can be said to have made any direct financial contributions towards the purchase price of the Property in the typical manner, such as by using moneys from their personal bank accounts or Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts. Instead, the mortgage instalments were paid using primarily the sub-tenancy rental proceeds and Red Point’s earnings. Thus, as we pointed out during the hearing to counsel for the appellant, Mr Choo Zheng Xi (“Mr Choo”), there is no <span class="font-italic">direct</span> evidence of <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the parties’ direct financial contributions to the purchase price. In these circumstances, focusing on the parties’ direct financial contributions in analysing their common intention would not be apposite, and the Judge was justified in inferring <span class="font-italic">from the</span> <span class="font-italic">totality of the evidence</span> that the parties’ common intention was for each of them to have an equal beneficial share in the Property and its sale proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The second plank of the appellant’s case is that the Judge had failed to appreciate that the respondents had not discharged their burden of proving that a common intention constructive trust existed over the Property, and had therefore erred in his findings of fact on various points (as summarised at [22(b)] above). It suffices to state that, in our judgment, the appellant’s contentions in this regard are without merit, and there is no basis to disturb the specific findings of fact made by the Judge which the appellant takes issue with on appeal. These findings are far from being plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, which the Judge considered in meticulous detail before arriving at his conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The third and final plank of the appellant’s case regarding the common intention constructive trust over the Property (aside from the effect of s 51(10) of the HDA, which we shall come to shortly) is that the lack of detrimental reliance by the respondents is fatal to their common intention constructive trust claim. The appellant relies on the Judge’s finding (at [174] of the Judgment) that the respondents’ mere acts of accepting allegedly “meagre salaries” at Red Point and carrying out carpentry work for free did not constitute sufficient detrimental reliance. Further, the appellant submits that these acts must be considered alongside the benefits derived by the respondents, and in the context of the familial relationship – in particular, the fact that SK and SM lived at the Property rent-free, and that CK operated his audio business rent-free in one of the spaces in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We disagree. While detrimental reliance is indeed necessary to establish a claim under a common intention constructive trust (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Thiam Loke v </span><span class="font-italic">Woon Swee Kheng Christina </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 595 at [18] (citing the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset </span>[1991] 1 AC 107 at 132–133); <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [97]; and the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Hoon Woon (executor and trustee of the estate of Lai Thai Lok, deceased) v Lai Foong Sin and another </span>[2016] SGHC 113 at [140]), there was in fact detrimental reliance by the respondents in the present case. Although the Judge did not couch his analysis in the express language of detrimental reliance, he considered how the respondents had conducted themselves in reliance on the parties’ common intention regarding the Property. Specifically, he found that KG, SK and SM worked at Red Point for 28 years taking relatively meagre salaries because they regarded Red Point as a family business and they believed that the earnings of Red Point would be pooled with the family funds and used to service the mortgage loan on the Property, which they regarded as a family asset of which they each owned a part (see the Judgment at [101]); and that CK did renovation, fitting-out and carpentry work for the space which Red Point would occupy in the Property because he regarded Red Point and the Property as family assets (see the Judgment at [103]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In this regard, the present case is clearly distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co</span>, this court held that undertaking renovation works and withdrawing an HDB flat application did not constitute detriment for the purposes of a common intention constructive trust and/or proprietary estoppel. The court observed in that case that whatever equity that had arisen by virtue of the renovation works was extinguished by the fact that the claimant had enjoyed the benefits of such renovations and had lived rent-free in the property for over 15 years. Furthermore, it was speculative whether the claimant could have made capital gains if he had obtained his own HDB flat (see <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co </span>at [91]–[92]). The detriment suffered by the respondents in this case <span class="font-italic">clearly </span><span class="font-italic">exceeds</span> the detriment alleged in <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co</span>. Not only did the respondents take meagre salaries for 28 years and do carpentry work for free, they also consented to Red Point’s earnings (which belonged beneficially to all of them) being used to pay the mortgage instalments for the Property. The appellant’s reliance on the fact that SK and SM lived at the Property rent-free and CK operated his own business rent-free from the Property is also misguided as this conduct is in fact <span class="font-italic">consistent</span> with the existence of the common intention constructive trust, given that the appellant’s consent does not appear to have been expressly sought or required for the Property to be used in this way when these arrangements began.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Further, although the Judge was “unconvinced that the mere act of accepting ‘meagre salaries’ at Red Point and working on carpentry work for free would suffice as detrimental reliance” (see the Judgment at [174]), this was in the context of the respondents’ claim in <span class="font-italic">proprietary estoppel</span>. Given the conceptual differences between proprietary estoppel and common intention constructive trusts, the Judge’s observation that there was no detrimental reliance for the purposes of proprietary estoppel does not necessarily mean that there was no detrimental reliance for the purposes of the common intention constructive trust. In the context of proprietary estoppel, the detriment must be suffered in reliance on the relevant <span class="font-italic">representation </span>(see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co </span>at [94] and the Judgment at [174]); whereas in the context of a common intention constructive trust, the relevant detriment is that suffered in reliance on the <span class="font-italic">common intention </span>as to the sharing of the beneficial interest in the property (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [97]). While the respondents’ acts may not be referable to any <span class="font-italic">representation</span> made by the appellant, the Judge’s findings set out at [39] above show that these acts were carried out in reliance on the<span class="font-italic"> common intention</span> that the Red Point business and the Property were family assets of which the parties each owned a part. In our view, there was sufficient detrimental reliance by the respondents to found their common intention constructive trust claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Thus, none of these submissions takes the appellant very far. Indeed, as Mr Choo acknowledged during the hearing, the strongest point the appellant could raise to challenge the Judge’s findings regarding the common intention constructive trust was that the legal title to the Property was registered in the appellant’s sole name, in contrast to the Yishun Flats which were registered in the joint names of either the parties’ parents (in the case of Unit 172) or the appellant and CK (in the case of Unit 174). This, however, misses the mark. While the manner in which the different properties were registered is certainly <span class="font-italic">one </span>consideration in ascertaining the parties’ common intention, it is far from being conclusive, and it must be viewed in its proper context and weighed against all the other evidence. The Judge was no doubt cognisant of the manner in which the Yishun Flats were held, and went on to remark that the parties “treated those Yishun [F]lats not much differently from the [Property]” (see the Judgment at [88]–[90]). Yet, having considered the totality of the evidence before him, the Judge ultimately concluded that – notwithstanding the fact that the Property was registered in the appellant’s sole name – the parties shared a common intention that the Property was a family asset, the sale proceeds of which would be shared equally among all of them. For the reasons we have set out above, we affirm this conclusion and the Judge’s decision in this respect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Doctrine of laches </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The appellant’s next submission is that the doctrine of laches bars the respondents’ claim. The appellant argues that it was unconscionable for the respondents not to have asserted their beneficial interest in the Property while the parties’ mother was still alive, and that the respondents have provided no satisfactory explanation for not doing so. The parties’ mother now cannot be cross-examined, and this is prejudicial to the appellant as she would have been a key witness who could have attested to the parties’ common intention regarding the Property and whether the compensation moneys were applied towards starting the Red Point business for the benefit of the entire Ong family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Preliminarily, and as the appellant rightly acknowledged, this is a new point that was not argued before the Judge. The appellant did not seek the court’s leave to introduce this point as required under O 57 r 9A(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). Nevertheless, the respondents did not object to this point being raised and responded substantively to it in their Respondents’ Case. Moreover, as this point can be determined on appeal without further evidence (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Liew Kit Fah and others v Koh Keng Chew and others</span> [2020] 1 SLR 275 at [14]), we see no obstacle to considering it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 However, the appellant’s submission on the doctrine of laches fails on the merits. The applicable principles are well-established. Citing the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP</span><span class="font-italic"> Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 at [46], this court explained<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [97] of <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co </span>that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Laches is a doctrine of equity. It is properly invoked where essentially there has been a <span class="font-italic">substantial lapse of time</span> coupled with <span class="font-italic">circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy</span> either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or, where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted … This is a broad-based inquiry and it would be relevant to consider the <span class="font-italic">length of delay</span> <span class="font-italic">before the claim was brought</span>, the <span class="font-italic">nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant</span>, as well as any element of <span class="font-italic">unconscionability</span> in allowing the claim to be enforced … [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the facts of the present case, there is no basis for the doctrine of laches to bar the respondents’ claim. As the Judge observed, it was only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the death of the parties’ mother in 2016 that the appellant “started acting in a way which caused the [respondents] to believe that he would attempt to claim beneficial ownership over the [Property]” (see the Judgment at [19]). Specifically, around late 2017 to early 2018, the appellant began to assert sole beneficial ownership of the Property. For example, he made a police report claiming that he owned the Property entirely; demanded rent from KG, SK and SM for use of the premises for Red Point’s business; and forced SK and SM to move out from the second floor of the Property (see the Judgment at [18]–[21]). The proceedings in the suit were commenced by the respondents several months later, on 27 December 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The appellant claims that he had requested CK to remove his items from the Property as early as 2014, and that the respondents could have asserted their beneficial interest in the Property at that time. However, we agree with the respondents that this is based on thin evidence – namely, a few comments made by the appellant during the Family Meeting. Furthermore, the appellant’s request to CK did not necessarily indicate that the appellant was thereby trying to assert his beneficial ownership to the exclusion of the respondents. This only became clear in late 2017 to early 2018 when, despite having signed the Document, the appellant began to take active steps to exclude the respondents from the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In our judgment, the present case is distinguishable from the rather exceptional facts of <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co </span>itself, on which the appellant seeks to rely. In <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co</span>, the party’s failure to take steps to assert his alleged beneficial interest spanned a substantial period of almost 40 years, with no reasonable explanation for the “inordinate” delay, and that party (who had since passed on) was the <span class="font-italic">only</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>person then still alive who was privy to the alleged oral representation which would have supported his claim to be entitled to a beneficial interest in the property, which he asserted by way of a statutory declaration mere days before he passed on. In those circumstances, this court found that it was “unconscionable for [that party] not to have taken any step to establish his claim long before he passed on”, and that this was extremely prejudicial to the other party who was deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses on various matters that would have been essential to the claim (see <span class="font-italic">Geok</span><span class="font-italic"> Hong Co </span>at [98] and [100]–[101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, given that the appellant only began asserting sole beneficial ownership of the Property in late 2017 to early 2018, and the respondents commenced proceedings against him in December 2018 (less than two years later), it cannot be said that there was a substantial lapse of time, and these facts provide a reasonable explanation for the respondents asserting their beneficial interest in the Property only after the parties’ mother had passed on. Further, there are no circumstances that would make it practically unjust for the respondents to be granted a remedy, particularly because the parties’ mother was not the only witness who could give evidence on the parties’ common intention regarding the Property. Accordingly, we reject the appellant’s submission based on the doctrine of laches. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 51(10) of the HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We turn now to the issue that, in our view, lies at the heart of this appeal: the proper interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA, and consequently its effect on the respondents’ common intention constructive trust claim. Section 51(10) and the two sub-provisions that precede it (ss 51(8) and 51(9)) provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Property not to be used as security or attached, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">etc</span><span class="font-weight-bold">., and no</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> trust in respect thereof to be created without approval of Board</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">51.</span>— … (8) No trust in respect of any protected property shall be created by the owner thereof without the prior written approval of the Board. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9) Every trust which purports to be created in respect of any protected property without the prior written approval of the Board shall be null and void. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) <span class="font-italic">No person shall</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">become entitled</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or arising</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was common ground between the parties that the Property was “protected property” within the meaning of s 51(10) (see the Judgment at [141]). The appellant urges us to adopt the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation preferred by the Judge on the ground that the restriction in s 51(10) is unqualified and broadly framed, and that its language does not distinguish between eligible and ineligible persons. Nevertheless, Mr Choo was prepared to accept that the Eligibility Interpretation was also a valid interpretation of s 51(10). The respondents submit that the Eligibility Interpretation should be preferred on a purposive approach to s 51(10), and that the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation is against the weight of authority.

This provision, introduced in 1964 by s 9 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Ordinance 1964 (No 10 of 1964) (“the 1964 Amendment Ordinance”), stated as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Implied conditions as to flats</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">36E.</span>— … (4) Every trust or alleged trust, whether such trust be express, implied or constructive, which purports to be created in respect of any such flat [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a flat sold by the HDB] by the owner thereof shall be null and void and shall be incapable of being enforced by any court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This provision later became s 44(4) of the 1970 HDA, which (as amended by s 6 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Act 1971 (Act 15 of 1971)) provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Implied conditions as to flats</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">44.</span>— … (4) Every trust or alleged trust, whether the trust is express, implied or constructive, which purports to be created in respect of any such flat, house or other building by the owner thereof shall be null and void and shall be incapable of being enforced by any court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sections 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Pursuant to s 3 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Act 1984 (Act 30 of 1984), s 44(4) of the 1970 HDA was replaced by ss 44(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 44(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) – and was renumbered ss 51(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 51(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in the 1985 Revised Edition<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 HDA”).

That case concerned a sibling dispute over the ownership of an HDB flat. The flat had initially been held jointly by the respondent and the parties’ mother. Subsequently, the respondent transferred his legal interest in the flat to his mother after buying another HDB flat with his family. After their mother passed away, the appellants (who were his siblings) claimed that the flat formed part of their mother’s estate such that all the siblings were entitled to an equal share of the flat. On the other hand, the respondent contended that, as he had paid the purchase price and all outgoings even after their mother’s death, he was the beneficial owner of the flat by operation of a resulting trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The issue before the court was whether the alleged resulting trust was prohibited by s 51(4) and void under s 51(5) of the 1997 HDA, which in turn required a consideration of whether the resulting trust was “created” for the purpose of these provisions. The court referred (at [18]) to the Parliamentary speech by the then Minister for National Development, Mr Teh Cheang Wan (“Mr Teh”), which stated as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(24 August 1984) vol 44 at col 2025):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the Act now stands, no trust in any form can be created in respect of an HDB dwelling or property. <span class="font-italic">The original intention of this provision was to prevent abuse by persons not eligible for </span><span class="font-italic">HDB flats from purchasing a flat in the name of nominees.</span> Over the years, however, <span class="font-italic">there has been increasing need for </span><span class="font-italic">the HDB to permit the creation of trusts for legitimate reasons</span>. For example, it is necessary to empower trustees to hold flats in trust for minor children who are citizens in the event of death of the lessee parent, and where the surviving parent is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident and therefore not eligible to assume ownership of the flat. Similarly, in some cases of legal separation or divorce, flats have to be held in trust for minor children until they reach the age of 21 years. <span class="font-italic">Clause</span><span class="font-italic"> 3 of this Amendment Bill, therefore, seeks to allow a trust to be created in respect of an HDB dwelling provided such trust is approved by the Board.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In holding that the resulting trust in the respondent’s favour <span class="font-italic">was</span> prohibited and void, this court reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, despite the relaxation of the prohibition in s 44(4) of the 1970 HDA to permit the creation of trusts with the HDB’s prior written approval <span class="font-italic">via </span>the introduction of ss 51(4) and 51(5), “the underlying purpose of the prohibition remain[ed] unchanged”. This purpose would be undermined if a resulting trust arising from the purchaser’s payment of the purchase price of the property was permitted, notwithstanding that any <span class="font-italic">express</span> trust attempted to be created by the purchaser and nominee without the HDB’s approval would be prohibited. This “would give rise to a highly unsatisfactory result and would open the way to abuse by persons who would and could easily purchase HDB properties through nominees”, which “would frustrate the policy of the [1997 HDA] and could not have been intended by Parliament” (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, by transferring his entire interest in the flat to his mother while intending to remain the beneficial owner of the flat and for his mother to hold the flat on trust for him, the respondent had “in effect ‘created’ a trust of the flat in his favour”. Accordingly, the resulting trust had been “created” by the respondent within the meaning of ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen</span> at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The next case concerning ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA was the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee bte Kader v Rosiyah bte Abdullah </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span>”). This case concerned a dispute between a mother and a daughter over an HDB flat that they had purchased in their names as joint tenants. S Rajendran J found that the contributions of the mother and the daughter towards the purchase of the flat were approximately in the ratio of 23:77. Thus, applying ordinary “equitable considerations”, an equitable tenancy in common existed whereby the mother held a 23% share in the flat while the daughter held 77% (see <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10] and [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Rajendran J then considered whether this resulting trust survived the application of s 51(4). He first held that, as the parties had initially purchased the flat as joint tenants and had no express intention of creating any trust at that time, the resulting trust in this case had not been “created” but instead arose by presumption of law. There was no policy objection to affirming the resulting trust in these circumstances; a tenancy in common at law would have been acceptable to the HDB if the parties had arranged for it, and the parties had no intention of flouting any HDB requirements. Citing the same Ministerial speech referred to in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen</span>, Rajendran J observed that “the underlying intent of s 51(4) was to prevent ineligible persons … from using such trusts to acquire interests in HDB flats, and thereby circumvent the intention of Parliament to confer the privileges of HDB housing only on persons fulfilling certain eligibility criteria” (see <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]–[15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Rajendran J also explained that this court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>“was not … making a blanket statement that all resulting trusts would be void under s 51(4)”. Instead, <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>“must be interpreted in the negative to mean simply that not all resulting trusts are outside the scope of the section”. Thus, a resulting trust would be prohibited under s 51(4) “[i]f a party sets about creating a situation where a resulting trust will arise in his favour <span class="font-italic">in order to circumvent the provisions of </span><span class="font-italic">the HDB flat</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]). Accordingly, Rajendran J distinguished <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>on the basis that the resulting trust in that case had been “created” by the respondent “when he divested his legal interest in the flat to his mother … in order to make it appear that he had no interest in the first flat which violated s 51(4) of the [1997 HDA]”. In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span>, there was “no intention on the part of any party to ‘create’ a resulting trust to defeat the objectives of the [1997 HDA]”. On the contrary, the parties’ conduct “was within the parameters set by the HDB and they at all times remained the registered owners of the flat” (see <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke Kuen </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were considered by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan v Ng Kim Whatt</span> [2000] SGHC 31 (“<span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan</span>”). Similarly to <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span>, this case involved an HDB flat which had been jointly purchased by a mother and her son. Subsequently, the relationship between the parties became strained and the son moved out. The mother sought a declaration that she was absolutely entitled to the flat and to have the title in the flat transferred entirely to her. In allowing the mother’s claim, Prakash J found that she had been the sole contributor to the purchase price of the flat, and that if the flat were private property, the son would hold the whole of his legal share on trust for his mother (see <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>at [10] and [12]). Furthermore, ss 51(4) and 51(5) did not bar the mother’s claim, for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the original legislation, which “did not even admit the possibility of a trust over an HDB flat being created with the consent of the HDB”, was intended to “prevent abuse by persons not eligible for HDB flats from purchasing a flat in the name of a nominee”. The introduction of ss 51(4) and 51(5) represented Parliament’s recognition that this “evil … could be eliminated without also eliminating all possibility of creating a trust over an HDB flat” (see <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen</span>, the respondent had “deliberately created the impression that he no longer had any legal or beneficial interest in the first flat”. Although he “had not in the literal sense of the word ‘created’ a trust by executing a trust document, he had taken a deliberate action to misrepresent the ownership situation and thereby create the appearance of sole ownership in his mother whilst all along intending to retain his own beneficial interest in the first flat”. The court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen</span> thus “gave a purposive definition to the word ‘created’ … so as to ensure that the legislative intent to prevent nominee ownership would not be flouted” (see <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>at [17]–[18]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In contrast, the parties in <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan</span> itself “had no intention of circumventing any HDB regulation or policy” and did not do so. Accordingly, the resulting trust in this case, which arose by way of legal implication, “was not created by the [mother] either literally or in the sense given to that word by the Court of Appeal [in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen</span>]”. It could thus be given effect to and was not rendered void by s 51(5) (see <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>at [17]–[19]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Prakash J also agreed with the reasoning of Rajendran J at [14]–[15] and [20] of <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(as summarised above), and adopted it as an additional ground for the finding that the trust in <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>was valid and enforceable (see <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 51(6) of the 2004 HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Following these cases, the 2004 Revised Edition of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the 2004 HDA”) was enacted. Section 6 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Act 2005 (Act 29 of 2005) then introduced an additional provision in s 51 – s 51(6) – which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Flats, houses or other buildings not to be attached, etc., and no trust in respect thereof to be created without approval of Board</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">51.</span>— …<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>(6) No person shall become entitled to any such flat, house or other building under any resulting trust or constructive trust, whensoever created. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Section 51(6) was considered in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>. A father and son had purchased an HDB flat as joint tenants. Subsequently, the father unilaterally severed the joint tenancy and, in his will, bequeathed his share in the HDB flat to his wife. Upon the father’s death, the son sought an order that the flat be sold and the net sale proceeds divided in the ratio of the parties’ contributions towards its purchase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Turning first to ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 2004 HDA (which were retained from the 1997 HDA), Menon JC (as he then was) observed that these provisions prohibited the creation of express trusts. They also prohibited<span class="font-italic"> </span>“any trust that could in some way be said to have been ‘created’ through a connivance between the parties even if the form of the transaction was such that it might have given rise to a resulting trust” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Next, in considering the effect of s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA, Menon JC had regard to the Parliamentary speech of the then Minister for National Development, Mr Mah Bow Tan (“Mr Mah”) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(15 August 2005) vol 80 at col 1259):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 51 to make it clear that, in addition to prohibiting the voluntary creation of trusts over an HDB flat, the [2004 HDA] also prohibits any person from becoming entitled to a [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] HDB flat under a resulting trust or constructive trust. <span class="font-italic">This will help to prevent a situation where a </span><span class="font-italic">person who is ineligible to own an HDB flat may become entitled to own one, for example, by paying the purchase price of the flat on behalf of the owner. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Based on this speech, Menon JC analysed Parliament’s intention behind s 51(6) of the HDA as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It becomes clear when one has regard to that statement that Parliament’s intention was <span class="font-italic">not</span> to prevent any interest in an HDB flat arising under a resulting trust or a constructive trust regardless of the circumstances, but rather <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to prevent any entitlement to own an </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">HDB flat arising in favour of a person by virtue of the law implying a resulting or constructive trust, where that person would otherwise have been ineligible to acquire such an interest</span>. In my judgment, having regard to the mischief underlying the section, the provision was not intended to have any application where the parties concerned were already entitled to some interest in the property and therefore no issue could arise as to their eligibility to such entitlement. In such circumstances, the parties concerned would not be claiming to <span class="font-italic">become </span>entitled to own an interest in the flat by virtue of the implied trust and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there would be no concern of their bypassing the eligibility criteria set by </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the HDB from time to time</span>. [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Menon JC held that two further points supported this view of s 51(6):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, both s 51(6) and Mr Mah’s statement used the phrase “become entitled”, which could be contrasted with the much plainer and simpler formulations “be entitled to any interest in” or “acquire any interest in” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the effect of <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>was “that a person could not acquire an interest in an HDB flat through a constructive or resulting trust if he was ineligible to do so under the provisions of the [HDA] and the HDB’s eligibility criteria”. To construe s 51(6) (which was enacted with retrospective effect) as going further than <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>would mean that Parliament was “retrospectively displacing accrued property rights”. There was nothing in Mr Mah’s speech to suggest that this was intended in the enactment (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [12]–[15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Applying this interpretation of s 51(6), as there was no suggestion that either party was ineligible or did not already have some entitlement to the flat, Menon JC held that s 51(6) had no application (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 51(10) of the HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In 2010, the HDA was amended once again by s 5 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act 18 of 2010), such that ss 51(4)–51(6) were renumbered as ss 51(8)–51(10) and read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Property not to be used as security or attached, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">etc</span><span class="font-weight-bold">., and no</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> trust in respect thereof to be created without approval of Board</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">51.</span>— … (8) No trust in respect of any protected property shall be created by the owner thereof without the prior written approval of the Board. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(9) Every trust which purports to be created in respect of any protected property without the prior written approval of the Board shall be null and void. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(10) <span class="font-italic">No person shall</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">become entitled</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or arising</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Notably, s 51(10) of the HDA is substantially similar to s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA, which was considered in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>.

In that case, the issue was whether the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">donatio</span><span class="font-italic"> mortis causa </span>offended s 51(10). Turning first to the amended HDA provisions, Prakash J opined that Menon JC’s interpretation in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>remained good law under s 51(10) (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng </span>at [56]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the amended legislation includes the words “or arising” at the end of the relevant provision, <span class="font-italic">in my opinion the addition of the words </span><span class="font-italic">“or arising” only clarify that a “resulting trust” or a “constructive trust” may be more properly said to arise by operation of law, rather than by the creation of parties</span>. It is neither evident from Hansard, nor from the plain reading of the provision, that Parliament was seeking to change the legal position as it stood in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>. Indeed, if such a change was deemed necessary, Parliament could have said for instance, “No person shall become entitled, <span class="font-italic">regardless of eligibility</span>, …”. This Parliament did not do. Furthermore, the words “become entitled”, which formed the basis for Menon JC’s judgment, were left unchanged by Parliament. As Menon JC expressly noted in his judgment, it would have been much “plainer and simpler” for Parliament to have said that no person shall “be entitled to any interest in” an HDB flat if Parliament were indeed minded to prohibit <span class="font-italic">all </span>trusts, regardless of the beneficiary’s eligibility (<span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [11]). Again, Parliament did not make such a change. <span class="font-italic">Accordingly, in my view, the law regarding creation of trusts over </span><span class="font-italic">HDB property remains as stated in </span>Tan Chui Lian<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Thus, Prakash J concluded that “resulting and constructive trusts are not precluded by the HDA if the beneficiary is eligible to own an HDB flat” (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng </span>at [57]). Accordingly, as the plaintiff was an eligible person, the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">donatio</span><span class="font-italic"> mortis causa </span>did not offend s 51(10) of the HDA. To conclude otherwise “would unfairly, and unnecessarily, impinge upon the rights of HDB flat owners to deal with their flats” and “would also be inconsistent with the intention of Parliament in enacting s 51(10), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, to prevent ineligible persons from obtaining any interest in an HDB flat” (see <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng </span>at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Following <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng</span>, the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span> has been followed in most High Court decisions, which have treated <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">eligibility</span> as the primary determinant of whether s 51(10) of the HDA precludes a claim under a resulting or constructive trust. We set out some examples below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Low</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</span> [2013] 3 SLR 710 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy</span>”) at [18]–[21], Quentin Loh J (as he then was) held that the objective of s 51(10) was “to prevent ineligible persons from taking an interest in HDB flats” by “prevent[ing] an ineligible person from taking an interest in the flat as a result of any transaction or transfer which might purport to do so”. The words “become entitled” suggested that ineligible persons who were not allowed to have an interest in HDB flats could not have such an interest just because they were beneficiaries under a resulting or constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">BWU and another v BWW and another matter</span> [2019] SGHC 128 at [5] and [9], Choo Han Teck J observed that s 51(10) complemented s 47(1) of the HDA (which placed certain restrictions on the purchase of HDB property) by preventing ineligible persons from acquiring an interest in HDB flats via<span class="font-italic"> </span>a resulting or constructive trust implied by law, and held that s 51(10) thus prohibited one of the plaintiffs (who was an ineligible person) from being entitled to any interest in the flat by way of a constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Philip Antony </span><span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam and another v Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal and others (Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pamabayan, third party; Pramela d/o Govindasamy and another, non-parties)</span> [2020] 3 SLR 738 at [26] and [29], Debbie Ong J held that, as there was no dispute that the plaintiffs were not eligible persons for the purposes of the HDA, s 51(10) applied and there could be no constructive trust over the HDB flat. Accordingly, there was no basis to order a sale of the flat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ong Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Geok and another v Gee Ah Eng </span>[2021] 5 SLR 726 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Geok</span>”) at [25]–[29], Maniam JC applied the interpretation that s 51(10) prevents a person who is ineligible to acquire an HDB flat from obtaining or becoming entitled to an interest in such a flat by way of a resulting or constructive trust. As the applicants had expressly accepted that they were ineligible to acquire the flat, Maniam JC held that s 51(10) applied to bar their claim to the beneficial interest in the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The exception to the line of case law summarised above is Maniam JC’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>, which preceded his decision in <span class="font-italic">Ong Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Geok</span>. That case concerned two flats which were purchased, a few years apart, in the sole name of the plaintiffs’ son, with the first flat having been gazetted for compulsory acquisition by the government before either flat was purchased. The plaintiffs claimed that they had paid for the flats in full, and that they had a common understanding with their son that they were the owners of those flats. According to the plaintiffs, they had registered the flats under their son’s name to avoid incurring an HDB resale levy. Thus, they contended that they were the beneficial owners of the flats on a resulting trust or a common intention constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In rejecting the plaintiffs’ claim, Maniam JC first held that the purported creation of a trust over the flats without the HDB’s prior written approval was prohibited by s 51(8) and null and void under s 51(9) of the HDA. Maniam JC emphasised that the alleged trust had been created with the express intention of circumventing HDB regulation or policy in relation to the payment of resale levies and eligibility for HDB housing loans. In doing so, the plaintiffs created a façade that their son was the sole owner of the flats and deliberately misrepresented the ownership situation (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [48], [57], [62], [67] and [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Maniam JC went on to hold that s 51(10) <span class="font-italic">also</span> applied to defeat the plaintiffs’ claim. Maniam JC opined that s 51(10) “draws no distinction between eligible and ineligible persons, in relation to whether they can ‘become entitled’ to an HDB flat”, and “does not merely apply to bar otherwise ineligible owners from becoming entitled to an HDB flat (or an interest in it) under a resulting trust or a constructive trust” (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [80] and [86]). In this regard, Maniam JC distinguished <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span>, <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the basis that in those cases, the parties had been registered co-owners of the flats in question and there was also no issue as to their eligibility. Furthermore, in those cases, “there was no intention to circumvent any HDB regulation or policy, and the court was simply asked to determine the parties’ beneficial interests in the properties”. In contrast, this case involved “nominee ownership”, where the plaintiffs were not registered owners and their purported interests were “hidden from the HDB” (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat v Lim Teck Leng and another and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1328 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA)</span>”), this court dismissed the appeal against Maniam JC’s decision. The court observed that, on the plaintiffs’ own evidence, the entire arrangement in relation to the flats was a “nominee arrangement”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “an intentional arrangement for them to avoid paying the resale levy and for the [son] to be able to obtain a housing loan, while they held the beneficial interest in the flats”. This would be a trust which was “created” or “purports to be created”, in the language of ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA. The plaintiffs having failed to obtain the HDB’s prior written approval, the purported trust was null and void under s 51(9) (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Furthermore, this court found that as the plaintiffs were ineligible to purchase the second flat without paying the resale levy, they were precluded by s 51(10) of the HDA from claiming beneficial ownership of the second flat. In this regard, this court held that (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The concept of ‘eligibility’ is not a merely notional one. It does not turn on whether a person could conceivably apply for an HDB flat, considered abstractly. Instead, <span class="font-italic">the question must be whether the particular person could purchase the particular flat, and what conditions must be met before that purchase would be approved</span>. Any other view would diminish the limitations that have been clearly set out in the authorities. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for Maniam JC’s holding that s 51(10) would prevent even an otherwise eligible owner from obtaining an interest under a resulting or constructive trust if that person did not already have an interest in the flat in question (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation), this court observed that “this might go further than the existing authorities which have hitherto focused on ineligibility as the central consideration in determining whether s 51(10) … precluded a claim”. However, as it was not necessary to determine this issue, and given the plaintiffs’ ineligibility, this issue was expressly left open (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the Judgment, the Judge indicated that he was tentatively inclined to prefer the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA proposed in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>. The Judge provided two broad reasons for this view: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the focus on eligibility in the cases preceding <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span> – particularly <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>and <span class="font-italic">Koh Cheong Heng</span> – was not conclusive of whether s 51(10) <span class="font-italic">should</span> bear such an interpretation. This was because those cases did not involve situations where the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">did not already have an interest in the </span><span class="font-italic">disputed HDB property</span>, but was otherwise eligible to own the property (see the Judgment at [152]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, statutory interpretation must accord primacy to the text of s 51(10), which bars <span class="font-italic">anyone</span> from becoming entitled to any interest in HDB property under a constructive or resulting trust, without drawing any distinction between eligible and ineligible persons. To read s 51(10) as applying only to <span class="font-italic">ineligible</span> persons would require the phrase “entitled to … any interest in such property” to mean “entitled <span class="font-italic">to become eligible to own </span>an interest in such property” [emphasis in original], or the term “entitled” to be equated with “eligible to own”. This would stretch the words of s 51(10) “beyond their natural and ordinary meaning” (see the Judgment at [153]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The most recent decision on s 51(10) of the HDA is that of the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin (as the sole executrix of the estate of Lim Guan Heong, deceased) v Lim Sai Ing Peggy </span>[2021] SGHC(A) 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span>”). The parties’ father was initially the sole registered proprietor of an HDB flat, but the respondent subsequently became registered as a joint tenant of the flat. Upon their father’s death, the legal title to the flat devolved to the respondent pursuant to the right of survivorship. The applicant sought a declaration that the respondent held the flat on trust for their late father’s estate. In response, the respondent argued that any trust in respect of the flat would be prohibited under ss 51(8) or 51(9) of the HDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Appellate Division first found that the respondent held the flat on resulting trust for her father’s estate, as the parties’ father had not intended to gift a beneficial interest in the flat to her (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>at [23]–[24]). Section 51(10) of the HDA, rather than ss 51(8) and 51(9), was applicable because the trust was in the nature of a resulting trust, not an express trust. Nevertheless, the resulting trust did not contravene s 51(10) because, regardless of which interpretation of s 51(10) was adopted, it was “clear that … s 51(10) does not extend to situations where the person in whose favour the trust arises <span class="font-italic">already </span>has an interest in the flat in question” [emphasis in original] and thus cannot be said to have “become entitled” to an interest in the flat by virtue of a resulting or constructive trust. As the parties’ father had already possessed an interest in the flat before the respondent became a registered joint tenant, he did not “become entitled” to an interest in the flat by virtue of the resulting trust in his favour (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>at [28]). Thus, the declaration of trust was granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The preferable interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Having surveyed the existing case law on the interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA and its predecessors, we come now to the central question of which interpretation should be preferred. Applying the well-established principles of purposive statutory interpretation set out by this court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37] and [54(c)], it is clear to us that <span class="font-italic">the Eligibility Interpretation</span> should be adopted. In addition to the points raised in the earlier case law regarding the purpose of s 51(10) of the HDA, the Eligibility Interpretation can <span class="font-italic">also</span> be justified based on the wording of s 51(10) itself, and the concerns raised in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>, the Judgment and <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin</span> can, in fact, be addressed within the framework of this particular interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Possible interpretations of s 51(10) of the HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 It will be clear from our overview of the case law that there are at least two possible interpretations of s 51(10) of the HDA: the Eligibility Interpretation and the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation, respectively. On the <span class="font-italic">Eligibility Interpretation</span>, s 51(10) would only bar <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>persons from becoming entitled to an interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust, regardless of whether such persons already have an interest in the HDB property in question. On the <span class="font-italic">Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation</span>, s 51(10) would bar <span class="font-italic">all </span>persons (including otherwise eligible persons) from becoming entitled to HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust <span class="font-italic">if they do not already have an interest in </span><span class="font-italic">the HDB property in question</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Central to the discomfort with the Eligibility Interpretation in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>and the Judgment is the concern that it strains the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used in s 51(10) of the HDA. This concern was shared by Mr Choo, who submitted that the “plain language” of s 51(10) was “dispositive” in answering the question of how it ought to be interpreted. In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [80], Maniam JC emphasised that s 51(10) states that “[n]o person shall become entitled”, not that “[n]o <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>person shall become entitled”. Maniam JC appears to have equated the phrase “become entitled” with the <span class="font-italic">acquisition of an interest</span> under a resulting or constructive trust (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [79]–[85]). Similarly, the Judge reasoned that s 51(10) did not use the wording “entitled <span class="font-italic">to become eligible to own</span>” an interest in HDB property, and remarked that the meaning of the term “entitled” could not be equated with the meaning of the term “eligible to own” without stretching the words of s 51(10) beyond their natural and ordinary meaning (see also [82(b)] above). On the natural reading of s 51(10), it could not be said that eligible persons did not “become entitled” to the HDB property because of the resulting or constructive trust (see the Judgment at [153]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 These difficulties identified by Maniam JC and the Judge arise from their implicit premise that the phrase “become entitled” must refer to the <span class="font-italic">acquisition of an interest</span> under a resulting or constructive trust. The Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation follows from this, such that s 51(10) would prevent any person from <span class="font-italic">acquiring an interest </span>in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust if that person <span class="font-italic">did not already have an</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic">interest </span>in the property in question. However, we do not, with respect, think that the phrase “become entitled” should be read so restrictively. On an ordinary reading of the word “entitled”, a person may be said to “become entitled” to an interest which he <span class="font-italic">could not</span> have obtained before (due to his or her ineligibility to obtain such an interest – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Eligibility Interpretation), <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">or</span> may “become entitled” to an interest which he <span class="font-italic">did not</span> have before (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation). We are therefore unable to agree with the Judge that reading the requirement of eligibility into s 51(10) would be stretching its words “beyond their natural and ordinary meaning”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The view that the Eligibility Interpretation is not only a possible but a <span class="font-italic">plausible </span>interpretation based on the text of s 51(10) is further supported by an examination of the provision in the broader statutory scheme of the HDA. The word “entitled” is used in several other provisions of the HDA without carrying the meaning of “having an interest in property” or “acquiring an interest in property”, and indeed is used in a sense much more closely correlated with the concept of eligibility. For example: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 47(1) provides that “[n]o person shall be <span class="font-italic">entitled to purchase</span>” [emphasis added] any HDB property if he, his spouse or any authorised occupier owns (or has recently owned) another property. Section 50A(1) provides that, notwithstanding s 47, the Minister may declare any body corporate “to be <span class="font-italic">entitled to purchase</span>” [emphasis added] any HDB property.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 65H(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides that, under certain circumstances, an owner of a flat may have a charge on the flat discharged and “shall be <span class="font-italic">entitled to a certificate of discharge</span>” [emphasis added] from the HDB. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Section 65P(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that, upon a publication of a particular notification, the reversion immediately expectant on certain leases shall vest in the HDB, and the HDB “shall have all <span class="font-italic">powers, rights and remedies</span> to which the approved developer as the reversioner was by law <span class="font-italic">entitled</span>” [emphasis added]. Section 65P(3) then provides that an approved developer whose land is the subject of such a notification “shall be <span class="font-italic">entitled to receive such compensation</span> as is agreed” with the HDB [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Most interestingly, s 65R(1) provides that a person shall not be “eligible” to purchase certain types of HDB property from an approved developer “if such person or his spouse is not <span class="font-italic">entitled to purchase</span>” any HDB property from the HDB or “ceases to be <span class="font-italic">entitled to be such a purchaser</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Thus, as was recently noted by Alvin Chen, “Entitlement and Eligibility – Regulating Trusts Over HDB Properties”, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Law Gazette</span> (January 2022), the word “entitled” in the statutory context of the HDA has “a unique meaning that is strongly linked to eligibility”, and “[d]issociating eligibility from entitlement under section 51(10) <span class="font-italic">only</span> does not appear to be justified” [emphasis added]. In our view, when the wording of s 51(10) is considered in the context of the HDA as a whole, the Eligibility Interpretation is an entirely tenable reading of that particular provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative purpose or object</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 With this in mind, we turn to consider the purpose of s 51(10) of the HDA. It is clear to us from the various Ministerial statements that have been made over the years in the Parliamentary debates (which we have excerpted at [58] and [67] above) that the purpose of s 51(10) is to prevent <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ineligible</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>persons from acquiring an entitlement to HDB property, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> to prevent <span class="font-italic">all persons without a </span><span class="font-italic">pre-existing interest </span>from doing so. When these Ministerial statements and the successive iterations of the HDA are viewed in their broader historical context, and when the particular character of HDB property is borne in mind, it becomes even more apparent to us that the Eligibility Interpretation is the most sensible approach to s 51(10).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As we have observed at [54] above, the true starting point in examining the history of ss 51(8)–51(10) of the HDA is the introduction of s 36E(4) of the 1959 Ordinance in 1964, by means of the 1964 Amendment Ordinance. Section 36E(4) was part of a series of provisions, introduced as the new Part IIIA of the 1959 Ordinance, governing the sale of flats, houses and other living accommodation. These included: s 36A, which empowered the HDB to sell any developed land or part thereof belonging to it; s 36B, which imposed restrictions as to purchase (by providing that “[n]o person shall be entitled to purchase more than one” HDB property); s 36D, which laid down implied conditions as to HDB flats, houses and other living accommodation (by providing that such property could not be sold, leased, mortgaged or disposed of without the HDB’s prior written consent); and s 36F, which dealt with the transmission of HDB property on the death of the owner (whose registration required the HDB’s written consent). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Although the 1964 Amendment Ordinance was passed only in November 1964, the amendments therein were deemed to have come into operation in February 1964 (see s 1 of the 1964 Amendment Ordinance). This was a highly significant time period in the history of the HDB: in February 1964, the Home Ownership Scheme was introduced, under which the HDB would build and offer affordably priced public housing flats for sale on 99-year leases (see Sock-Yong Phang, <span class="font-italic">Policy Innovations for Affordable Housing in Singapore: From Colony to Global City </span>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) (“Phang (2018)”) at p 29). This was a housing policy innovation with both political and economic advantages. In 1964, four years after the HDB was established, Singapore’s acute housing shortage had been alleviated sufficiently for the HDB to turn its attention to the issue of home <span class="font-italic">ownership</span>. The “basic objective” of the Home Ownership Scheme was “to encourage a property-owning democracy in Singapore, and to enable Singapore citizens in the lower middle income group to own their own homes” (see HDB, <span class="font-italic">Annual Report</span> (1964) at p 9). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The corollary of the latter aim was the need to ensure that the subsidised public housing provided by the HDB was made available to Singapore citizens who needed such housing the most. Thus, from the outset of the Home Ownership Scheme, the government was alive to the importance of putting in place various restrictions and eligibility conditions to prevent the scheme from being abused. As the then Minister for National Development, Mr Lim Kim San, explained (see State of Singapore, <span class="font-italic">Legislative Assembly </span><span class="font-italic">Debates, Official Report </span>(4 November 1964) vol 23 at cols 179–181):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Bill is to fulfil [the] Government’s promise to provide opportunities for the middle and lower income group to own homes. … <span class="font-italic">We have reached the stage where we can offer accommodation to any citizen of Singapore who is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">eligible</span><span class="font-italic"> to a house if he is not too choosey</span>. However, there are quite a number of people with low income who want to, and should be encouraged to, own their homes too. Unfortunately the flats and houses built by private developers are priced beyond their means. We have therefore now started a scheme whereby <span class="font-italic">two- and three-room flats are sold on instalment at the subsidized prices</span> of $4,900 and $6,200 respectively. … <span class="font-italic">In putting up this scheme </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is our intention to see that no abuse arises out of it</span><span class="font-italic">. Therefore, certain </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conditions and regulations</span><span class="font-italic"> have to be made pertaining to the sale of these flats. </span>There are enough provisions in this Bill to prevent these flats which are sold on instalments from falling into the hands of speculators and profiteers. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The flats are to be sold only to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">purchasers who wish to buy a house for their own occupation.</span> … Under this Bill, a person is not entitled to purchase more than one flat, and if he does so, he contravenes the Ordinance, and on conviction will be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a fine not exceeding $2,000, or to both fine and imprisonment.

As a consequence of the overwhelming response to the Home Ownership Scheme, there were long waiting lists for prospective homeowners. During this period in the 1960s and 1970s, the HDB imposed stringent eligibility conditions and restrictions on the resale of HDB flats (see Phang (2018) at pp 99–100 and Cassy Xie Kaixi, “Law and Family in the Formation of Modern Singapore” in <span class="font-italic">Encounters with Singapore Legal History: Essays in Memory of Geoffrey Wilson Bartholomew </span>(Kevin YL Tan &amp; Michael Hor, eds) (Singapore Journal of Legal Studies, 2009) ch 9 (“Xie (2009)”) at p 266). The categories of persons eligible for HDB housing were expanded in 1972 so as to include, for instance, non-citizen spouses of deceased Singapore citizens, with their children, and orphans who could form a family group with other persons (see Xie (2009) at p 267). At the same time, in the 1970s, restrictions on eligibility arising from the ownership of private property were imposed in line with the policy imperative of ensuring that subsidised public housing was allocated to those who needed it (because they did not or could not own other property) and preventing property owners from taking advantage of subsidised public housing for their personal gain: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(20 March 1974) vol 33 at col 434 (Mr E W Barker, Minister for Law and National Development) and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(27 May 1977) vol 37 at col 19 (Dr Tan Eng Liang, Senior Minister of State for National Development). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It is worth noting that s 44(4) of the 1970 HDA, which was in force during this time, contained an <span class="font-italic">absolute </span>bar on the creation of <span class="font-italic">any</span> trust in respect of HDB property by the owner thereof. Such trusts were automatically “null and void” and “incapable of being enforced by any court”. The position changed in 1984, when s 44(4) was amended to allow the creation of trusts <span class="font-italic">with the prior written approval of </span><span class="font-italic">the HDB</span>. At the Second Reading of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill in August 1984, by which s 44(4) of the 1970 HDA was replaced by ss 44(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 44(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1985 HDA (which were later renumbered as ss 51(4) and 51(5) of the 1997 HDA and, later, as ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA), Mr Teh explained that this change in legislative policy arose from the need for the HDB to permit the creation of trusts for “legitimate reasons”. This portion of Mr Teh’s speech, which was considered by the court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>at [18] and is excerpted at [58] above, is worth setting out again here (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(24 August 1984) vol 44 at col 2025): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the Act now stands, no trust in any form can be created in respect of an HDB dwelling or property. <span class="font-italic">The original intention of this provision was to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prevent abuse by persons not eligible for </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">HDB flats from purchasing a flat in the name of nominees</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Over the years, however, <span class="font-italic">there has been </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">increasing need for </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the HDB to permit the creation of trusts for legitimate reasons</span>. For example, it is necessary to empower trustees to hold flats for minor children who are citizens in the event of death of the lessee parent, and where the surviving parent is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident and therefore not eligible to assume ownership of the flat. Similarly, in some cases of legal separation or divorce, flats have to be held in trust for minor children until they reach the age of 21 years. <span class="font-italic">Clause</span><span class="font-italic"> 3 of this Amendment Bill, therefore, seeks to allow a trust to be created in respect of an HDB dwelling provided such trust is approved by the Board. </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the same Parliamentary session, however, Mr Teh reiterated the continuing importance of preventing abuse of the privilege of subsidised public housing (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(24 August 1984) vol 44 at cols 2056–2057):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the broader national context, the HDB has to look after the interests of the majority of our citizens and therefore <span class="font-italic">it is essential for HDB to institute rules and regulations to govern these flats, to prevent people from abusing the flats</span>. … [I]t is essential that <span class="font-italic">HDB must have rules and regulations to prevent the abuse of the flats</span>. … At this stage, I would like to say that because of the national interest and that 80% of our population are living in HDB estates, it is essential that the Government and HDB continue to study the needs of residents in this ever-changing social environment. Rules and regulations will continue to be made and implemented as a strong deterrent to those who act against the interests of the HDB flat-dwellers because they represent the majority. Those people who misuse their flats represent only a minority. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We must prevent people from abusing the privilege of subsidized public housing.</span> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the housing shortage eased and households sought to upgrade their housing or change their location, efforts were made towards deregulation in order to facilitate the development of an HDB resale market. Resale regulations on the eligibility of buyers were amended to facilitate household mobility within the HDB sector, as well as between the HDB sector and the private sector (see Phang (2018) at p 100). Even then, however, the principle that public housing was for owner-occupation (and not for speculation or investment) was emphasised by Parliamentarians, and continued to be reiterated in the 2000s. For example, the following remarks were made by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, the then Minister of State for National Development, in 1992 (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(16 November 1992) vol 60 at cols 308–309): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n land-scarce Singapore, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">public housing has to be strictly for owner-occupation</span>. … We cannot allow private property owners to purchase HDB flats without residing in the flats. <span class="font-italic">This will only encourage speculative demand for public housing, and deprive those who are in real need of public housing from owning </span><span class="font-italic">HDB flats.

If you allow HDB flats to be open for purely investment purposes, I think the demand will be very much greater than today. Today, we must build flats for Singaporeans who want to reside in HDB flats. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Another example may be found in the speech by the then Minister for National Development, Mr Mah, at the Second Reading of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 35/2002), where he stressed that “the Government [was] not abandoning the principle of long-term owner occupation, or the social objectives of public housing” and that public housing was not for speculation or investment (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(31 October 2002) vol 75 at cols 1374 and 1395). It should be noted that the relevant regulations came to be relaxed to permit, for example, the increased sub-letting of HDB flats (see, for example, Phang (2018) at pp 102–103). Nevertheless, in our judgment, this does not in any way detract from the centrality of <span class="font-italic">eligibility </span>to the regulatory scheme of the HDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In this context, legislation has served an important <span class="font-italic">facilitative </span>function in “provid[ing] the necessary legal framework for the bureaucracy in general and the various statutory boards in particular to implement the public housing programme” (see Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">The Development of Singapore Law: Historical and Socio-Legal Perspectives </span>(Butterworths, 1990) at p 330). Tight eligibility conditions for the acquisition of HDB property have helped to optimise the use of Singapore’s limited land resources, keep housing affordable, and support the government’s prevailing social and economic policies. For example, other than helping to ensure that the benefits of subsidised public housing were channelled to those who genuinely needed them, eligibility conditions have also “played an important part in supporting the government’s population and family planning policies” (see Xie (2009) at p 266) over the years, such as through the criterion of a “family nucleus”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 It is against this background that the eventual introduction of s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA (which would later become s 51(10) of the HDA) must be viewed. In 2005, during the Second Reading of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 19/2005) which inserted s 51(6) into the 2004 HDA, Mr Mah explained that the new provision was targeted towards preventing <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>persons from becoming entitled to own HDB flats (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(15 August 2005) vol 80 at col 1259). Again, although these remarks have been excerpted at [67] above, they are worth repeating here: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 51 to make it clear that, <span class="font-italic">in addition to prohibiting the voluntary creation of trusts over an </span><span class="font-italic">HDB flat, the [2004 HDA] also prohibits any person from becoming entitled to a [</span>sic<span class="font-italic">]</span><span class="font-italic"> HDB flat under a resulting trust or constructive trust</span>. <span class="font-italic">This will help to prevent a situation where a person who is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ineligible</span><span class="font-italic"> to own an </span><span class="font-italic">HDB flat may become entitled to own one</span>, for example, by paying the purchase price of the flat on behalf of the owner. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 These Parliamentary statements are “clear and unequivocal”, “disclose the mischief targeted by the enactment or the legislative intention lying behind any ambiguous or obscure words” and are “directed to the very point in question” (which, as this court noted in <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [52], are necessary for such Parliamentary statements to be of real use). They reveal that the specific legislative intent undergirding the introduction of s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA, and thereafter s 51(10) of the HDA, was to prevent persons who were <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ineligibl</span><span class="font-weight-bold">e</span> to own HDB flats from becoming entitled to such property under a resulting or constructive trust, when such persons would not have been permitted to own an HDB flat directly or outright. This view of Parliament’s intention is consistent with the language of s 51(10) and its statutory context, as well as the observations made by the courts over the years (as set out at [59(a)], [61], [63(a)], [68], [72]–[74] and [75] above). More holistically, a consideration of the broader contextual developments and legislative history of s 51 of the HDA reveals that Parliament’s consistent policy concern, reiterated on numerous occasions since the inception of the Home Ownership Scheme in 1964, was to prevent the abuse of the privilege of subsidised public housing by those who, under the prevailing regulatory schemes, were <span class="font-italic">ineligible</span> to enjoy the benefits of such subsidised public housing, and yet might nevertheless become entitled to an interest in such property under a trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 On this view of Parliament’s intention behind s 51(10) of the HDA, it is evident that the Eligibility Interpretation better furthers its legislative purpose. Under the Eligibility Interpretation, the critical issue is whether the person in question is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">eligible or ineligible</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>to acquire the HDB property in question. The question of whether an eligible person has a pre-existing interest in the property is immaterial, except in so far as it may <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">evidence</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>his eligibility. This point appears to have been contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [10], where Menon JC stated that s 51(10) “was not intended to have any application where the parties concerned were already entitled to some interest in the property <span class="font-italic">and therefore no issue could arise as to their eligibility to such entitlement</span>” [emphasis added]. By directing the inquiry specifically towards the question of eligibility, the first interpretation dovetails neatly with Parliament’s object of preventing ineligible persons from becoming entitled to HDB property and thereby circumventing the regulatory restrictions imposed by the HDB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 At this juncture, it is apposite for us to address the Appellate Division’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>at [28] that, on either interpretation of s 51(10), it “does not extend to situations where the person in whose favour the trust arises <span class="font-italic">already </span>has an interest in the flat in question” [emphasis in original]. This is subtly different from the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation: under the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation, s 51(10) would bar the claim of any person who does not already have an interest in the HDB property, whereas the Appellate Division in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>was applying the converse proposition that a claim by a person who already <span class="font-italic">has</span> an interest in the property would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be barred by s 51(10). In our judgment, the Appellate Division’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Hin </span>can be reconciled with the Eligibility Interpretation in the following manner. If a party<span class="font-italic"> </span>already has an interest in the disputed HDB property, this serves as an indicium of that party’s eligibility to acquire such an interest. In those circumstances, to borrow Menon JC’s words in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [10], “no issue could arise as to their eligibility to such entitlement”. More precisely, applying the approach to “eligibility” set out in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [14], the fact that the person has already acquired an interest would show that “the particular person could purchase the particular flat” and that the necessary conditions for the purchase to be approved have, as a matter of fact, been met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 We deal here with the appellant’s submission that the Eligibility Interpretation of s 51(10) would permit eligible claimants asserting a resulting or constructive trust to circumvent the requirement to seek the HDB’s approval under ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA. In our view, this does not follow. Sections 51(8) and 51(9) apply when a trust is purportedly “created” in respect of HDB property without the HDB’s written approval. The cases are clear that ss 51(8) and 51(9) are not limited to express trusts; they also apply when a party intentionally creates a nominee arrangement whereby a trust (constructive or resulting) arises in his favour to circumvent the HDA’s provisions (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kuen </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Sitiawah</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Neo </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Tan </span>[17]–[18]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian </span>at [8]; and <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [11]). Thus, even on the Eligibility Interpretation of s 51(10), ss 51(8) and 51(9) would still operate to prevent the intentional circumvention of the HDA’s requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In contrast to the Eligibility Interpretation, the critical issue under the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation is whether the person in question <span class="font-italic">already has an interest in </span><span class="font-italic">the HDB property in question</span>. On this approach, s 51(10) would apply <span class="font-italic">regardless of the person’s eligibility</span> to acquire the property. This would not support Parliament’s articulated object of preventing <span class="font-italic">ineligible</span> persons from becoming entitled to HDB property. On the contrary, by applying to all persons regardless of eligibility, the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation would be over-inclusive, depriving even <span class="font-italic">eligible</span> beneficial owners from asserting their interests in HDB property even where they have <span class="font-italic">not</span> purported to “create” the trust through some “connivance” (see<span class="font-italic"> Tan Chui Lian </span>at [8]) or intentional nominee arrangement (see<span class="font-italic"> Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [11]) which would be caught by ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA. This is aptly illustrated by the facts of the present case, where – even though there is no evidence of any attempt by the respondents to circumvent any regulatory restrictions imposed by the HDB – s 51(10) would, on the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation, operate to bar their claim to a beneficial interest in the Property simply because they did not have a pre-existing interest in the same (see the Judgment at [159]). It is not clear which of the HDB’s policies (if any) this would serve to uphold, or whether Parliament would have intended such an outcome.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Indeed, a further problem with the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation is that it would appear to preclude all claims under a resulting or constructive trust by any person who does not already have a <span class="font-italic">legal </span>interest in the property as a registered proprietor. This is implicit in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>at [84] and the Judgment at [159]. The practical effect of this interpretation is that s 51(10) would allow a claim to a resulting or constructive trust over an HDB property only in cases where both parties are already <span class="font-italic">registered owners</span> of the property under a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, and one party seeks to argue that their respective beneficial shares of the property should not follow the proportions of their legal shares. In our view, there is no basis in the legislative purpose of s 51(10) for circumscribing the operation of resulting or constructive trusts over HDB property this narrowly. Whereas the focus on <span class="font-italic">eligibility</span> as the touchstone has been a recurring motif in the Parliamentary material, at no stage in the history of the HDA does there appear to have been any particular concern that the public housing scheme might be abused by <span class="font-italic">eligible </span><span class="font-italic">but unregistered beneficial owners</span> claiming to have acquired equitable interests in HDB property under the ordinary principles of trusts law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 To conclude on this point, on the analysis above, it is clear to us that the Eligibility Interpretation should be preferred based on a purposive interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 58(11) of the 2020 HDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 After the issuance of the Judgment and the filing of the appeal, the Housing and Development Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the 2020 HDA”) came into effect on 31 December 2021. This is the version of the HDA presently in force. Section 51(10) of the HDA has now been renumbered as s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA, and “shall become entitled” in s 51(10) has been replaced with “is entitled” in s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA. Given that s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA is not the version of the legislation applicable to the facts of the present appeal, it is not necessary for us to express a conclusive view on how it should be interpreted and applied. Nevertheless, we express an indicative view on s 58(11) for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In view of the general legislative drafting policy behind the 2020 Revised Editions of minimising the use of the word “shall” and instead using “is” to denote declaratory provisions (Law Revision Unit, Legislation Division, Attorney-General’s Chambers, <span class="font-italic">Guide to the</span><span class="font-italic"> 2020 Revised Edition of Acts </span>(31 December 2021) at p xii), and given that these specific amendments were not debated in Parliament, it seems to us that these amendments are purely editorial in nature, and cannot be taken to have changed the substantive meaning or effect of s 51(10) of the HDA (on the Eligibility Interpretation that we have adopted). Reference may also be made to the speech made by the Attorney-General, Mr Lucien Wong SC, at the Opening of the Legal Year 2022, wherein he stated that the 2020 Revised Editions did not change the meaning of the legislation (see “Opening of the Legal Year 2022” (10 January 2022) at para 31, <https: default-source="" docs="" newsroom-doucments="" oly-2022---address-by-the-honourable-attorney-general.pdf="" speeches="" www-agc-gov-sg-admin.cwp.sg=""> (accessed 16 March 2022)). These amendments in the 2020 HDA also do not shed any light on how the earlier s 51(10) should be interpreted. However, it should be highlighted that the new wording of s 58(11) may not accommodate <span class="font-italic">either </span>of the existing interpretations of s 51(10) of the HDA – both of which have rested in part on the phrase “<span class="font-italic">become</span> entitled” [emphasis added] – as comfortably.</https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In our view, for the reasons set out in our analysis above, the Eligibility Interpretation should apply equally to s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA, such that the provision would operate to bar only <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>persons from holding an interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust. Significantly, the amendments in s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA make no attempt to effect a legislative reversal of the Eligibility Interpretation, which – until <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>– had been consistently adopted and applied by the courts since the 2006 decision of Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in respect of s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA.

However, as noted at [71] above, the only real difference between s 51(6) of the 2004 HDA and s 51(10) of the HDA is the addition of the words “or arising”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Parliament’s treatment of the courts’ decisions adopting the Eligibility Interpretation over the years stands in contrast to its legislative reversals of other decisions in various domains.

The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 1/1992) was therefore introduced to “amend the Legal Profession Act to clarify the position of foreign lawyers appearing in arbitration proceedings”, by “insert[ing] a new s 34A to provide that the exclusive right of practising Singapore advocates and solicitors to practise law and act as an agent in legal proceedings will not apply to arbitration where the law applicable to the dispute is foreign law” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(27 February 1992) vol 59<span class="font-italic"> </span>at cols 424–425 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Law)).

During the Second Reading of the Bill, it was stated that this clarificatory amendment was necessary because the “relevant court decision” had left it “debatable in each case whether merely telling a person that he is bound to tell the truth amounts to an inducement”. This clarification was, however, “achieved through a substantive change” to the legislation (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 March 2018) vol 94 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Law)).

At the Second Reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 27/2018), it was observed that the effect of the <span class="font-italic">Diablo </span>decision “[gave] rise to several practical difficulties for the shipping industry”, as compliance with s 131 of the Companies Act in relation to shipowners’ liens would be “particularly burdensome” for the shipping industry. The Bill therefore exempted shipowners’ liens from the registration requirements under s 131 of the Companies Act while maintaining the court’s characterisation of such liens as charges in <span class="font-italic">Diablo</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(6 August 2018) vol 94 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Second Minister for Finance)). Subsequently, s 2 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 35 of 2018) amended s 131 of the Companies Act by inserting new subsections (3AB) and (3AC) (which dealt specifically with shipowners’ liens) to this effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 We would therefore have adopted the same interpretation of s 58(11) of the 2020 HDA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Eligibility Interpretation) if this provision had been directly before us in the present appeal. In our view, the amendments in s 58(11) did not alter the substantive effect of s 51(10) of the HDA. On the contrary, the fact that s 58(11) is the latest in a series of legislative amendments to the HDA which have made no attempt to reverse the effect of the courts’ adoption of the Eligibility Interpretation lends further support to our view that this is indeed the correct interpretation of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the Eligibility Interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the proceedings below, there was no dispute between the parties regarding the respondents’ eligibility to own the Property, and the Judge thus accepted as an undisputed fact that the respondents were eligible (see the Judgment at [157]–[158]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The appellant, however, seeks to persuade us on appeal that the respondents’ claim should still fail because they have not shown why they would be eligible to own the Property. Mr Choo submitted at the hearing that the “gatekeeper of eligibility” had to be the HDB, and that eligibility could not simply be asserted by counsel and “accepted as an evidential fact” by the Judge when the appellant did not respond to this assertion of eligibility. As we stressed to Mr Choo, this submission is a non-starter because the issue of the respondents’ eligibility to own the Property was not in dispute in the proceedings below. It was incumbent on the appellant, as the party seeking to rely on s 51(10) of the HDA to argue that the respondents’ claim was barred, to adduce some evidence of the respondents’ ineligibility to own the Property. The appellant has entirely failed to do this, and indeed did not even challenge the respondents’ assertion as to their eligibility before the Judge. In these circumstances, we do not see any basis for disturbing the Judge’s factual finding that the respondents were indeed eligible persons. Nor do this court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Kieuh Huat (CA) </span>at [14] (set out at [80] above), which pertain to the fact-specific nature of the eligibility inquiry, assist the appellant. It bears emphasis that the Judge found as a fact that the respondents were eligible to own the Property, and the appellant has advanced no positive argument or evidence to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The appellant further submits that the HDB’s consent is required to fulfil the requirement of eligibility, because – in accordance with ss 50(1) and 47(8) of the HDA – any sale, lease, mortgage or disposal of HDB property requires the HDB’s consent. However, s 50(1) applies where HDB property is <span class="font-italic">sold, leased, mortgaged or disposed of</span> without the prior written consent of the HDB, while s 47(8) allows the HDB to sell or lease property to any person notwithstanding that that person has (with the HDB’s prior written consent) purchased or acquired commercial property below a particular value, for business purposes. Neither provision applies in the present case, where the issue is whether the respondents have acquired a beneficial interest in the Property under a common intention constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Since the appellant has given us no reason to question the Judge’s factual finding that the respondents are eligible to own the Property, s 51(10) of the HDA (on the Eligibility Interpretation) does not operate to bar their claim under the common intention constructive trust to each have a one-sixth beneficial share of the Property and its sale proceeds. The respondents are therefore straightforwardly entitled to the relief sought in the proceedings below, including the orders eventually granted by the Judge for the sale of the Property and for the sale proceeds to be divided equally among the Ong siblings (at [193]–[194] of the Judgment). We affirm the Judge’s decision and order of sale, and dismiss the appeal, on this basis.<span style="color: rgba(0,176,80,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s reasoning in support of granting an order of sale </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 On the Eligibility Interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA which we have adopted, it is not strictly necessary to consider whether it remains open to the court to make an order of sale in spite of s 51(10), which we have held does <span class="font-italic">not </span>bar the respondents’ claim for relief. Nevertheless, as this formed a significant part of the Judge’s decision, we think it necessary to express our views on the basis for the Judge’s order that the appellant sell the Property within 12 months and distribute the net sale proceeds equally among the Ong siblings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Notwithstanding his preference for the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation, the Judge found that it would be appropriate to order the sale of the Property and the equal division of its sale proceeds among the Ong siblings on <span class="font-italic">either </span>interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA (see the Judgment at [193]). In respect of the basis for such an order under the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation, the Judge reasoned as follows (at [181]–[192] of the Judgment): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a common intention constructive trust arose over the Property but, owing to the operation of s 51(10) of the HDA (on the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation), the court could not grant a declaration that each respondent was entitled to a one-sixth beneficial interest in the Property or order the sale of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, given the parties’ common intention that the Property was intended to be a “retirement fund” for them and that a common intention constructive trust would arise over the sale proceeds if the Property was sold (under which they would each have been entitled to equal beneficial shares), “an equity” arose in the respondents’ favour in relation to the Property which compelled the appellant to act in a manner consistent with that common intention. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To satisfy this equity, it was necessary and expedient to order the appellant to sell the Property and divide the sale proceeds in equal one-sixth shares between the parties. While the Judge recognised that a common intention constructive trust is an institutional constructive trust and is “a constructive trust in the proprietary sense”, such that “a plaintiff’s successful claim of a common intention constructive trust immediately and automatically establishes a beneficial interest in the property”, the Judge opined that this did not preclude an equity from arising from a common intention constructive trust. The expression “an equity” was here being used in the “broader and less precise sense to refer to any entitlement or obligation … of which a court of equity will take cognizance”. Such an equity could arise from the “actual infringement of one of equity’s standards of conduct” or a “breach of an equitable obligation”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As the parties intended that there be a common intention constructive trust over the Property, but s 51(10) of the HDA (on the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation) prevented the trust from operating in such a manner as to allow the court to declare that the respondents were entitled to individual shares in the Property, “an equity [arose] to affect the conscience of the [appellant] to honour and give effect to this common intention constructive trust”. On the “unique” facts of this particular case, the minimum that was necessary to satisfy this equity was to grant an order of sale in respect of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) This equity, in the Judge’s view, provided a substantive legal basis to order the sale of the Property in the exercise of the court’s power under s 18(2) read with para 2 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) or O 31 r 1 of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 With respect, we disagree with the Judge’s reasoning on this point. In our view, there was no legal basis for the Judge to find that the parties’ common intention gave rise to a freestanding equity sufficient to found an order of sale in respect of the Property. This is not a recognised equitable right, obligation or doctrine, and to apply the concept of an “equity” in this manner would stretch the existing jurisprudence too far. Although the Judge made reference to several authorities, these do not, on a closer reading, lend support to the Judge’s approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For instance, the article by Joseph Campbell, “When and Why a Bribe is Held on a Constructive Trust: The Method of Reasoning Towards an Equitable Remedy” (2015) 39(3) Australian Bar Review 320 (cited at [187] of the Judgment) concerns a completely different situation where a fiduciary agent receives a bribe in breach of his fiduciary obligations. Similarly, the excerpt from Denis Browne, <span class="font-italic">Ashburner’s Principles of Equity </span>(Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1933) (also cited in the Judgment at [187]) speaks of the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery and the use of the term “an equity” in that context. It does not represent the modern-day jurisprudence in Singapore on equity and trusts law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The same may be said of the Australian cases cited by the Judge. <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth of Australia v </span><span class="font-italic">Verwayen </span>(1990) 95 ALR 321 (“<span class="font-italic">Verwayen</span>”) (cited at [188] of the Judgment) was a decision of the High Court of Australia on estoppel by conduct. In that case, the question was whether a party was estopped from contesting the issue of liability when it had previously taken the position that it would not do so. In that context, Deane J explained that while a promissory estoppel is not “an equity” in the “narrow sense” because it does not give rise to “an immediate right to positive equitable relief”, it is “an equity” in “a broader and less precise sense” as it is an “entitlement or obligation (the equities) of which a court of equity will take cognisance”. As examples of such “equities”, Deane J referred to the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, delay and set-off (see <span class="font-italic">Verwayen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 348–349). However, these are <span class="font-italic">established </span>equitable doctrines, unlike the proposition here (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that in cases involving a common intention constructive trust, the parties’ common intention can give rise to a standalone equity which can provide the substantive legal basis for an order of sale). Thus, <span class="font-italic">Verwayen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>offers very limited support (if any) for the order eventually made by the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In a similar vein, the Federal Court of Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">Parianos</span><span class="font-italic"> v Melluish (as trustee for the estate of the late George Parianos</span>) (2003) 30 Fam LR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Parianos</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(also cited at [188] of the Judgment) concerned a wife’s claim that her late husband held his interest in a certain property on constructive trust for her. Jacobson J held that it was appropriate to impose a constructive trust in the wife’s favour in the circumstances of this case, in view of the parties’ inferred common intention (see <span class="font-italic">Parianos</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]). Having decided that, Jacobson J then considered the further issue of whether the wife’s equitable interest in the property stood outside the husband’s bankruptcy and was therefore unavailable for distribution among his creditors. It was in this context that Jacobson J opined that, while the facts “create[d] a personal equity between the parties which may be defeated by competing claims”, this personal equity was not defeated by the bankruptcy (see <span class="font-italic">Parianos</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61]). In our view, it is clear that Jacobson J did not mean that there was a freestanding “personal equity” which could be vindicated apart from the imposition of the constructive trust, as the Judge appeared to suggest at [188] of the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 We therefore have considerable reservations about the <span class="font-italic">basis</span> on which the Judge ordered the appellant to sell the Property and divide the net sale proceeds equally among the Ong siblings under the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation. Nevertheless, given our decision on the effect of s 51(10) of the HDA (properly interpreted) on the respondents’ claim (see [117] above), we do not need to arrive at a definitive conclusion on this point in the present appeal beyond our observations above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal, although we adopt the Eligibility Interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA and reject the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation which was preferred by the Judge in the court below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In so far as the costs of the appeal are concerned, we order the appellant to pay $50,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the respondents.

The appellant was the sole registered owner of a two-storey Housing &amp; Development Board (“HDB”) shophouse (“the Property”). The respondents commenced proceedings against the appellant, seeking (among other things) an order that the Property be sold and the sale proceeds divided equally among the six siblings. The respondents claimed that the Property was a family asset held by the appellant on a common intention constructive trust for each of the siblings, who were entitled to equal beneficial shares.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The High Court judge below (“the Judge”) found that the Property and its sale proceeds were subject to a common intention constructive trust in favour of the siblings as beneficial owners in six equal shares. The Judge found that, although there was no direct evidence that the siblings and their mother had collectively agreed that the Property should be held by the appellant on trust for the siblings at the time when the HDB offered the Property for sale to the appellant, there was sufficient evidence which showed that the Property was intended to be acquired as a family asset for the family as a whole. Furthermore, there was a common intention that the Property would eventually be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally to assist in the siblings’ retirement. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The Judge went on to consider the effect of s 51(10) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the HDA”), which provides that “[n]o person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever created or arising”. The proper interpretation of this provision and its predecessors had been considered on numerous occasions, and since <span class="font-italic">Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew Eng </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 265, the consistent position adopted in the case law had been that the provision only bars <span class="font-italic">ineligible </span>persons from becoming entitled to any interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust (“the Eligibility Interpretation”). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Kieuh Huat and another v Lim Teck Leng and another </span>[2020] SGHC 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>”), however, a different interpretation had been proposed – that s 51(10) of the HDA bars <span class="font-italic">all </span>persons (including eligible persons) from becoming entitled to an interest in HDB property under a resulting or constructive trust <span class="font-italic">if they do not already have an entitlement to the property in question </span>(“the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation”). The Judge expressed a tentative preference for the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation. Applying that interpretation, the Judge held that s 51(10) of the HDA barred the respondents from becoming entitled to a beneficial interest in the Property under the common intention constructive trust (or any resulting trust) as they were not registered owners of the Property. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Nevertheless, the Judge took the view that an “equity” arose in the respondents’ favour in relation to the Property which compelled the appellant to act in a manner consistent with the parties’ common intention that they had equal beneficial shares in the Property and its sale proceeds. To satisfy that equity, the Judge considered it necessary and expedient to order that the Property be sold by the appellant within 12 months and that the net sale proceeds be divided among the Ong siblings in equal one-sixth shares.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Common intention constructive trust</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Judge found that the parties had shared a common intention to acquire the Property as an income-generating family asset, which would eventually be sold and the sale proceeds shared equally to provide a “retirement fund” for each of them. The Judge concluded that an assessment of the totality of the evidence supported the respondents’ case that the Property and its sale proceeds were subject to a common intention constructive trust where the true beneficial owners were the respondents and the appellant in six equal shares. The appellant had provided no basis for disturbing the Judge’s findings and conclusion on this point, which were arrived at after a thorough consideration of the facts and the parties’ evidence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">32]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The court rejected the appellant’s submission that the respondents’ inability to show that they had made direct financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property was fatal to their common intention constructive trust claim. On the facts, the use of earnings from a business which belonged to all the siblings in equal shares to pay the mortgage instalments for the Property sufficed to show the respondents’ direct financial contribution to the purchase of the Property. Furthermore, given that <span class="font-italic">neither</span> the appellant <span class="font-italic">nor</span> the respondents could be said to have made any direct financial contributions towards the purchase price of the Property in the typical manner, the Judge was justified in inferring <span class="font-italic">from the</span> <span class="font-italic">totality of the evidence</span> that the parties’ common intention was for each of them to have an equal beneficial share in the Property and its sale proceeds: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[33] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">36]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 There was sufficient detrimental reliance by the respondents to found their common intention constructive trust claim. Not only had the respondents taken meagre salaries from the business for 28 years and performed carpentry work for free, they had also consented to the earnings from the business (which belonged beneficially to all of them) being used to pay the mortgage instalments for the Property. Given the conceptual differences between proprietary estoppel and common intention constructive trusts, the Judge’s observation that there was no detrimental reliance for the purposes of proprietary estoppel did not necessarily mean that there was no detrimental reliance for the purposes of the common intention constructive trust: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">41]</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Doctrine of laches</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 There was no basis for the doctrine of laches to bar the respondents’ claim. Around late 2017 to early 2018, the appellant began to assert sole beneficial ownership of the Property and began to take active steps to exclude the respondents from the Property. The proceedings in the suit were commenced by the respondents several months later, on 27 December 2018. In these circumstances, it could not be said that there had been a substantial lapse of time, and these facts provided a reasonable explanation for the respondents asserting their beneficial interest in the Property only after the parties’ mother had passed on. Further, there were no circumstances that would make it practically unjust for the respondents to be granted a remedy, particularly because the parties’ mother was not the only witness who could give evidence on the parties’ common intention regarding the Property: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[45] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">49]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 51(10) of the HDA</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Having considered the language of s 51(10) of the HDA, its legislative history and evolution, as well as the broader contextual and historical developments in which it had to be situated, the court endorsed the Eligibility Interpretation and rejected the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation proposed in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kieuh Huat (HC)</span>: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 While the origin of ss 51(8)–51(10) of the HDA has tended to be traced back to s 44(4) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 271, 1970 Rev Ed), the very first iteration of what later became s 51(9) of the HDA was s 36E(4) of the Housing and Development Ordinance 1959 (No 11 of 1959), which was introduced in 1964 by the Housing and Development (Amendment) Ordinance 1964 (No 10 of 1964): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 On a purposive interpretation of s 51(10) of the HDA, it was clear that the<span class="font-italic"> </span>Eligibility Interpretation should be adopted. Central to the discomfort with the Eligibility Interpretation in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kieuh Huat (HC) </span>and the Judge’s decision was the concern that it strained the natural and ordinary meaning of the words of s 51(10). However, on an ordinary reading of the word “entitled”, a person might be said to “become entitled” to an interest which he <span class="font-italic">could not</span> have obtained before (due to his or her <span class="font-italic">ineligibility</span> to obtain such an interest), <span class="font-italic">or</span> might “become entitled” to an interest which he <span class="font-italic">did not</span> have before. Reading the requirement of eligibility into s 51(10) would therefore not stretch its words beyond their natural and ordinary meaning. The view that the Eligibility Interpretation was a <span class="font-italic">plausible </span>interpretation of s 51(10) was further supported by the broader statutory scheme. The word “entitled” was used in several other HDA provisions without carrying the meaning of “having an interest in property” or “acquiring an interest in property”, and indeed was used in a sense much more closely correlated with the concept of <span class="font-italic">eligibility</span>: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span> and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [87]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The various Parliamentary statements that had been made over the years revealed that the specific legislative intent behind s 51(10) of the HDA was to prevent persons who were <span class="font-italic">ineligibl</span>e to own HDB flats from becoming entitled to such property under a resulting or constructive trust, when such persons would not have been permitted to own an HDB flat directly or outright – and not to prevent <span class="font-italic">all persons without a pre-existing interest </span>from doing so. This was consistent with the language of s 51(10) and its statutory context, as well as the observations made by the courts over the years. More holistically, a consideration of the broader contextual developments and legislative history of s 51 of the HDA revealed that Parliament’s consistent policy concern, reiterated on numerous occasions since the inception of the Home Ownership Scheme in 1964, was to prevent the abuse of the privilege of subsidised public housing by those who, under the prevailing regulatory schemes, were <span class="font-italic">ineligible</span> to enjoy the benefits of such subsidised public housing, and yet might nevertheless become entitled to an interest in such property under a trust: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">102]</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 On this view of Parliament’s intention behind s 51(10) of the HDA, it was evident that the Eligibility Interpretation better furthered its legislative purpose. In contrast, by applying to <span class="font-italic">all persons regardless of eligibility</span>, the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation was over-inclusive, depriving even <span class="font-italic">eligible</span> beneficial owners from asserting their interests in HDB property even where they had not purported to “create” the trust through some connivance or intentional nominee arrangement which would be caught by ss 51(8) and 51(9) of the HDA. Further, the practical effect of the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation was that s 51(10) would allow a claim to a resulting or constructive trust over an HDB property <span class="font-italic">only</span> in cases where both parties were already <span class="font-italic">registered owners</span> of the property under a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, and one party sought to argue that their respective beneficial shares of the property should not follow the proportions of their legal shares. There was no basis in the legislative purpose of s 51(10) for circumscribing the operation of resulting or constructive trusts over HDB property this narrowly: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">103]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">106]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 In the proceedings below, there had been no dispute regarding the respondents’ eligibility to own the Property. There was no basis for disturbing the Judge’s factual finding that the respondents were eligible persons. Thus, applying the Eligibility Interpretation, s 51(10) of the HDA did not bar the respondents’ common intention constructive trust claim. The Judge’s decision and order of sale were affirmed on this basis: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[114]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[115]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[117]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 However, the court had considerable reservations about the basis on which the Judge had ordered the appellant to sell the Property and divide the net sale proceeds equally among the siblings <span class="font-italic">under the Pre-Existing Interest Interpretation</span>. There was no legal basis for the Judge to find that the parties’ common intention gave rise to a freestanding equity sufficient to found such an order of sale. This was not a recognised equitable right, obligation or doctrine, and applying the concept of an “equity” in this manner would stretch the existing jurisprudence too far: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[120]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[124]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
