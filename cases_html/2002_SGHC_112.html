</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p xmlns="">1.    Peh Thian Hui, 48 years old, was the boyfriend of LMH, 35 years of

age. They had a sexual relationship from 1991. Peh is married and has three children. LMH

is married but has filed for divorce. She also has three children – two boys and a

girl. The youngest child, the girl, is the victim in this very deplorably depressing case.

She is LMH’s biological daughter and is now 15.<u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">THE CHARGES</p>
<p xmlns="">2.    Peh has pleaded guilty to five charges of aggravated rape against

the victim under section 376 (2) Penal Code ("PC") in that he had sexual

intercourse with her when she was under 14 years of age without her consent. These five

charges involve rape of the victim when she was 9, 10, 11 and 13 years of age. </p>
<p xmlns="">3.    He has also pleaded guilty to one charge of using criminal force

on the victim under section 352 PC, two charges of outrage of modesty under section 354

PC, one charge of abetment of outrage of modesty under section 354 read with section 109

PC and one charge of voluntarily having had carnal intercourse against the order of nature

(fellatio) under section 377 PC. </p>
<p xmlns="">4.    Having pleaded guilty to the said 10 charges, he has admitted and

consented to have the following charges taken into consideration for the purpose of

sentence : 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Two charges of rape under section 376 (1) PC ;</p>
<p align="justify">47 charges of aggravated rape under section 376 (2) PC ;</p>
<p align="justify">One charge of molest under section 354 PC ;</p>
<p align="justify">One charge of abetment of molest under section 354 read with section

  109 PC ;</p>
<p align="justify">One charge of voluntarily having had carnal intercourse against the

  order of nature (fellatio) under section 377 PC.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">5.    LMH has pleaded guilty to a total of seven charges – five of

which were for abetting Peh by intentionally aiding him in committing the aggravated rapes

on her daughter, offences punishable by virtue of section 109 read with section 376 (2)

Penal Code, one charge of outrage of modesty of her daughter under section 354 PC and one

charge of possession of 22 obscene films under section 30 (2)(a) Films Act. </p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Section 376 (2) PC provides that whoever commits rape by having

sexual intercourse with a woman under 14 years of age without her consent shall be

punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than eight years and not more than 20

years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes. Section 109 PC

provides that where no express provision is made by the Code for the punishment of

abetment of an offence, the punishment shall be the same as that provided for the offence.

</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    Section 352 PC provides for imprisonment of up to three months or

a fine of up to $500 or both. Section 354 PC provides for a maximum of two years

imprisonment or fine or caning or any two of such punishments. Section 377 PC allows the

Court to impose imprisonment for life or for up to 10 years and a fine. Section 30 (2)(a)

Films Act provides for a fine of $1,000 for each film (subject to a maximum of $40,000) or

imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.<u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">THE STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    Peh got to know LMH in 1988 through LMH’s husband. Peh and

LMH’s husband were childhood friends. Peh was then a housing agent. He asked LMH to

join him in that line of work. As a result, they operated their business from the flat

with LMH’s bedroom functioning as the office. Peh spent many working hours in the

flat and sometimes worked late and slept there for the night. </p>
<p xmlns="">9.    In 1990, LMH’s husband began to stay away from the flat and

would return only during the weekends and the public holidays. LMH then developed a sexual

relationship with Peh. He would visit the flat regularly except for the weekends and the

public holidays. He also bought household appliances for LMH and supported her and her

children. </p>
<p xmlns="">10.    The sexual abuse of the victim started in 1996. Sometime in

September that year, Peh told LMH he wanted to touch her daughter’s groin. LMH, who

was deeply in love with Peh and did not want to lose him, agreed to let him do so. When

the victim, then 9, returned home after school and had taken her shower and her lunch, LMH

called her into the bedroom. LMH then left the bedroom, shutting the door and leaving the

victim alone with Peh. Peh removed the victim’s shorts, asked her to lie down on the

bed, spread her legs and began to lick her private parts. He then inserted a finger into

her vagina. After some time, he put her shorts back on and allowed her to leave the

bedroom. This forms the subject of one of the section 354 PC charges. </p>
<p xmlns="">11.    Shortly after that first incident, Peh told LMH he wished to have

sexual intercourse with the victim. Again, LMH agreed as she was afraid he would leave her

otherwise. One afternoon, after school, LMH called her daughter into the bedroom and

ordered her to submit to Peh. The victim, who was unwilling to do so, was scolded by her

mother with vulgarities in Hokkien. She gave in eventually to her mother’s demand.

LMH then left her alone in the bedroom with Peh with the door closed. </p>
<p xmlns="">12.    Peh removed the victim’s shorts and stripped himself. He

then inserted his fingers into her vagina and moved them in and out. He then raped her for

about 45 minutes. After that, the victim, who had felt the pain of penetration, rushed to

the toilet to wash herself. She was only nine years old then. </p>
<p xmlns="">13.    All this while, LMH remained outside the bedroom knowing that her

young daughter was being deflowered. </p>
<p xmlns="">14.    That incident was the beginning of many more regular rapes of the

victim by Peh with essentially the same scene being re-enacted – the reluctant victim

being ordered into the bedroom by her mother to submit herself to the sexual desires of

Peh, being scolded into submission by her and being ravished by Peh in her own home with

her mother remaining outside the bedroom, knowing what was going on inside. Peh would

withdraw his penis and ejaculate outside the victim’s body. </p>
<p xmlns="">15.    On 31 December 1999, Peh stayed for the night in LMH’s flat.

At sometime past 11 pm, he was raping the victim as usual in the bedroom while watching

the programme "Countdown 2000" on television. He had a condom on this time. When

it approached midnight, he stopped his thrusting movements but remained inside the victim.

When the host of the programme began the countdown to the new year, he resumed his

thrusting actions, counting along with the host and telling the victim he wanted to have

sex with her on the first day of the year 2000. He finally came to a climax and ejaculated

into the condom. As usual, LMH stayed outside the bedroom, well aware of the rape of her

daughter inside. </p>
<p xmlns="">16.    The rapes were not confined to the flat. In 2000, Peh drove LMH

and the victim, then 13, in his van to Pasir Ris Park. After the van was parked, LMH

opened the door leading to the rear cabin and ordered her daughter to go inside and submit

herself to Peh. After her daughter reluctantly entered the rear cabin to be raped yet

again by Peh, LMH closed the door until it was almost completely shut and stood outside

the van as a lookout. </p>
<p xmlns="">17.    The other section 354 PC charge states that in 1999, Peh inserted

a vibrator into the victim’s vagina and then switched it on while it was inside her.

He removed it subsequently and replaced it with his penis. </p>
<p xmlns="">18.    Sometime in 2000, Peh also ordered the victim to perform fellatio

on him. After she had done so reluctantly for a few minutes, he proceeded to have sexual

intercourse with her. This is the subject of the section 377 PC charge. </p>
<p xmlns="">19.    The abetment of outrage of the victim’s modesty occurred in

the following manner. Sometime in 1998, when the victim was only 12 and Peh was having sex

with her in the same circumstances as before, her mother entered the bedroom. Peh then

told LMH to remove her clothes and join them on the bed. He proceeded to have sexual

intercourse with LMH and asked the victim to watch. The victim turned away. After a while,

Peh withdrew his penis and asked LMH to screen an obscene film on the television set in

the bedroom. When the film was on, Peh proceeded to have sexual intercourse with the

victim again, with her mother lying next to them. He then pulled LMH’s left hand

towards the victim’s private parts and told her to touch the victim there. LMH moved

her hand away but Peh pulled it back. She then complied and touched the victim’s and

Peh’s private parts while Peh continued with the rape of the victim who did not

consent to being touched so intimately by LMH. </p>
<p xmlns="">20.    Sometime between 1999 and 2000, Peh was again having sex with LMH

and her daughter together. He ordered the victim to lick her mother’s private parts.

She did so reluctantly for about five minutes. This is the subject of the section 352 PC

charge. </p>
<p xmlns="">21.    In November 2000, the victim got to know A and his girlfriend, B

when LMH brought her to their shop to purchase a personal computer. </p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The sexual abuse of the victim by Peh aided by LMH continued

through the years until December 2000. </p>
<p xmlns="">23.    In March 2001, LMH told Peh to stop visiting the flat as her

husband had returned. However, they continued in their relationship and stopped seeing

each other only after September 2001 when LMH decided to petition for divorce. They

maintained contact by telephone. </p>
<p xmlns="">24.    In October 2001, the victim learnt that LMH had petitioned for

divorce from her husband and was seeking custody of all three children. She refused to go

with her mother. She then related the sexual abuse she had suffered to A who advised her

to make a police report. The victim was concerned about the repercussions on her mother

should she do so. On 5 November 2001, A brought the victim to a police station where she

lodged a report against Peh, accusing him of rape. She was examined medically and found to

have a sexually transmitted infection. </p>
<p xmlns=""><u>ANTECEDENTS</u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. Both accused persons have no criminal record.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u>PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE</u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. The Prosecution submits that deterrent sentences should be imposed

on both accused persons and that LMH should be punished as severely as Peh by virtue of

her position as the natural mother of the victim and the role she played in the offences.

The age of the victim when she was first raped, the number of occasions of rape and the

indignities suffered by the victim in being forced to engage in a mnage  trois with

her mother are aggravating factors which the Prosecution says should be borne in mind.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. The Prosecution cites for my guidance the cases of Chia Kim Heng

Frederick v PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5841&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 361</a>, PP v Radhakrishna Gnanasegaran [CC 14 of 1999 –

unreported] and PP v Yap Koon Mong <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49457&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 257</a> where the rape charges are concerned.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">PEH’S MITIGATION PLEA</p>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. Peh’s counsel urges me to take into consideration the facts

that the Peh is a first offender and is remorseful and contrite, as shown by the fact that

he indicated he wished to plead guilty even before the preliminary inquiry was held. A

psychiatric report has also been tendered to show that Peh has been deeply affected by his

childhood sexual experience when, as a boy of eight to 10 years of age, he was straddled

by a slightly older girl and instructed to perform cunnilingus on her while she performed

fellatio on him. It appears that the sight of her hairless pubic area never left his mind

leading to his fixation with young girls with no pubic hair. It is also submitted that

there is no possibility of such an offence recurring because the circumstances were most

peculiar to the relationship between Peh and LMH.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">LMH’S MITIGATION PLEA</p>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. LMH’s counsel has also tendered a psychiatric report stating

her very tragic life. Her counsel submits that "As an infant she was unwanted, in

childhood and teenage she was abused, in marriage she was unloved and when she thought she

found love, she was exploited." LMH also has a clean record and has shown her

contrition by pleading guilty. She was molested on three occasions when she was between

eight and 11 years old. She is a weak-willed woman and deeply regrets having failed her

daughter. The pain she suffers is no less than that experienced by her daughter.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. I find it almost abominable to refer to LMH as the victim’s

mother because the facts show that she is the very antithesis of a mother. One cannot help

feeling an overpowering sense of sadness over the fate of so young and hapless a girl like

the victim here. Surely our hearts spring out to her for the long years of appalling abuse

that she had to endure in silent bewilderment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. The rape of the child occurred with revolting regularity in the

very sanctuary called home, sanctioned by the very person whose maternal instincts should

be to protect the victim. The abuse started when the victim had not even seen puberty yet.

It lasted more than four years. It is an incomprehensible atrocity that a mother would

order her little nine year old girl to submit to her then 42 year old lover in this sordid

fashion, all in the name of her love for the abuser. It debases all notions of motherhood

when a mother watches and participates in the rape of her young daughter by her lover. She

was not merely standing by and making music while the city burns – she fed the

flames. It seems to me that any word remotely related to maternal love would be a misnomer

if used to describe such a mother.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. Peh Thian Hui was no simple-minded debutant when he began to direct

his dark desires towards the defenceless nine year old. A one-off crime of passion this

case was not. The rapes once begun became a deadening routine. He even enlisted the

assistance of his lover to rape her child. If indeed he is so obsessed with "the

appearance of a pre-pubertal female genitalia", then surely the submission that he

will not commit such offences again carries little persuasive weight. Peh’s

perversion must never be allowed to touch and affect another young girl’s life. He

must be kept out of society and out of the life and the sight of the victim for a very

substantial period of time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. While we sympathize with those who may have had a difficult

childhood for one reason or the other, we should not be too ready to lay the indefensible

ills of the present on the exhumed experiences of the past, not while their minds are

still rational at any rate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. We hope that today marks the turning point in the life of the

victim and that the fortitude and strength that she has demonstrated will soon help dispel

the darkness of the past and light up a new hope for her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. The sentences I now impose are as follows :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><b>Peh Thian Hui</b></p>
<p align="justify">For each of the five charges under section 376 (2) PC – 12 years
