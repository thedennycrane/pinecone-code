<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Jabing Kho (“the convicted
                    person”) and Galing Anak Kujat (“Galing”) were convicted of
                    murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) read with s 34 of the Penal
                    Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) and punishable under s
                    302 of the same by Kan Ting Chiu J and the then mandatory death sentence was
                    passed on them accordingly. The present proceedings concern the re-sentencing of
                    the convicted person pursuant to s 4(5)(<em>f</em>) of the
                    Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act No. 32 of 2012) (“the PCAA”).
                    After hearing the submissions made by both parties, I re-sentenced the convicted
                    person to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest (26 February
                    2008) and to receive 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The prosecution, which urged me to re-sentence
                    the convicted person to death, has appealed against my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The convicted person was born on 4 January 1984.
                    The charge against him at the trial read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, Jabing Kho, on or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day
                        of February 2008, at about 8.19pm, at the open space near Geylang Drive,
                        Singapore, together with one Galing Anak Kujat, in furtherance of the common
                        intention of both of you, committed murder by causing the death of one Cao
                        Ruyin, male 40 years old, and you have thereby committed an offence
                        punishable under section 302 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter
                        224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The co-accused, Galing, faced a similar charge
                    and both the convicted person and Galing were tried together. On 30 July 2010,
                    Kan J convicted both of them of them of murder committed in furtherance of their
                    common intention and sentenced them to receive the then mandatory death penalty.
                    Kan J accepted that the convicted person’s offence fell within s
                        300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code. His judgment appears
                    at <em>Public Prosecutor v Galing Anak Kujat and
                        another</em> [2010] SGHC 212 (“Kan J’s
                    judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Both Galing and the convicted person appealed
                    against Kan J’s decision. On 24 May 2011, the Court of Appeal affirmed the
                    decision against the convicted person. Galing’s appeal was allowed by the
                    Court of Appeal which substituted his conviction for murder with an offence of
                    robbery with hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 394
                    read with s 34 of the Penal Code (see <em>Kho Jabing and another
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 634 at [38] – “the
                    Court of Appeal’s judgment”). Galing’s case was remitted to
                    Kan J for sentencing in respect of the substituted offence and he was
                    subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years and 6 months and to receive
                    19 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 30 April 2013, the Court of Appeal confirmed
                    that the convicted person was convicted under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code. It allowed his application for his case to
                    be remitted to the High Court for re-sentencing under s 4(5)(<em>f</em>) of the PCAA. The relevant sections of the PCAA are as
                    follow:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    Section 302 of the
                            Penal Code is repealed and the following section substituted
                            therefor:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Punishment for murder</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">302    -(1) Whoever commits murder within the meaning

                                imprisonment for life and shall, if he is not punished with death,
                                also be liable to caning.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Kan J has retired as a Judge of the High Court.
                    The case was therefore placed before me for re-sentencing pursuant to s 4(6) set
                    out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Briefly, the facts of the case are as follow.
                    The convicted person and Galing are from Sarawak, Malaysia. At the time of the
                    offence, they were both working in Singapore on work permits. On 17 February
                    2008, both of them had agreed with three of their fellow countrymen, Vencent,
                    Anthony and Alan, to rob two of Vencent’s co-workers at a worksite in
                    Tiong Bahru. However, as the two co-workers had fortuitously left the worksite,
                    the robbery plan was aborted. The five men remained at Tiong Bahru to consume
                    liquor. Subsequently, they left for Geylang intending to find some victims to
                    rob.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At Geylang, the convicted person and Galing
                    walked some distance away from their fellow countrymen and spotted two possible
                    male prey, Cao Ruyin who is the deceased person named in the charge (“the
                    deceased”) and Wu Jun, walking along a path in an open space near Geylang
                    Drive. Galing assaulted Wu Jun with a belt wrapped around his fist with the
                    metal buckle exposed. The convicted person attacked the deceased with a piece of
                    wood that he had picked up while approaching the deceased. Galing also assaulted
                    the deceased with the metal buckle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The deceased suffered severe head injuries
                    from the attack and passed away in a hospital on 23 February 2008. The cause of
                    death was certified by a pathologist to be severe head injury. Wu Jun escaped
                    with minor injuries and called the police. When they went to the scene of crime,
                    the deceased was lying on the ground unconscious, with his face covered in
                    blood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The deceased’s mobile phone was taken
                    away by Galing. The five Sarawakians regrouped at a coffee shop in Geylang where
                    Galing sold the said mobile phone to Vencent for $300. The five of them took $50
                    each from the sale proceeds and spent the remaining $50 on food and
                    drinks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When the law provides a maximum sentence for
                    an offence, that maximum sentence is reserved for the worst type of cases. This
                    expression should be understood to be marking out a range and an offence may be
                    within it notwithstanding the fact that it could have been worse than it was
                    (see <em>Sim Gek Yong v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1
                    SLR(R) 185 at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Where the law provides for a limited choice of
                    the death penalty or of life imprisonment, neither of the options should be
                    considered the default position. Instead, all the facts and circumstances must
                    be taken into consideration in order to determine if the accused person ought to
                    suffer the death penalty (<em>Sia Ah Kew and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1974 – 1976] SLR(R) 54). In that case, which
                    involved kidnapping for ransom, the Court of Appeal opined that the maximum
                    sentence would be appropriate where the manner of the kidnapping or the acts or
                    conduct of the kidnappers were such as to outrage the feelings of the community.
                    The Court of Appeal also held that it would be wrong to take the view that the
                    alternative sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed only when there were
                    some very exceptional circumstances which did not justify the imposition of the
                    death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The views in <em>Sia Ah Kew and
                        others v Public Prosecutor</em> were endorsed by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Panya Martmontree and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806. This was a case of gang-robbery
                    with murder under s 396 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) which provided
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any one of 5 or more persons who are conjointly committing
                        gang-robbery, commits murder in so committing gang-robbery, every one of
                        those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, and if
                        he is not sentenced to death, shall also be punished with caning with not
                        less than 12 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal held (at [66]) that the appellants’
                    “acts of violence were mercilessly executed and gravely abhorrent in
                    their execution” and “were amply sufficient to outrage the
                    feelings of the community”. The death sentences were therefore
                    upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     During the introduction of the amendments to
                    the law on the mandatory death penalty in homicide cases, the Minister for Law
                    made a statement in Parliament (see Changes to the Application of the Mandatory
                    Death Penalty to Homicide Offences (Statement by Minister for Law), <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (9 July
                    2012) vol 89):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In deciding whether and how to apply the death penalty to a
                        particular offence, several factors have to be considered. In particular I
                        will mention, in broad terms, three interconnected factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(1)    the seriousness of the offence, both in terms
                                of the harm that the commission of the offence is likely to cause to
                                the victim and to society, and the personal culpability of the
                                accused;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    how frequent or widespread an offence
                                is;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(3)    deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These three factors must be considered in their totality. For example, the
                        fact that an offence is not widespread or that its incidence is low may not,
                        by itself, be a decisive factor. The overarching aim of the Government is to
                        ensure the safety and security of Singapore, while maintaining a fair and
                        just criminal system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In respect of other categories of murder, under section 300(b) to (d),
                        there could be different degrees of intention, and these offences are
                        committed in a variety of situations. Today, that is something considered by
                        the Public Prosecutor when he decides the appropriate charge in each case.
                        The factors he considers include the precise intention of the accused, the
                        manner in which the homicide occurred and the deterrent effect a charge may
                        have on others. We want to move towards a framework where the court also has
                        the discretion, to take the same factors into account during
                        sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This change will ensure that our sentencing framework properly balances
                        the various objectives: justice to the victim, justice to society, justice
                        to the accused, and mercy in appropriate cases. … We now have a
                        relatively low incidence of homicides – last year we had 16 recorded
                        homicides, or about 0.3 per 100,000 population. As our society becomes
                        safer, less violent, and more mature, we believe that today’s changes
                        are a right step to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Relying on the three factors spelt out in [15]
                    above, the prosecution submitted that the convicted person had acted in a
                    vicious and pernicious manner. The Court of Appeal described his act of raining
                    heavy blows on the deceased’s head, a vulnerable part of the body, as a
                    “violent assault”. The forensic pathologist had testified that the
                    injuries suffered required “very severe” or “huge”
                    blunt force from multiple blows. Galing had described the deceased’s head
                    as “cracked open”. Wu Jun had testified that the convicted person
                    and Galing attacked him and the deceased stealthily from behind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The prosecution highlighted that the attack
                    occurred in an open public place. The “sheer brazenness of the convicted
                    person and Galing, and their gratuitous use of violence would bring disquiet to
                    society. Also, the fact that the brutal attack was prompted only by greed leaves
                    the public in fear that such ill-fortune may befall on them some
                    day”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The personal culpability of the convicted
                    person was also high. He targeted vulnerable or “easy” victims
                    – those walking alone or with only one other person. He armed himself with
                    a piece of wood that he had picked up. Excessive force was used to immobilize
                    the deceased. Even after the deceased fell to the ground facing up and there was
                    blood coming out from his head, the convicted person did not stop his attack but
                    swung the piece of wood at him a second time. There was no provocation by the
                    deceased whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The only motivation for this cold-blooded and
                    wanton use of violence was greed. There was scant regard for human life. As the
                    Court of Appeal opined at [37] of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, such
                    violent crimes cannot be condoned in any civilised society and severe
                    condemnation is required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defence of intoxication was raised at the
                    trial and on appeal and was rejected by both courts. Indeed, the law is that
                    self-induced intoxication is an aggravating, rather than mitigating, factor. The
                    convicted person was able to recount the events with details and that showed his
                    mind was clear at the time of the offence despite his evidence that he was
                    drunk. His personal circumstances, absence of previous conviction and remorse do
                    not warrant “exceptional leniency”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The prosecution also produced statistics that
                    showed that in the ten years since 2003, there were 25 cases of fatal assault
                    committed in the course of robbery. Out of these 25 cases, 15 involved groups of
                    at least two or more assailants. In 2008, the year in which the present offence
                    took place, there were four cases of fatal assault during robbery by young
                    foreign workers below the age of 30, like the convicted person here. The
                    prosecution argued that “the confidence which society has in the safety
                    and security of Singapore can only be upheld by ensuring that those who
                    contemplate such atrocious actions know that those who show no mercy to their
                    victims will receive no mercy from the law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A deterrent sentence would be appropriate
                    where the offence was committed with premeditation and planning. Examples of
                    particular circumstances of an offence which may attract general deterrence
                    include offences committed by two or more persons and those which, in addition
                    to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of
                    triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public (see
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007] 2
                    SLR(R) 814 at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The deceased was 40 years old at the time of
                    his demise. He was from a rural village in China and had come to Singapore to
                    earn a living as a construction worker. His untimely death would doubtlessly
                    bring indescribable grief to his family in China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For all these reasons, the prosecution urged
                    the court to re-impose the death penalty on the convicted person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The convicted person’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the convicted person relied upon
                    the Ministerial statement set out at [15] above to submit that
                    Parliament’s intention was for the death penalty to be applied
                    restrictively and to a narrower category of homicides and that for cases under s
                        300(<em>b</em>) to (<em>d</em>) of
                    the Penal Code, the death penalty would not be the appropriate starting or
                    default position. Citing <em>Sia Ah Kew and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em>, they argued that the starting or default position in
                    the three categories of homicide cases should be life imprisonment, with the
                    death penalty being the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Counsel for the convicted person also cited
                    cases from India, the United States and South Africa to bolster their arguments
                    at [25] and to conclude that the restrictive approach to the exercise of
                    judicial discretion whereby “the death penalty is only imposed in
                    situations where the offender’s conduct and/or the offence’s facts
                    are exceptionally heinous is consistent with the international
                    trend”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It was proposed that the answers to the
                    following two questions would aid in the exercise of judicial discretion:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_1"></a>(1)     Is there something uncommon about
                        the crime that outrages the feelings of the community and that renders life
                        imprisonment inadequate and calls for a death sentence?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_2"></a>(2)     Are the circumstances such that there
                        is no alternative but to impose the death sentence even after according
                        maximum weight to the mitigating circumstances of the
                    offender?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Each case has to be considered on its own facts to
                    allow for “individualised justice” in sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, the injuries were
                    intended but the fatal outcome was not. The convicted person only intended to
                    incapacitate or temporarily subdue the deceased in order to carry out the
                    robbery. There was no subjective knowledge of the outcome. The use of weapons by
                    both attackers was purely “opportunistic and improvisional” (see
                    the Court of Appeal’s judgment at [35(b)]) and was not premeditated.
                    Further, the piece of wood used was not “a patently deadly weapon such as
                    a knife”. The injuries were inflicted during “a frantic and
                    frenetic fracas”. The deceased was still alive when the convicted person
                    left the scene of the attack and only tragically succumbed to his injuries six
                    days later in the hospital. The conduct of the convicted person and the manner
                    of the deceased’s death were “not exceptionally brutal, heinous,
                    cruel and/or depraved” and the deceased was not vulnerable due to age or
                    infirmity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     There was no clear and undisputed sequence of
                    events and circumstances surrounding the offence (see the Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment at [8] to [10]), including but not limited to the number
                    of times the convicted person hit the deceased. While this was not material for
                    the purpose of a conviction, it was relevant for sentencing. The extent of
                    intoxication, while insufficient to constitute a defence, was not fully and
                    thoroughly explored. There was also no credible objective evidence of the
                    convicted person’s level of intoxication. The death penalty should only be
                    imposed where there was clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an
                    alternative explanation of the facts. It would be appropriate only in the most
                    aggravated circumstances, for instance, where the manner of the fatality and/or
                    the conduct of the offender are particularly aggravated. The present case did
                    not fit into these criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The personal circumstances of the convicted
                    person were also highlighted. At the time of the offence, the convicted person
                    was at the relatively young age of 24. He has been in custody for about five
                    years without incident. He had no criminal antecedents and had cooperated fully
                    during the investigations. He is single and is the only son in his family. His
                    father passed away while the convicted person was awaiting his trial. His mother
                    lives alone and works as a chambermaid in a hotel in Sarawak. She misses the
                    convicted person terribly but does not have the financial means to visit him
                    during his long incarceration. She has mentioned in her clemency plea to the
                    President of Singapore that the death penalty for her son would also be the
                    death sentence for her. While the deceased’s family could be in a similar
                    position, the loss of another life would only add to the tragedy and sorrow from
                    this unfortunate and ill-fated robbery and would not serve the ends of
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 26 August 2009, the Agri-Food and
                    Veterinary Authority of Singapore (“AVA”) issued a media release
                    stating that excessive levels of methanol had been detected in one of the
                    alcoholic products consumed by the convicted person prior to the offence.
                    Methanol poisoning was not contemplated nor assessed during the investigations
                    and the recall of the product was not highlighted during the trial or the
                    appeal. The possibility that the convicted person was suffering from a mental
                    and behavioural disturbance from alcohol could not be discounted and should be
                    considered in sentencing because he would not have known about the excessive
                    amounts of methanol present in the drink that he consumed that
                night.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The convicted person is deeply remorseful
                    about the tragic consequences of his actions. During his incarceration, he
                    “has developed a mark on his forehead as a result of his relentless and
                    continuous Islamic prayers (through the act of bowing his head onto the floor)
                    asking Allah for forgiveness”. If given the opportunity, he intends to
                    locate the deceased’s family to seek forgiveness and to do whatever is
                    possible and within his power to aid the deceased’s family in coping with
                    their lives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Statistics from the Singapore Police
                    Force’s website show that the number of homicide cases registered a
                    20-year low in 2012, dropping from 16 cases in 2011 to 11 cases in 2012. Fatal
                    assaults in the course of robbery have also been on a steady decline in the past
                    ten years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Galing was convicted on a lesser charge.
                    Considering the respective roles and culpability, parity in sentencing would
                    suggest that life imprisonment is appropriate for the convicted person. Further,
                    in another re-sentencing case (Criminal Case No. 40 of 2009), where the facts
                    were largely similar to the present case, Chan Seng Onn J imposed life
                    imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane on 16 July 2013. The convicted person in
                    that case was 18 years old at the time of the offence in question. No written
                    grounds of decision were given and there was no appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As I was not the trial Judge in this case, I
                    relied entirely on Kan J’s judgment and the Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment where the findings of fact were concerned. I do not think I should look
                    further into the evidence adduced at the trial and make further conclusions on
                    the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The issue of intoxication was raised and
                    rejected at both levels and it is not open to the convicted person at this stage
                    to revisit this issue. The AVA’s media release was in 2009 and if it was
                    relevant to the defence of the convicted person, then such evidence should have
                    been adduced during the trial or, in any case, at the appeal after leave has
                    been obtained to adduce fresh evidence. It is certainly improper to attempt to
                    introduce the fresh evidence before me during the re-sentencing
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I agree with the prosecution that there should
                    not be a default position preferring the death penalty or life imprisonment in
                    considering the appropriate sentence under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code. In other legislation providing for punishment
                    for offences, the courts have consistently accepted that there is no presumptive
                    preference that the least severe punishment should be the starting or default
                    position. So if a law allows the court to impose imprisonment with or without
                    caning or a fine or both, the court does not begin its inquiry by asking why the
                    offender should not be fined. Instead, it looks at all the circumstances of the
                    case before deciding to impose one or the other or both of the punishments. The
                    Minister’s statement at [15] above also does not show a presumptive
                    preference for life imprisonment as the starting point. Similarly, it would be
                    wrong to regard the death penalty as the starting point and then see if there
                    are factors which would justify the less severe alternative (see <em>Sia Ah Kew and others v Public Prosecutor)</em>. All the
                    facts of the case should be looked at before deciding which is the appropriate
                    punishment for offences under s 300(b) to (d) of the Penal Code although there
                    are only two stark choices of literally life or death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I do not find it necessary or fruitful to look
                    at decisions in other jurisdictions as to when the death penalty would be
                    appropriate. Each society must decide for itself what type and degree of
                    punishment it wants and needs in the unique context of its values and the level
                    of development on all fronts, including social, cultural and economic
                    ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I do not accept the submission (at [30] above)
                    that the loss of another life (that of the convicted person if the death penalty
                    is imposed) would only add to the tragedy and sorrow and not serve the ends of
                    justice. Such reasoning amplifies the potential grief and sense of loss of an
                    offender’s family while diminishing the already existing grief and loss of
                    a deceased victim’s family. An offender’s life is precious beyond
                    measure to him and his family. A victim’s life is equally precious to him
                    and his family. When a right to life is claimed, it must be remembered that it
                    was the offender who took away the victim’s right to life. While the
                    offender is alive and able to plead his case in court, his victim’s voice
                    can no longer be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     After considering all the factors put forward
                    by the parties, I am of the view that the death penalty is not the appropriate
                    sentence for the convicted person for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     He was relatively young at 24 at the
                        time of the offence in 2008 although he was not as young as the convicted
                        person in Criminal Case No. 40 of 2009 (see [34] above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The convicted person’s choice
                        and use of the piece of wood during the attack were, in the words of the
                        Court of Appeal (see the Court of Appeal’s judgment at [35(b)]),
                        “opportunistic and improvisational” and not part of a
                        pre-arranged plan. Equally so was Galing’s use of his belt as a
                        weapon;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     There
                        was no clear sequence of events concerning the attack. There was no clear
                        evidence that the convicted person went after the deceased from behind
                        without warning and started hitting him on the head with the piece of wood.
                        There was evidence that a struggle could have taken place first between
                        Galing and the deceased before the convicted person stopped chasing Wu Jun
                        and returned to assault the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I therefore re-sentenced the convicted person
                    to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest on 26 February
                    2008. In addition, his acts of violence and the resulting dire consequences
                    warrant that the maximum number of strokes of the cane be imposed. Accordingly,
                    I also ordered him to receive 24 strokes of the cane.</p>
