<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim by U-Hin Manufacturing Pte Ltd
                    (“the first plaintiff”), U-Hin Engineering Pte Ltd (“the
                    second plaintiff”) and Wong Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“the third
                    plaintiff”) (“collectively the plaintiffs”) against BT
                    Engineering Pte Ltd (“the first defendant”) and BGL Engineering
                    Pte Ltd (“the second defendant”) (“collectively the
                    defendants”) for the sum of $1,823,258.49 (“the outstanding
                    sum”) on unpaid invoices for labour and services supplied by the
                    plaintiffs to the first defendant for the construction of a topside module for a
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Although the plaintiffs are three separate
                    Singapore incorporated entities, they share a common office and have one common
                    shareholder, <em>ie</em> Wong Shiu Wong
                    (“Wong”) who is the managing-director of the plaintiff of which
                    Wong’s brother Wong Sui Weng (“Weng”) is the general
                    manager. The plaintiffs are primarily in the business of ship-repair and
                    fabrication of steel works for tankers and other ocean-going
                vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant is in the specialised
                    business of constructing (for the oil and gas industries) topside modules of
                    vessels, processing equipment and structures. Its managing-director at the
                    material time was Gay Beng Toong (“BT”). The first defendant was
                    incorporated on 6 March 1986 as a family company owned by BT, his sister
                    and wife. On 23 November 2006, the first defendant was sold to an American
                    listed company known as Universal Compression Holdings Inc
                    (“Universal”). Subsequently Universal merged with Hanover
                    Compression Company and Exterran Holdings Inc. (“Exterran”), also
                    a listed entity in the United States, and became the owner of the first
                    defendant. BT remained the managing-director of the first defendant
                    notwithstanding the change in ownership while his younger brother Ngay Ming Kok
                    (“Gary”) was at all material times the business development
                    manager of the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The shareholders of the second defendant are
                    Gary’s wife Lucy Tan and one Er Nyong Song. Gary is also the general
                    manager of the second defendant. Although the business of the second defendant
                    was stated (at the time of its incorporation on 25 August 2006) to be
                    marine engineering, it was the defendants’ case that the second
                    defendant’s specific role was to effect advances and loans to the first
                    defendant’s contractors including the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to BT, the first defendant’s
                    business is labour-intensive and starting from about 2000, the first defendant
                    had subcontracted to Wong’s companies various projects. Initially, the
                    first defendant subcontracted to Wong’s firm known as Sunny Construction.
                    After their incorporation, the first defendant subcontracted projects to the
                    plaintiffs. According to BT, it did not matter to the first defendant which of
                    the plaintiffs was its subcontractor since all three companies effectively
                    belonged to Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 2006, the first defendant subcontracted to
                    the plaintiffs its projects numbered 1008, 1026, 1027, 1035, 1036 and 1044 and
                    1045 (collectively “the projects”). Project 1045 (“project
                    1045”) was subsequently awarded to the plaintiffs in 2008. Besides
                    labour, the second plaintiff also provided hand-tools and fabrication materials
                    for project 1045. The plaintiffs’ workers carried out work on the projects
                    and on project 1045 at the premises of the first defendant. It was the
                    plaintiffs’ case that each of its labourers was issued unique
                    identification numbers (“UINs”) by the first defendant that
                    enabled the workers to clock-in and clock-out using their UINs and thumbprints.
                    The accounts department of the first defendant monitored the time spent by the
                    plaintiffs’ workers by issuing a daily manpower list. The plaintiffs
                    (through Weng) submitted invoices (together with timesheets) to the first
                    defendant fortnightly based on the daily manpower lists. Usually, the defendants
                    would pay the plaintiffs within five days of the issuance of the
                    invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It was the plaintiffs’ case that prior to
                    its sale to Universal, the first defendant did not issue purchase orders
                    (“PO”) to the former. However, after Exterran became the owner,
                    the first defendant issued POs to the plaintiffs upon the work being
                    completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the plaintiffs’ version (as
                    given in Weng’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief [“AEIC”]),
                    Weng was told by BT in 2007 that the first defendant was losing money (of about
                    $8m) on project 1008 but BT could not divulge this to Universal as otherwise BT
                    would not achieve a higher price for the first defendant. To conceal such
                    losses, Weng alleged that BT called him to a meeting and requested Weng to issue
                    credit notes so that the expenses incurred by the first defendant on project
                    1008 could be reduced thereby erasing the losses. BT promised to pay the
                    plaintiffs all the sums stated in the credit notes by utilising funds from
                    future projects that were profitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Based on BT’s assurances, Weng deposed
                    that the second plaintiff issued the following credit notes which were backdated
                    at BT’s request:-</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The defendants agreed that the first credit note was actually issued
                    on 12 December 2007 but asserted that the second credit note was not
                    backdated. Gary was alleged by the plaintiffs to have stopped making payment on
                    the plaintiffs’ invoices. This resulted in the plaintiffs being unable to
                    pay their workers. When BT requested him to provide additional subcontract works
                    for project 1045, Weng said the plaintiffs could not. As a result, Gary made
                    cash advances of $312,000 to Wong so that the plaintiffs could carry on working
                    on project 1045. Weng deposed that Gary wrongly asked for the return of the
                    advances even though that meant that the plaintiffs had paid the salaries of
                    their workers without receiving any payment from the first
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Weng alleged that as the first defendant could
                    not pay the plaintiffs due to its impending sale to Universal, Gary used the
                    second defendant to make advances to the plaintiffs. Weng further alleged that
                    BT instructed the plaintiffs and other subcontractors of the first defendant to
                    stop issuing invoices to the first defendant and to issue them instead to the
                    second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     BT on the other hand deposed that from the
                    very beginning of their relationship, Wong constantly requested the first
                    defendant for advances/loans for subcontracted jobs. Initially, BT acceded to
                    the request to help Wong with his cash-flow. However over time, BT discovered
                    that the practice of asking for advances became the <em>modus
                        operandi</em> of the plaintiffs/Wong’s operations. Other
                    subcontractors of the first defendant also requested cash advances but to a
                    lesser extent than the plaintiffs/Wong. BT was concerned about the practice and
                    after consulting Gary, the brothers decided that a mechanism had to be
                    instituted to verify that the quantum of advances/loans requested was justified
                    as the first defendant’s practice of making advances had thus far been too
                    liberal. That decision led to the incorporation of the second defendant in
                    August 2006. At that time, it was uncertain whether the impending sale to
                    Universal of the first defendant would materialise. The sale was eventually
                    concluded on 26 November 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After the incorporation of the second
                    defendant, Gary was tasked with handling the invoices issued by contractors to
                    the first defendant. He would scrutinise the invoices for over-claims and assess
                    whether a contractor’s request for advances should be granted and to what
                    extent. The second defendant followed up by disbursing payments to contractors
                    which sums the first defendant would later reimburse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Against the above backdrop, BT deposed in his
                    AEIC that the defendants made the following payments to the plaintiffs:-</p>

<p class="Judg-1">of which the plaintiffs had repaid the first advance
                    ($152,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As it was against the policy of Universal to
                    make cash advances, BT deposed that Gary instructed the plaintiffs not to issue
                    invoices to the first defendant but to issue them to the second defendant so
                    that the latter could reconcile the advances it had made against the
                    plaintiffs’ invoices in its books of accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     BT admitted that the plaintiffs did issue the
                    two credit notes set out in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above but,
                    contrary to Weng’s testimony, they were issued due to the
                    plaintiffs’ breaches of the subcontracts for the projects. For convenience
                    however, both credit notes only referred to project 1008 as BT thought payment
                    for the other projects had more or less been completed. He denied Weng’s
                    allegation that the defendants had promised but failed to pay the second
                    plaintiff on other projects in exchange for the credit notes. BT pointed out
                    that the defendants did give full credit for the first credit note of
                    $550,228.73 but only $35,741.76 for the second credit note, leaving a balance of
                    $163,029.51 in the defendants’ favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     BT deposed it was patently untrue for the
                    plaintiffs to allege that he had asked Weng to deliberately reduce the
                    liabilities of the first defendant so that the company could be sold to
                    Universal at a higher price. He pointed out that it made no sense for him to
                    transfer the first defendant’s liabilities to the second defendant as the
                    sale to Universal was generally based on 75% of the first defendant’s
                    earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization
                    (‘‘EBIDTA’’) for the fiscal years ending 31 March
                    2007, 2008 and 2009 and, he had wholly funded the second defendant. Transferring
                    the liabilities to the second defendant only meant he would have to bear the
                    liabilities personally whereas leaving them with the first defendant made no
                    significant impact on the consideration he would receive from Universal because
                    of the manner in which the sale price to Universal was calculated. The
                    plaintiffs’ allegation could not be true in any event because project 1008
                    was never unprofitable – in fact it made a profit of $7,442,928.51 for the
                    first defendant (for which BT produced statements of accounts to the
                    court).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     BT revealed that from 2006 onwards, the
                    plaintiffs committed repeated breaches of the works under the projects and
                    project 1045. These included placing unsuitable/unskilled or insufficiently
                    skilled workers on jobs and providing poor or non-existent supervision of
                    workers. BT ascertained from his staff that the reason for the plaintiffs’
                    deteriorated standards in workmanship was due to the fact that they were
                    recruiting unskilled labourers and then training them to do jobs meant for
                    skilled workers, in order to cut costs. The plaintiffs also overcharged the
                    second defendant by invoicing for 50 workers when in reality only 25 workers
                    were supplied to the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The substandard labour provided by the
                    plaintiffs had an adverse impact on the first defendant in particular on project
                    1008. That project was a $30 million contract awarded by Petreco
                    International Inc for the construction of three process modules which were
                    ultimately to be shipped to Brazil. Due to the plaintiffs’ poor
                    workmanship which also delayed the project, additional work amounting to US$2.8
                    million had to be done in Brazil. As a result, the first defendant’s
                    expected revenue of US$27,480,426.00 from project 1008 was reduced to
                    US$24,680,426.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In addition, the defendants came to know that
                    the second plaintiff had failed to pay Goods and Services Tax
                    (“GST”) when the first defendant was appointed the second
                    plaintiff’s agent under the GST Act by a letter from the Inland Revenue
                    Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) dated 17 March 2008, for
                    outstanding GST amounting to $416,687.63. After receipt of the aforesaid letter
                    from IRAS, the first defendant remitted a sum of $85,275.69 to IRAS on or about
                    29 May 2008 and was released as the second plaintiff’s agent.
                    Subsequently, the first defendant received (between 17 December 2008 and 5
                    February 2010) five more similar letters from the IRAS. However, no payment was
                    made by the first defendant to IRAS as the second plaintiff’s appointed
                    agent as, by 15 July 2008, the parties (according to the defendants but
                    denied by the plaintiffs) had entered into a compromise agreement with the
                    result that no monies were subsequently due to the second plaintiff from the
                    first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Compromise Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As a result of the poor quality of work
                    provided by the plaintiffs (which worsened over time), the first defendant was
                    reluctant to issue any further POs to the plaintiffs. BT and Gary thought it
                    would be prudent to try to resolve the claims the parties had against one
                    another, bearing in mind that the defendants had by then advanced $489,000 to
                    the plaintiffs (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>). The opportunity
                    to do so presented itself when Weng called at the defendants’ premises on
                    15 July 2008 (“the meeting”) to inquire about payment on
                    outstanding invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the meeting (at which Gary was present), BT
                    told Weng the defendants were willing to settle any and all outstanding invoices
                    and work done by the plaintiffs by the payment of a global sum to the
                    plaintiffs, in view of the fact that the projects were drawing to a close. BT
                    invited Weng to propose a figure. After doing some mental calculations, Weng
                    asked for $450,000 which BT and Gary understood did not include
                GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The two brothers felt comfortable with the
                    figure and indicated to Weng that $450,000 was acceptable. (Henceforth the
                    $450,000 will be referred to as “the settlement sum”). However,
                    they were not certain whether a variation claim of $122,017.17 under project
                    1035 and another variation claim of $80,000 under project 1045 had been settled
                    by the defendants. It was therefore agreed between the parties that the
                    settlement sum would be adjusted downwards if it was later confirmed that those
                    variation claims had been paid. The parties further agreed that the
                    defendants’ advances of $489,000 would be repaid by the
                plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the presence of Weng and Gary, BT wrote out
                    the following handwritten agreement there and then (henceforth referred to as
                    “the Compromise Agreement”):-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Final settlement with “U-Hin” and “Wong
                        Eng’g” on all outstanding invoices/payment/claims including but
                        not limited to BTG/1035, 1043, 1044, 1045 etc @ $450,000 pending the
                        confirmation of BTG/1035 VO claims of $122,017.17 and BTG/1045 VO claims of
                        $80,000. The variance of the confirmation amount pending shall be adjusted
                        in the provisional amount of $450,000/-.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">BT revealed that he had made a mistake in the credit note amount of
                    $582,771 stated in the Compromise Agreement; it should have been $550,228.73 but
                    he could not recall how his mistake came about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     BT deposed that at the meeting, the parties
                    agreed on a proper paper trail to evidence the sums paid by the defendants to
                    the plaintiffs for work done. In particular, the parties agreed that the
                    defendants would issue POs totalling $939,000 <em>viz</em>
                    the settlement sum plus $489,000 for loans and/or advances and payments to the
                    plaintiffs who would in return issue invoices for the same amounts to the
                    defendants which the defendants would pay. Simultaneously, the plaintiffs would
                    repay the loans and/or advances that had been made to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     After the Compromise Agreement had been
                    signed, Gary and BT checked with the defendants’ projects and accounts
                    departments on the actual sums owed to the plaintiffs under projects 1035 and
                    1045. They were informed that the first defendant had paid $122,017.17
                    (excluding GST) for project 1035 but did not make payment on project 1045.
                    However in the course of these proceedings, BT discovered that the first
                    defendant had not in fact paid $122,017.17 on project 1035. What the first
                    defendant did was to set-off the sums owed on project 1035 with the
                    plaintiffs’ credit note dated 26 May 2008 for $117,427.93 (<em>viz</em> $109,745.73 less GST). The defendants realised their
                    mistake only in February 2010. However, the plaintiffs were in no way prejudiced
                    by the defendants’ error – BT pointed out that the POs issued
                    pursuant to the Compromise Agreement totalled $824,965.26 (<em>viz</em>, $939,000 less $114,034.74 which the defendants mistakenly
                    thought they had paid to the plaintiffs) whereas the plaintiffs were actually
                    owed $4,289.01 more. Consequently, the defendants owed the sum of $393,866.07
                    under the Compromise Agreement, not $389,600.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     After the Compromise Agreement was signed,
                    payment of $197,995.20 by the defendants was immediately made to the second
                    plaintiff on the day itself <em>viz</em> 15 July 2008.
                    On the same day, in performance of the Compromise Agreement, the plaintiffs
                    repaid $152,000 on the first advance made to them on 3 April 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). This was followed by the
                    first defendant’s issuance of a PO on 23 July 2008 to the second
                    plaintiff for the sum of $237,393 coupled with payment. On 3 October 2008,
                    the first defendant issued another PO to the first plaintiff for $389,600.
                    However, no payment was made by the defendants on this PO because the plaintiffs
                    did not continue to repay the advances that had been extended by the defendants
                    (although BT noted that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim had given
                    credit for $312,000; this figure corresponded to the third advance made by the
                    defendants on 22 May 2008). Consequently, the plaintiffs still owed the
                    defendants $163,029.51 for advances/loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     BT deposed he was surprised when the
                    plaintiffs commenced this action against the defendants as the plaintiffs’
                    original claim for $416,872 comprised of $389,600 (being the amount in the last
                    PO issued by the defendants) inclusive of GST. The defendants no longer owed any
                    sums to the plaintiffs as a result of the Compromise Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     BT found it even more galling and shocking
                    that after the plaintiffs’ unsuccessful summary judgment application, they
                    amended their claim against the defendants to $2,185,131.79 to include unpaid
                    invoices issued by the plaintiffs. Even if such invoices were outstanding (which
                    they were not), the same had been cancelled by the plaintiffs or they would have
                    been subsumed in the Compromise Agreement. He accused the plaintiffs of
                    fabricating such claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In his AEIC, Gary went into considerable
                    detail to explain why the plaintiffs’ claim for $2,185,131.79 on unpaid
                    invoices had no merit. Gary echoed BT’s contention that the
                    plaintiffs’ invoices had been subsumed in the Compromise Agreement or
                    cancelled or already paid. Gary deposed that the claim of $2,185,131.79 against
                    the first defendant comprised of (i) $867,237.12 plus GST of $60,706.60; (ii)
                    $1,185,990.07; and (iii) $71,198.00. The only claim against the second defendant
                    was for $261,870.21.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As the former business manager of the first
                    defendant and the general manager of the second defendant, Gary deposed he
                    worked very closely with the projects and accounts departments of both companies
                    and was very familiar with the invoices which were the subject of the
                    plaintiffs’ claim. Based on the records of the defendants’ accounts
                    department, Gary maintained that the plaintiffs’ invoices had either been
                    paid or were cancelled or were subsumed in the Compromise Agreement or were
                    fabricated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In support of his assertion that the plaintiff
                    had been paid $416,887.12 by the first defendant (according to the records of
                    its accounts department and corroborated by payment vouchers signed by Wong),
                    Gary exhibited cheque images to some of the invoices which were stamped PAID by
                    his accounts department. Gary relied on BT’s AEIC to say that one invoice
                    for $20,000 (invoice 045/2007 dated 17 December 2007) had been cancelled by oral
                    agreement between BT and Wong in early 2008 because it should have been billed
                    to another job.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Gary identified the following invoices as
                    having been wrongly issued by the plaintiffs:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Gary contended that the above jobs were not completed at the
                    defendants’ yard and were the subject of the Compromise
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Gary deposed that the plaintiff’s
                    invoice no. 0033/2008 dated 22 February 2008 for $47,037.20 was false as
                    the defendants had paid the amount on 29 May 2008 as evidenced in the first
                    defendant’s payment advice. The same accusation was made as regards
                    invoice 0094/2008 ($663,400) on which the plaintiffs claimed a balance of
                    $351,400 purportedly for supplying manpower to job BT/1045. The first
                    defendant’s accounts department informed Gary that no PO for $663,400 was
                    issued. Accordingly no invoice should have been issued by the plaintiffs for the
                    amount. The only POs for job project 1045were PO35014 for $830,320 and PO37556
                    for $254,010.51 issued on 30 January 2008 and 18 July 2008
                    respectively. As for PO35014, the plaintiffs only did work up to the value of
                    $823,857.20 for which the defendants paid. For PO37556, the defendants were paid
                    in full on 23 July 2008. Like BT, Gary noted that the defendants had been
                    given credit for $312,000 on 2 September 2008 which sum coincided with the
                    advance made to the plaintiffs by the defendants on 22 May 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Gary accused the plaintiffs
                    of fabricating the invoice for $663,400. He deposed that the defendants had paid
                    the plaintiffs $1,045,122.86 which figure, after factoring in the
                    plaintiffs’ first credit note in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    was increased to $1,595,351.59. His figures were not disputed by Weng during
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Gary corroborated BT’s account on the
                    genesis of the second defendant and the purpose of its incorporation. He
                    reiterated BT’s testimony that the other invoices claimed by the
                    plaintiffs were subsumed in the Compromise Agreement. It would not be necessary
                    therefore to refer to Gary’s evidence in that respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It would also not be necessary to set out the
                    parties’ pleadings either as the same was alluded to earlier. It is to be
                    noted however that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim was amended twice.
                    Initially, the first plaintiff made a claim for $416,872 for its final invoice
                    no. 0061/2008 based on the defendants’ PO No. 38967 dated 3 October
                    2008 ($389,600 plus 7% GST amounting to $27,272). Subsequently, the second and
                    third plaintiffs were made parties to the action. The statement of claim was
                    amended <em>in extenso</em> and the claims were increased
                    to $867,237.12 (not including 7% GST) as being owed to the first plaintiff by
                    the first defendant, $1,185,990.07 as being owed by the first defendant to the
                    second plaintiff, $71,198 as being owed by the first defendant to the third
                    plaintiff and $261,870.21 as being owed to the second plaintiff by the second
                    defendant. The claims totalled $2,447,002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At the commencement of trial, the plaintiffs
                    amended and reduced their claim to the outstanding sum ($1,823,258.49). It was
                    also established from Weng’s testimony (at Notes of Evidence
                    (“N/E”) 53-54) that the first plaintiff was not registered for GST
                    with the relevant authorities at the material time. Consequently, the first
                    plaintiff was not entitled to claim any GST from the defendants, whether based
                    on 7% or on any other rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I should add that the defendants have a
                    counterclaim against the plaintiffs. The counterclaim in its final form was for
                    the unpaid balance of $163,029.51 due under the second credit note issued by the
                    plaintiffs in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above and for the three
                    sums of $10,000, $50,000 and $20,000 initially advanced by Gary which debts were
                    subsequently paid and taken over by the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   The plaintiffs’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Weng and Wong were the plaintiffs’ two
                    key witnesses. As I have set out the plaintiffs’ version of events in
                    earlier paragraphs, I move straight to a review of the evidence adduced from the
                    brothers in their cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Weng (PW1) made significant concessions on the
                    defendants’ case when he was questioned by counsel for the defendants.
                    First, he agreed that the meeting with BT and Gary was to settle all invoices of
                    the plaintiffs on a lump sum basis. He then agreed that the discussions
                    culminated in the Compromise Agreement (see N/E 31/32).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In his AEIC (para 33), Weng claimed that
                    he agreed to accept $450,000 in full and final settlement of the
                    plaintiffs’ outstanding invoices on the basis that the defendants’
                    cash advances in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> would be written off. He
                    alleged that after he had signed the Compromise Agreement, he reminded BT that
                    the defendants were to repay the plaintiffs’ credit notes from payments
                    for future projects. However, BT had responded that he did not want to pay the
                    plaintiffs anymore. Counsel for the defendants pointed out to Weng that in view
                    of BT’s response, it was illogical of Weng to then contend (in his AEIC)
                    that the Compromise Agreement (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) was
                    subject to the defendants’ return of the credit note amounts. It is
                    noteworthy that the Compromise Agreement only referred to the plaintiffs’
                    obligation to <em>return</em> advances made by the
                    defendants, there was no mention that the defendants had to <em>refund</em> the credit note sums of $550,228.73 to the plaintiffs
                    (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     When the above fact was pointed out by counsel
                    for the defendants during his cross-examination (at N/E 42),Weng took refuge in
                    the excuse that in actual fact, he did not know what was written in the
                    Compromise Agreement. Questioned by the court (at N/E 43) whether he had signed
                    the document blindly, Weng prevaricated and said he had signed the Compromise
                    Agreement based on issues that were agreed between himself and BT. Weng admitted
                    that he was given an opportunity to read the Compromise Agreement but he could
                    not understand it. I disbelieve Weng’s unconvincing explanation. It was
                    not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that Weng did not understand the
                    Compromise Agreement on the basis of <em>non est
                        factum</em>. Neither was it the plaintiffs’ pleaded case (as
                    stated in para 29 of the plaintiffs’ closing submissions) that Weng
                    was under pressure from various sources (not identified) and felt he had no
                    choice but to sign the Compromise Agreement. Further, no evidence was led on
                    this spurious allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Weng’s AEIC (para 15) as well as
                    the reply and defence to counterclaim had alleged that the credit note for
                    $550,228.73 was issued at BT’s behest to conceal losses incurred on
                    project 1008 from the first defendant’s buyer. Quite apart from BT’s
                    denial, this was a wild and absurd allegation in the light of BT’s
                    explanation (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) as to how the sale
                    price to Universal was calculated and the fact that project 1008 was actually
                    profitable, based on documents produced by BT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It was more likely than not (as the defendants
                    contended), that the plaintiffs agreed to and issued two credit notes because
                    they were in breach of contract in providing substandard and/or defective works
                    to the defendants, as evidenced in the defendants’ documents (at
                    DB37-149). While I am mindful that these documents did not form part of the
                    agreed documents before the court, I note that counsel for the plaintiffs did
                    not raise strenuous objections when they were referred to by BT nor did he
                    challenge their authenticity. In their closing submissions (at para 37),
                    the plaintiffs merely said that the defendants provided a sampling of random
                    examples of alleged minor breaching of the subcontracts, nothing
                more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I note further that Weng eventually agreed
                    with counsel (at N/E 49) that the defendants’ position on the Compromise
                    Agreement was correct. Weng further agreed that some of the plaintiffs’
                    claims (including that for GST) were unfounded and or fabricated amongst them
                    being the unpaid invoice for $663,400 – which Wong eventually admitted (at
                    N/E 107) was never sent to the defendants. No mention was made by Weng in his
                    AEIC of the claim for $20,000 which the defendants disputed. In
                    cross-examination of Weng, Wong’s complaint in his AEIC that the second
                    defendant was attempting to recover personal loans ($10,000, $20,000 and
                    $50,000) made by Gary to Wong was proven to be incorrect. While the moneys came
                    from Gary initially, Gary had subsequently been reimbursed by the second
                    defendant so that the debt was owed to the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Nothing turns on Wong’s testimony as it
                    was Weng who negotiated with BT and signed the Compromise Agreement on the
                    plaintiffs’ behalf. Wong confirmed that what he knew of the discussions
                    and negotiations between his brother and BT was what he was told by Weng. Hence,
                    Wong’s AEIC was replete with hearsay evidence. Like Weng, Wong’s
                    AEIC (albeit to a lesser extent) contained speculation and scurrilous
                    accusations against BT and Gary, regarding BT’s motive in incorporating
                    the second defendant. Offensive paragraphs in his and Weng’s AEIC were
                    eventually withdrawn when they took the stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   The defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     BT (DW2) and Gary (DW1) were the
                    defendants’ witnesses. Unlike Wong and Weng, their testimony did not
                    contradict but was corroborated by documents that were before the court. They
                    were far more credible witnesses than the Wongs. Indeed, their cross-examination
                    reinforced my finding. In this regard I reject the plaintiffs’ submission
                    that BT was an evasive and unreliable witness. That criticism can be levelled at
                    Weng and to a lesser extent Wong, but not against BT or Gary; both were
                    forthright and truthful. Weng on the other hand was found to be lying on so many
                    occasions that he lost all credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiffs’ closing submissions were
                    premised on the plaintiffs’ version of events being true and correct.
                    Sometimes those submissions completely disregarded or contradicted the evidence
                    that was adduced in court from the plaintiffs’ own witnesses. I note too
                    that the plaintiffs’ submissions (para 30) asserted that the
                    Compromise Agreement was signed by BT on behalf of the first defendant only and
                    not on behalf of the second defendant. That however was not the
                    plaintiffs’ pleaded position nor asserted by Weng in his AEIC nor put to
                    BT when he was in the witness stand. Consequently, I reject the
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiffs’ pleaded case on the
                    Compromise Agreement was that it did not come into effect because of the
                    non-fulfilment of the preconditions <em>viz</em>
                    confirmation of the two variation claims of $122,017.17 and $80,000. However, as
                    the defendants argued and which I accept, there were no preconditions, only the
                    requirement of confirmation of whether the two variation clams had been paid by
                    the defendants as BT thought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiffs’ stand was sometimes
                    ambivalent. Although they disclaimed knowledge (in para 62 of their
                    submissions) on how the figure of $582,771 in the Compromise Agreement was
                    arrived at and even accused BT of creating the same, it is noteworthy that in
                    another part of their submissions (at para 41), the plaintiffs complained
                    that the defendants reneged on their promise to return the credit note sum of
                    $749,006 or even $582,771. The plaintiffs had obviously overlooked BT’s
                    explanation that the amount of $582,771 was incorrect and should have been the
                    first credit note amount of $550,228.73 in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> which was never in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Although Wong/Weng contended that they were
                    not obliged to return the defendants’ advances, the fact remains that the
                    plaintiffs repaid the defendants the first advance of $152,000 in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> on or about 15 July 2008, in part
                    performance of the Compromise Agreement. Moreover, in the first amendment to the
                    statement of claim (at para 10), the plaintiffs themselves gave credit for
                    the defendants’ third advance of $312,000 on 2 September 2008. Such
                    conduct seriously undermined the plaintiffs’ case and the credibility of
                    their witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiffs’ submissions dealt at
                    length with the issue of extrinsic evidence not being admissible to interpret
                    the Compromise Agreement as well as the application of the <em>contra proferentum</em> rule. With respect, those issues do not arise
                    here. It is my view that the Compromise Agreement is clear on its terms and
                    there is no need to import extraneous facts for its
                interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The documents presented in court were
                    consistent with the defendants’ position, as given by BT and Gary that
                    after end January 2008, any work carried out by the plaintiffs must be
                    accompanied by a PO. Their testimony that invoices of the plaintiffs subsequent
                    to that timeframe, if unaccompanied by the defendants’ POs were either
                    false or fabricated, was substantiated by no less a person than Weng, who had
                    admitted (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above) that the
                    plaintiffs’ invoice for $663,400 was never sent to the defendants; it can
                    only be said to have been fabricated as BT and Gary contended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Taken in its totality, the evidence adduced in
                    court showed on a balance of probabilities that the plaintiffs’ claim had
                    no merit. More significantly, the evidence corroborated the defendants’
                    pleaded case that the claims and counterclaims between the parties involved had
                    been subsumed in the Compromise Agreement. I turn my attention therefore to that
                    document.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Compromise Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I had set out the full text of the Compromise
                    Agreement earlier at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>. Contrary to the
                    submission of the plaintiffs, I find no ambiguity in the text such as to require
                    the application of the <em>contra proferentum</em>
                    rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     To elaborate, the parties to the agreement
                    were set out: “U-Hin” can only refer to the first and second
                    plaintiffs while “Wong Eng’g” must refer to the third
                    plaintiff. The words ‘‘final settlement” are clearly stated
                    while “all outstanding invoices/payment/claims including but not limited
                    to...” reinforced the understanding that the agreement was to be a global
                    settlement of all accounts between the parties. As for the note “the
                    above is subjected [sic] to the return of all advance payments and CN amounting
                    to $582,771 prior to the issue of the final settlement payment”, the
                    words could only have referred to the advances made to and the credit notes
                    issued by, the plaintiffs since neither the first nor the second defendants were
                    the recipients of advances or issuer of credit notes. Consequently, the
                    plaintiffs’ argument that the Compromise Agreement precluded the
                    defendants from recovering the advances and the credit note sums is
                    rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Do the words “...pending the
                    confirmation of BTG/1035 VO claims of $80,000” render the Compromise
                    Agreement conditional? I do not think so. I accept the evidence of BT that the
                    lump sum settlement of $450,000 was subject to adjustment downwards but not
                        upwards<em>, viz</em> the amount could be less but not
                    more than $450,000 as that figure was the maximum sum the defendants were
                    willing to pay to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I turn next to the law on compromise
                    agreements. I can do no better in this regard than to refer to the recent Court
                    of Appeal decision in <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence
                        Peter</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<em>Gay’s</em> case”) cited by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Gay’s</em>
                    case, the Court of Appeal cited Foskett QC’s authoritative textbook (at
                    [41]) on what constituted a valid compromise agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the leading Commonwealth textbook on compromise and settlements,
                        Foskett QC sets out the following definition of a “compromise”
                        (see David Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice of
                            Compromise</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005) at
                        para 1-01) (“Foskett”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Compromise can be defined as the <em>settlement of dispute
                            by mutual concession, its essential foundation being the ordinary law of
                            contract</em>… A more practical and, perhaps, more apt
                        description would be <em>the complete or partial resolution
                            by agreement of differences before final adjudication by a court or
                            tribunal of competent jurisdiction</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Court of Appeal went on to spell out (at
                    [46]) the essential requirements of a compromise:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Foskett has observed (at para 3-01), and adopted in <em>Info-communications</em> (at [115]), a compromise will
                        not arise unless certain requirements are fulfilled; these include
                        (differing somewhat, though, from the precise sequence Foskett has adopted)
                        what is, in fact, traditionally required under the general common law of
                        contract, <em>viz</em>, an identifiable agreement that
                        is complete and certain, consideration, as well as an intention to create
                        legal relations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Compromise Agreement satisfies all three
                    tests. The agreement is certainly identifiable, consideration was provided by
                    both parties to the agreement and undoubtedly there was an intention to create
                    legal relations. It was also common ground that both parties intended to resolve
                    all their differences by the Compromise Agreement. It would not be necessary
                    therefore to dwell further on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The other defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Even if I am wrong in my finding and the
                    Compromise Agreement does not constitute a valid compromise agreement, I am of
                    the view that the defendants have successfully proven on a balance of
                    probabilities, that the plaintiffs’ invoices upon which their numerous
                    claims were based were either (i) paid or (ii) cancelled or (iii) fabricated.
                    Indeed, the plaintiffs’ claims bordered on dishonesty. I have in mind
                    Weng’s evidence in this regard; he was a totally unreliable witness as can
                    be seen from the comments on his testimony in <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> to <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Consequently, I have no hesitation in
                    dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims with costs. I award both defendants
                    judgment and costs on their counterclaim for $163,029.51 and judgment for
                    $80,000 in favour of the second defendant only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Addendum to Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">30 August 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     After judgment was delivered, the court was informed by the defendants’ solicitors that they had made an Offer to Settle (“the OTS”) pursuant to O 22A r 9(3)(b) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) to the plaintiffs on 18 February 2010. The OTS <em>inter alia</em> stated the defendants were willing to pay the sum of $100,000 to the plaintiffs in full and final settlement of all claims with each party bearing its own costs. The defendants gave a deadline of 5 March 2010 to the plaintiffs to accept the OTS failing the same would be deemed to be withdrawn. There was no response from the plaintiffs’ solicitors on the OTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Under O 22 r 9(3)(b) of the Rules, the terms of the OTS were more favourable to the plaintiffs than the judgment herein, as I had dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims. Consequently, the defendants are entitled to their costs on a standard basis up to and including 18 February 2010 and thereafter they are entitled to costs against the plaintiffs on an indemnity basis.</p>
