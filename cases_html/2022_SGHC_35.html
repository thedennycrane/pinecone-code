The benefits usually come in the form of consent fees which are often fixed by reference to a percentage of the face value of the debt held by the creditor. These benefits act as an incentive for scheme creditors to commit to the proposal at an early stage, thereby ensuring that the scheme will not fail subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 It has not been considered in a published decision in Singapore whether creditors who enter into such lock-up agreements should be placed in a separate class from the other creditors for the purpose of voting on a scheme of arrangement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether these lock-up agreements would “fracture” a class of creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 BPS is a Singapore-incorporated private company that is limited by shares.

BOHL also applied for and obtained moratorium protection under s 211C of the CA. These moratoria had been extended multiple times by court orders until 31 January 2022.

The issue which arises is whether these Locked-in Creditors should have been placed in a separate class when voting instead of being allowed to vote in a single class with the other voting Scheme Creditors.

Firstly, the BOHL Lock-up Agreements were offered to all Scheme Creditors in July 2021 prior to the despatch of the BPS Scheme. Secondly, the BOHL Consent Fee of 1.0% of the Scheme Creditor’s admitted debt was not so substantial that it would induce the Locked-in Creditors to vote in favour of the scheme (which they might otherwise reject). In particular, there was sufficient commercial justification for Scheme Creditors to vote in favour of the BPS Scheme.

Floyd J held that no separate classification was required having regard to the following factors in <span class="font-italic">Re DX Holdings</span> at [7]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) all the scheme creditors were offered an opportunity to enter into the lock-up agreement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was unlikely that a creditor who considered the scheme to be against its interests would be persuaded to vote in favour of the scheme by the existence of the consent fee; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the amount of consent fee payable (ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%) is small in relation to the common interests of the creditors in the restructuring.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Subsequent decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Re Noble Group Ltd (No 1)</span> [2019] 2 BCLC 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Noble</span>”) further elaborate upon the requirements set out in the earlier cases, and in particular, how the court should assess whether the consent fee payable to creditors under a lock-up agreement is so material that the rights of the creditors who will not be paid the fees are sufficiently dissimilar such that they cannot consult together with a view to their common interest. In <span class="font-italic">Re Noble </span>(at [150]), Snowden J observed that in evaluating the materiality of consent fees, it is inappropriate to simply look at the percentage which the fee bears to the face value of the debt held. Rather, what is more relevant is the size of the fee when compared to the predicted returns offered to all creditors under the scheme and the returns that creditors are predicted to make in a liquidation scenario (or the appropriate comparator): <span class="font-italic">Re Noble</span> at [151]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Re Codere Finance 2 (UK) Ltd (No 1)</span> [2021] 2 BCLC 396 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span>”) (at [105]), in evaluating whether the size of the consent fee was material, Falk J did not merely consider the absolute value of the consent fee in the abstract, but made a comparison to the likely forecasted returns under the scheme and a liquidation scenario (which was the appropriate comparator). It was held that a consent fee between 0.5%–1.0% (<span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span> at [26]) is unlikely to exert a material influence on the creditors’ voting decision: <span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span> at [105]. This observation was made in the context where the company was expected to make full recovery if the scheme was implemented (<span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span> at [15]–[16]), as opposed to a likely liquidation scenario where the returns ranged between 0%–4.1% (<span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span> at [20]–[21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the decision of <span class="font-italic">Re ColourOz</span>, Snowden J conducted a comprehensive survey of the English first instance cases and summarised the position regarding lock-up agreements as follows (at [98]): “… a consent fee … will not fracture a class provided that it is made available to all scheme creditors, and provided also that it does not induce creditors to commit to vote in favour of a scheme which they might otherwise reject.” The general tenor of cases in England indicates that the mere fact that a benefit is conferred on some creditors who enter into lock-up agreements to vote in favour of a scheme is insufficient to require those creditors to be constituted as a separate class, and the overall inquiry is a highly fact-specific one (see <span class="font-italic">Re Seat Pagine Gialle SPA</span> [2012] EWHC 3686 (Ch) at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, caution had also been expressed in <span class="font-italic">Re Sunbird Business Services Ltd</span> [2021] 2 All ER (Comm) 1019 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Sunbird</span>”) (at [115]–[116])<span class="font-italic"> </span>regarding the increasing prevalence of lock-up agreements:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115 The widespread use of lock-up agreements in recent years is, however, not without difficulties. One such concern (not present in the instant case) relates to the payment of lock-up fees. In many schemes, the company might offer to pay a fee to induce scheme creditors to enter into a legally binding agreement at an early stage to support the proposed scheme. The payment of such fees has been accepted in a number of cases at first instance, but serious concerns remain … Questions may well arise as to whether the payment of such fees should either result in the court ordering separate class meetings for those who have locked-up (and may thus be unable to change their mind absent a material change of circumstances) and those who have not; or otherwise as to the reliability of a majority vote comprising creditors in receipt of a lock-up fee and those who have not qualified to receive it.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 A second concern, which is relevant in this case, relates to the unequal provision of information to different groups of creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Re Sunbird</span>, Snowden J refused to sanction the scheme of arrangement despite the majority vote of the creditors. Amongst the various reasons cited was the fact that some majority creditors were misinformed (being hastily urged into signing the lock-up agreements) and were misled into signing the lock-up agreement under the erroneous impression that this was a requirement necessary to satisfy the court: <span class="font-italic">Re Sunbird</span> at [121].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 While there is good commercial sense in offering lock-up agreements in conjunction with proposed schemes as it could “avoid a potential waste of time and costs of starting the scheme process” (<span class="font-italic">Re Sunbird</span> at [114]), the court must be cognizant of the attendant risks as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Hong Kong authorities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Re Winsway Enterprises Holdings Ltd</span> [2017] 1 HKLRD 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Winsway</span>”), the Hong Kong Court of First Instance appeared to agree with the English position in <span class="font-italic">Re DX Holdings </span>regarding whether creditors who enter lock-up agreements should be classed separately when voting on a scheme (at [20]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 … the question will normally be the same: is the right to be paid an additional sum likely to influence materially a scheme creditor in deciding how to vote? Whether or not it may is likely to depend on whether or not the sum is substantial and has been offered in a manner, which creditors are likely to consider fair regardless of whether or not they took advantage of the opportunity to agree in advance to vote in favour of the restructuring. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Harris J held that, on the facts of that case, there was no need to place the creditors who entered into lock-up agreements in a separate voting class from the rest as the consent fee of 2.0% is relatively small, the agreements were made available to all scheme creditors and it was a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> attempt to introduce certainty in the restructuring process: <span class="font-italic">Re Winsway</span> at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Similarly, in the more recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Da Sen Holdings Group Ltd </span>[2022] HKCU 324 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Da Sen</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [16]), it was observed that a payment of a consent fee will not fracture a class of creditors if the lock-up agreement was made available to all creditors and the consent fee offered would not have distorted the outcome of the voting. Harris J then held that a consent fee of 5.0% was not unusually large and would not alter the classification of creditors: <span class="font-italic">Re Da Sen</span> at [16]. This conclusion was made in the context where the unsecured creditors’ recovery under the scheme was estimated to be about 50.0%–60.0% and the recovery in a liquidation scenario (which was the appropriate comparator) was no more than 32.0%: <span class="font-italic">Re Da Sen</span> at [8].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legal position to be adopted in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my determination, lock-in agreements will generally not fracture a class when voting on a scheme of arrangement, subject to certain requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In determining the classification of creditors, the court considers any rights conferred or to be conferred in other agreements that are provided for under the terms of the scheme or which are conditional on the scheme: <span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia</span> at [58]. Hence, the presence of lock-up agreements with some creditors is relevant to the court’s consideration for the classification of creditors when voting on a scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The rationale for offering lock-up agreements to creditors in a proposed restructuring is to reduce the risk that the proposed scheme that is introduced will fall through due to it not being able to garner the necessary statutory majority support: <span class="font-italic">Re Winsway</span> at [20]. There can be significant savings of time and costs if properly employed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Lock-up agreements (with their accompanying benefits, <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>consent fees payable) are undeniably designed to provide some material inducement for creditors to commit on their voting intentions so that the company proposing a scheme would not embark on the process in vain without sufficient support: <span class="font-italic">Re ColourOz</span> at [97]. It cannot be the case that the entering into lock-up agreements by creditors, in and of itself, would mean that those creditors must be classed separately when voting. One must be careful not to fracture a class too easily without a clear dissimilarity of rights such that minority creditors in another class would have a disproportionate right of veto (see <span class="font-italic">Re Noble</span> at [158]). The classification of creditors remains a perennially thorny issue given the myriad contexts which might arise (see the <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review </span><span class="font-italic">Committee</span> (2013) at pp 138–139, para 11). Hence, the assessment must remain a fact-specific one with all the circumstances considered <span class="font-italic">in toto</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Distilling the assistance from the cases in England and Hong Kong, the following, non-exhaustive, principles are to my mind relevant in determining whether creditors who enter into lock-up agreements should be classed separately for the purposes of voting on a scheme of arrangement, even for the notional tabulation of votes under s 71 of the IRDA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While the benefits that can be conferred on creditors who enter into lock-up agreements are varied, the most common of which are the payment of consent fees, the critical question in every case is whether the benefit conferred is so sizeable that it would have a significant influence on the decision of a reasonable creditor when voting for the proposed scheme. In assessing whether there was a significant influence, one would look at the relative size of the consent fee (or benefit) when compared to the forecasted returns to creditors under the implemented scheme and the estimated recovery in liquidation (or another appropriate comparator).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The lock-up agreement must have been made available to all scheme creditors within the relevant class such that they were all given the equal right to enter into the agreement, and the agreements made with each creditor must be on substantially the same terms. Beyond that, whether a creditor chooses to exercise that right to enter into the lock-up agreement is beyond a scheme company’s control.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The use of the lock-up agreement must be done <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, no misleading of creditors). It is trite that the court will not sanction a scheme if the company and/or its majority creditors are not acting <span class="font-italic">bona </span><span class="font-italic">fide</span>: <span class="font-italic">TT International (No 1)</span> at [74]. This applies with equal force in the context of s 71 of the IRDA: <span class="font-italic">Re DSG Asia</span> at [66]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts – classification of Locked-in Creditors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Applying the principles set out above to the facts at hand, I determined that there was no need to place the Locked-in Creditors in a separate class from the other Non-Locked-in Creditors for the purpose of determining whether the notional voting outcomes satisfied the statutory majority requirements, and the reliability of the notional majority vote was not compromised. I found that the Scheme Creditors whose votes were solicited for the notional voting outcomes were fairly representative of the class of creditors to which they belong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Regarding the size of the BOHL Consent Fee offered, the question was whether it is so sizeable that it would have a significant influence on the decision of a reasonable creditor when voting for the proposed scheme. When compared to the figures in the abovementioned cases like <span class="font-italic">Re Codere</span> and<span class="font-italic"> Re Da Sen</span>, to my mind, the consent fee of 1.0% of the Scheme Creditor’s admitted debt would not be so significant as compared to the potential recovery of 12.0% under the BPS Scheme and a 0.2% recovery in liquidation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 By acceding to the BPS Scheme compared to the recovery in liquidation, there is a potential 60-fold recovery of the admitted debt value which would have been sufficient commercial justification alone for the Scheme Creditors to vote in favour of the BPS Scheme. In these circumstances, even without the additional BOHL Consent Fee of 1.0%, it is foreseeable that a reasonable creditor would have voted in favour of the scheme regardless. There is little reason to think that the voting outcomes were distorted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 At this juncture, I caution that such an assessment is not one that is based purely on numerical comparison but must be done contextually, taking into account the other reasons as to why a reasonable creditor might enter the scheme and compromise on their debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Next, the BOHL Lock-up Agreements were offered as a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>attempt, as part of the BPS Scheme, to introduce certainty into the restructuring process.

</div> It is also important that the lock-up agreement does not mislead creditors as to what could be recovered under the proposed scheme of arrangement. I noted that the expected recovery under the scheme was described in the BOHL Lock-up Agreements to be “between 8.8% and 18.1%” of the admitted debt, whereas it was stated that there would be “no recovery” in liquidation.

</div> This is not too far off from the eventual 12.0% and 0.2% recovery that was estimated by BPS in the respective scenarios. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As an aside, some of the English authorities suggests that it is appropriate for lock-up agreements to include a provision that allows a signatory to terminate the agreement and cease to support the scheme in the event of a “material adverse change” to the company’s financial position (see <span class="font-italic">Re ColourOz</span> at [94]). This would ensure that a creditor is not irrevocably bound in all circumstances. I noted that within the BOHL Lock-up Agreement, there was no such clause.

</div> My tentative view is that while the presence of such a provision in the lock-up agreement goes towards the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> and fairness of the arrangement, this is not a mandatory requirement.

</div> Nevertheless, I agree broadly with the Applicant’s submissions that TPCL’s legal rights against BOHL in respect of the guarantee is distinct and independent from TPCL’s legal rights against BPS regarding the unsecured loans. It is trite that each incorporated entity has a separate legal personality with distinct legal rights and liabilities, and this principle applies to companies within an ownership group as well: <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 592 at [71].
