Second, while the AR noted the plaintiff’s averment that the first defendant’s withdrawal of US$2.85m from the Company’s OCBC account was a breach of fiduciary duties, the AR found that this averment not only failed to disclose any particulars as to the element of “fraud”, but also assumed the presence of “fraudulent conduct”, the very existence of which was incumbent on the Plaintiff to raise in the first place (at [10]–[11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 At a further hearing on 2 April 2020, the AR dismissed the amendment application in SUM 6349 as both parties agreed that the amendment application was dependent on the results of SUM 5936 and SUM 6251.

Unlike the United Kingdom and Canada, the common law derivative action was not expressly abolished in Singapore with the introduction of s 216A of the Companies Act (see the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Petroships Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1022 (“<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>”) at [67]). Whether an aggrieved individual may (in the case of an unlisted company) choose to commence a common law derivative action in place of the statutory derivative action and whether the latter may co-exist with, or has (instead) been abrogated by the former were questions expressly left open by the Court of Appeal (see <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">etroships </span>at [70] and <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law </span>(LexisNexis, 2019) (Issue 14) (“<span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law</span>”) at para 557). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 That said, the Court of Appeal provided guidance as to how a court should deal with such an aggrieved individual in the interim (at [71]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">What does appear clear, however, is that, as a matter of practicality, it does not seem efficient or effective for a party to initiate a common law derivative action when a statutory derivative action pursuant to s 216A is available.</span> As Margaret Chew has perceptively observed (see <span class="font-italic">Chew </span>at p 324; <span class="font-italic">cf Walter Woon on Company Law</span> at para 9.73):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… However, it would be unusual for a complainant, for practical reasons, to ignore section 216A and to pursue the convoluted course of a common law derivative action, since section 216A provides, at the least, a clear, simplified and efficient procedure. Furthermore, in an application pursuant to section 216A, it is submitted that the onus does not lie on the complainant to show a ‘fraud on the minority’, in particular, wrongdoer control. Therefore, from the pragmatic point of view, it would seem to be in the interests of the complainant to pursue a statutory derivative action where he is a member of an unlisted company. <span class="font-weight-bold">Where a complainant chooses to forego the simplified statutory derivative action route, and opts (in the case of an unlisted company) to launch an application to pursue a derivative action by the common law route, the question then has to be with what motive the action is pursued.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Where such a motive may be classified as one that is ulterior and the complainant is held not to be approaching the courts with ‘clean hands,’ should an alternative remedy be available (for instance, the statutory derivative action), it is conceivable that proceeding under the common law may be considered an abuse of process.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Ng for the plaintiff did not take the position that the statutory derivative action was not available to the plaintiff to seek the return of the US$2.85m to the Company (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the only remedy sought in the SOC insofar as the derivative claim was concerned). Instead, Mr Ng contended that there was no abuse of process for the plaintiff to prefer the common law derivative action for three reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the law allowed the plaintiff to choose his cause of action (see <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>at [71]).

Instead, Ms Aw contended that the reasons given by the plaintiff for choosing the common law route were unconvincing, and the evidence demonstrated that the plaintiff had an ulterior motive. Ms Aw, therefore, called into question the plaintiff’s motives in opting to commence a common law derivative action against the first and second defendants.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On this preliminary question, I agreed with Ms Aw that that the plaintiff’s professed reasons were unconvincing, especially since a clear alternative remedy was available to him in the form of the statutory derivative action via s 216A of the Companies Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, a simple assertion that the law allowed the plaintiff a choice as to which route to employ did not answer the more material question of <span class="font-italic">why </span>he chose to employ the common law route, which is at the heart of the inquiry referred to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>(see [23] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, as mentioned above at [11], the Mareva injunction sought by the plaintiff was against the <span class="font-italic">personal assets of the first defendant </span>and not of the Company. It was therefore irrelevant to the common law derivative action commenced by the plaintiff and the relief sought for the return to the Company of the moneys in the Company’s OCBC bank account. Even if I were to assume that giving notice to the defendants under the s 216A route would undermine the Mareva injunction application, the plaintiff could have applied to the court to dispense with the notice requirement under s 216A(4) of the Companies Act (see <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2011] 3 SLR 980 at [13]). The plaintiff’s reply to this point was to simply reiterate that the law allowed him a choice as to the type of derivative action to launch and that the personal and derivative claims were “inextricably linked”.

</div>  Alternatively, in my view, it was also open to the plaintiff to commence <span class="font-italic">separate</span> actions, distinguishing between his personal claims against the first and second defendants and the derivative claim made in his representative capacity.  The giving of notice under s 216A for the derivative claim would then not have alerted the first or second defendants to the plaintiff’s separate personal claims or to any <span class="font-italic">ex</span><span class="font-italic"> parte</span> Mareva injunction application taken out by the plaintiff in connection with his personal claims.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Third, it is invariably the case that a minority shareholder who seeks to bring an action on behalf of the company against directors who have the support of majority shareholders (or who are themselves majority shareholders) will face opposition from the majority. Section 216A of the Companies Act applies in precisely such a situation, in providing a “clear, simplified and efficient procedure” as compared to the “convoluted course of a common law derivative action” (<span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>([22] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [71]). The plaintiff’s argument (at [24(c)] was, therefore, somewhat circular and did not provide a satisfactory answer to the question posed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I thus found it difficult to appreciate why the plaintiff had eschewed the statutory derivative action in favour of commencing a common law derivative action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In addition to having no good reason for eschewing the more convenient alternative route of a statutory derivative action, it appeared to me that the plaintiff did have an ulterior motive for commencing a common law derivative action. However, having said that, I defer my analysis on this point as the facts relevant to motive were also relevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion whether to grant leave for the plaintiff to bring the common law derivative action.  I thus analyse these points in greater detail under the main issue (see below at [69] onwards). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In any event, I observe that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>at [71] did not definitively state that a common law derivative action commenced by a plaintiff would invariably constitute an abuse of process (and hence be liable to be struck out) in circumstances where the plaintiff could also avail itself of an alternative remedy and had, therefore, seemingly brought the common law derivative action with ulterior motives. Ultimately, therefore, the Registrar’s Appeals hinged on the main issue, which I now turn to consider.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The main issue: viability of the common law derivative action </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legal requirements of a common law derivative action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It is an entrenched principle of company law that the proper plaintiff to sue in respect of alleged wrong done to a company is the company itself: this is famously known as the proper plaintiff rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>(1843) 2 Hare 461 (“<span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As observed in <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law</span> at para 658, such a rule breaks down completely when the wrongdoing defendants are in control of the company and are thereby in a position to prevent the company from bringing the suit. To get around this problem, the English courts developed a procedural mechanism to allow a minority shareholder to sue the defendants in a representative capacity: the common law derivative action. The minority shareholder commences an action in his own name but seeks to enforce the rights of the company. The shareholder can only claim remedies or reliefs that the company is entitled to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In order to bring a claim under a common law derivative action, the plaintiff must fulfil the following procedural requirements (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahim bin Aki v Krubong Industrial Park (Melaka) Sdn Bhd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1995] 3 MLJ 417 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahim</span>”) at 427, as cited in <span class="font-italic">Venkatraman Kalyanaraman v Nithya Kalyani and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1365 at [69]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A minority shareholder must bring an action on behalf of himself and all the other shareholders of the company, excluding the majority wrongdoers. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The wrongdoers must be named as defendants. The company must be joined as a defendant so that it is bound by the result of the action. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The statement of claim must disclose that it is a derivative action, and recite the facts that make it so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In addition to the procedural requirements, there are two substantive requirements that must also be satisfied before the court will consider granting leave to a minority shareholder to commence a derivative action on behalf of a company (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Morten Innhaug </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Sinwa</span>”) at [20]). These are: (a) the company has a reasonable case against the defendant(s); and (b) the minority shareholder-plaintiff has <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the common law derivative action in the name of the company. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Requirement (a) is fulfilled if the minority-shareholder plaintiff demonstrates that the company has, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>basis, a reasonable or legitimate case against the defendant for which the company may recover damages or otherwise obtain relief (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [22]). In this regard, the court will not undertake an extensive inquiry into the merits of the claim. It will however ascertain whether the case brought in the company’s name has a semblance of merit after having regard to the affidavits filed by both parties in support of their claims and the evidence presented before the court (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [23]). In other words, or in striking out parlance, the leave application will be denied if it appears that the intended action is frivolous or vexatious or is bound to be unsuccessful (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Requirement (b) is fulfilled if the minority-shareholder plaintiff is able to show that he falls within the “fraud on the minority” exception to the proper plaintiff rule (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [47]–[48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Even if all the substantive and procedural requirements are met, the court retains an overall discretion to decide whether to grant leave to commence a derivative action (<span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis and my decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The defendants did not seriously dispute the plaintiff’s contention

</div> Quite apart from the unfairness occasioned by the belated nature of this new alleged “head of loss”, the absence of affidavit evidence meant that the claim for alleged loss of interest lacked any evidential basis. The absence of evidence, in turn, manifested itself in the speculative language used to describe this alleged loss in the plaintiff’s submissions. For example, the plaintiff claimed that it was a loss because “the [first] and/or [second defendants] did not aver or make any deposition that they will return the interest earned … since the transfer in May 2019.”

</div> In or around May/June 2019, NTUC had informed the second defendant by email that the US subsidiary had been shortlisted as a potential supplier, and invited the US subsidiary to provide a quote for the supply to NTUC of seedless grapes from the USA. In an email reply dated 6 June 2019, the second defendant, on behalf of the US subsidiary, acknowledged that the US subsidiary would participate in the selection process.

</div> The plaintiff made much ado about the fact that the defendants refused his recent request for the sum to be returned to the Company (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>after the hearing before the AR). With respect, there was no obligation on the part of the first and second defendants to oblige this request (made after this litigation was commenced).

As mentioned at [41] above, the plaintiff’s complaint relating to the transfer was linked to his complaint regarding the failure of the Company to pay Shida. In essence, the plaintiff’s view was that the money should have been used to pay Shida, and this would then have obviated the need to defend the suit brought by Shida against the Company.

</div> In respect of (a), any transfer of shares, even if fraudulent, did not speak to any claim or relief that the Company could have pursued against the first and/or second defendant. A common law derivative action, properly so-called, is an action to enforce the Company’s rights, not those of the minority shareholder.

The plaintiff based his case off the transfer of the US$2.85m to the Company’s US subsidiary. However, on the evidence available, this was, in and of itself, neither an illegitimate transaction which constituted a loss to the Company, nor a transaction which resulted in a personal benefit to the first and second defendants.

</div> Further, the SOC did not contain <span class="font-italic">any</span> pleading in respect of the plaintiff’s claim that the first and second defendants had benefitted personally from the interest earned on the sum. Such a claim was, as I have said, speculative (see above at [45]). The plaintiff had thus failed to plead the necessary particulars of “fraud” in respect of the claim for the transfer of the US$2.85m.  The essence of a derivative claim, shorn of its frills and even at its lowest, must still demonstrate some semblance of “abuse or misuse of power” or “fraud on a power” by the wrongdoer (<span class="font-italic">Ting Sing </span><span class="font-italic">Ning </span>([60(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[13]).  In my view, the plaintiff had failed to meet even this threshold. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Fifth, I agreed with the defendants that the plaintiff’s case, at best, was that he had pleaded an alleged breach of fiduciary duties in respect of the transfer of the US$2.85m which in turn constituted “fraud”.

</div> In this regard, I agree with <span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte L</span><span class="font-italic">td and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others </span>[2017] SGHCR 8 at [38] that a mere allegation of breach of fiduciary duties in the pleadings does not automatically lead to an allegation of fraud. Such a broad notion of fraud would make a mockery of the proper plaintiff rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle </span>as well as the cogent policy reasons behind it (see <span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [22]). It would potentially allow any disgruntled minority shareholder to commence and maintain a common law derivative action so long as the alleged wrongdoers had conducted themselves in a way that could then be couched in language (in a pleading), however obtuse, to resemble a breach of fiduciary duties. This would, in my view, open the door to abuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For these reasons, I concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> for leave to maintain a common law derivative action.  He had failed to plead the material facts demonstrating the constituent element of fraud, or that “fraud” existed in the first place. The second substantive requirement was accordingly also not met by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For completeness, I would add that I had also considered the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff’s application for leave to maintain a common law derivative action in SUM 6251 was procedurally irregular as it was expressed to be taken out pursuant to O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court.

</div>
</div>
</div> The law is clear that the question of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring a derivative action should be decided as a preliminary point. The application should normally be made under O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court for trial of a preliminary issue, or determined as part of an O 18 r 19 striking out application (see <span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [15] citing <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law </span>at paras 9.60–9.62 with approval). While I had my reservations about the propriety of the plaintiff bringing the leave application under O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court, this procedural point was ultimately rendered academic.  It was unnecessary for me to decide on it given that the question of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>was raised in the course of the striking out application in SUM 5936.  Even if it had been a procedural irregularity, I would not have been inclined to exercise my discretion under O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court to cure the irregularity. Given my decision that the plaintiff had failed to establish the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>which meant that his application for leave also failed, it would be pointless to cure any procedural irregularity in the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The plaintiff’s motives and the court’s discretion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, I also considered if I should exercise my discretion to grant leave <span class="font-italic">assuming</span> the plaintiff had successfully met the procedural and substantive requirements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As mentioned at [35], the common law derivative action is a procedural device invented by the courts to enable justice to be done when a company had been wronged by miscreant directors or shareholders. A minority member has no right to bring a derivative action; rather, it is a matter of grace (see <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporation</span><span class="font-italic">s Law</span> at para 503). Accordingly, in order to be considered worthy of that grace, the maxim “he who comes to equity must come with clean hands” applies to the aggrieved minority member. Thus, he who seeks to maintain a derivative action must do so in the best interests of the company and not for any ulterior purpose (see <span class="font-italic">Sinwa </span>at [69]).  To borrow the words of Ang J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Sinwa</span> at [70], the court will consider if the plaintiff has “laid all [his] cards on the table”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This was not a case that warranted the exercise of my discretion as the plaintiff did not appear, in my view, to be acting in the best interests of the Company, but rather in pursuit of his own ulterior purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The timeline of the relevant events leading up to Suit 1009 was telling. The transfer of the sum of US$2.85m occurred in May and July 2019. However, the plaintiff waited for close to four months before commencing Suit 1009 in October 2019. This was about a month after the first defendant had commenced divorce proceedings against the plaintiff in China and the further proceedings to recover spousal assets (see [5] above).
