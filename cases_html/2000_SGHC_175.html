<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The couple involved in this appeal were

married in March 1993 and divorced in April 1999. They have two sons aged five and two and

a half respectively.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. When the ancillary matters were heard

in the Family Court in January this year, the District Judge made orders to the following

effect:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) the wife was granted custody of the

  sons and the husband continued to have access in accordance with a previous interim order;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) the husband had to pay the wife $1,200

  per month as maintenance for herself and the two children;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) the matrimonial flat was ordered to be

  surrendered to the HDB; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) each party was allowed to retain

  his/her respective CPF monies.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The husband appealed against the first

three orders. In relation to the children, he wanted joint custody, alternatively,

increased access. Whilst wanting the maintenance payment to be reduced to $500 per month

and be in respect of the children only, he was also willing to pay half their school fees

right up to the tertiary level. Thirdly, in relation to the flat, in his notice of appeal

the husband asked for the wife to be ordered to transfer all her right, title and interest

in it to him in consideration of him paying her 50% of the ‘net value’ of the

flat as defined by him. In consideration of such payment, the wife was to forego all

claims for maintenance for herself.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The appeal was first heard before me on

13 April. I confirmed the custody order made by the District Judge but varied the access

arrangements. In relation to maintenance, I allowed the husband’s appeal in part by

varying the order in that I reduced the maintenance payable from $1,200 for the wife and

children to $800 for the children and $200 for the wife. This was a net reduction of $200.

As there was not sufficient information about the value of the matrimonial flat in order

to make a decision, I adjourned this issue to 11 May in order to enable the parties to

obtain a valuation. Subsequently, the wife wrote in for further arguments on the question

of maintenance and I acceded to her request. She also filed an affidavit outlining her

expenses and income situation. In the event, these issues were fixed to be heard together

with the submissions on the flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. At the hearing on 11 May I was informed

that the valuation of the flat had only been received the previous day and that the wife

was suggesting a global settlement. The matter was further adjourned to 22 May to allow

parties to explore this opportunity. Unfortunately, no settlement was reached. Having been

unable to achieve a settlement, the wife filed a further affidavit on 19 May, this one

dealing with the matrimonial flat. The husband filed a reply on 22 May and as the wife

wanted to file a further reply, the matter was adjourned to 26 May.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. On 26 May, the hearing proceeded on the

issues of the division of the flat and maintenance. After taking time for consideration, I

made my decision on 31 May 2000. I allowed the husband’s appeal in relation to the

matrimonial flat and set aside the order below directing the parties to surrender the flat

to the HDB. I further ordered the wife to transfer her right, title and interest to the

flat to the husband upon the husband paying her such sum as was equivalent to 43% of the

amount derived by deducting the outstanding loan due on the flat as at the date of

transfer from the commercial value of the flat pegged at $480,000. I further ordered that

if the husband did not submit the application for transfer to the HDB within four months

of my order he was to pay the wife interest on the amount due to her calculated at 6% per

annum. In relation to maintenance, I confirmed my order of 13 April. Finally, I ordered

the wife to pay a portion of the husband’s costs of appeal fixed at $3,000. The wife

has appealed against all of these orders.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Maintenance</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. In October 1999, when the parties first

filed their affidavits in relation to the ancillary matters, both parties were in steady

employment and earning regular incomes. The husband was an industrial engineer with a

gross monthly salary of $4,000 and a take home pay of $3,200. He estimated his expenses as

being $2,929 per month and this included expenditure on his children when they were with

him, an allowance for his parents and transport costs. He resided in the matrimonial flat

and the instalments for the flat were met in equal parts by contributions from his and the

wife’s CPF monies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The wife was also an industrial

engineer. At the time of the hearing, she and the children were living with her sister and

brother-in-law and their children. The wife received a gross pay of $3,574 and after

deductions for CPF ($714) and an item called ESPP, her take-home pay each month amounted

to $2,499.60. She put her own monthly and household expenses at $1,542. This included

salary and levy for the maid amounting to $700, food of $400 and transport of $200. She

estimated the children’s monthly expenses as coming to $1,599 per month, a figure

that the husband challenged. He considered their expenses to be not more than $800 a

month.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. In an affidavit filed in late December

1999, the wife stated that she had been given notice that her services with her then

employer would no longer be required and that she would be retrenched with effect from 31

January 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. The learned District Judge awarded a

total sum of $1,200 as monthly maintenance for the wife and children as she was of the

view that this amount was reasonable in the light of the wife and children’s

expenses. This was a sum that was well within the husband’s capabilities considering

that he took home $3,200 a month. The District Judge noted that monthly he spent $950 on

his car and some $300 on insurance policies. She was obviously of the view that these were

luxuries and the expenditure could, if necessary, be reduced so as to allow him to meet

his maintenance obligations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. When I first heard the appeal on this

issue, the material before me was the same as that which had been before the District

Judge. At that stage, I considered that the children’s expenses had been somewhat

inflated by the wife and that at the tender ages of five and two, they were unlikely to

require as many expensive classes as she had put in her list. I thought it would also be

useful to distinguish between the maintenance paid for the children and that paid for the

wife as these were separate issues and a lump sum would have a tax impact that could be

reduced if separate awards were made. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The children’s monthly expenses

as itemised by the wife were as follows:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. Looking at that list, I considered the

expenses to be on the high side especially in relation to entertainment, stationery and

books, swimming classes and tuition. The items listed as ‘pocket money’ and

‘savings for children’ were unnecessary. I considered that $1,200 a month would

be more than adequate to maintain these children at this stage. Once they went to primary

school, the expenses might increase but, for the moment, the sum would be sufficient. I

also considered that the father should bear a higher proportion of the children’s

expenses than the mother should since he was the higher income earner. I therefore ordered

him to pay $800 a month as their maintenance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. As for the wife’s expenses, I

considered that most of these could be met from her own income. The husband, however,

should contribute to her maintenance as he was in a financial position to do so and the

wife should be able to maintain a reasonable standard of living. For the time being I

considered a contribution of $200 a month from the husband to be sufficient. In this

connection, I noted that although the wife had been retrenched from her previous

employment, the terms of the entrenchment were generous. She was entitled to receive one

month’s salary for each year of service with her former employer. As she had worked

there since 1989, this amounted to about ten months’ salary. Further, she would get

compensation for accumulated leave. Although she had been retrenched, it seemed unlikely

that the wife would be unemployed for long. At that stage, the wife appeared to be well

capable of continuing to earn a decent living. She also had considerable financial

resources.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. As stated earlier, on 28 April, the

wife filed a further affidavit. In this, she set out tables of the family’s revised

monthly expenses with effect from January 2000. In total these amounted to $4,131.83 an

increase of almost $1,000 or 31.5% over the figures given only seven months earlier. The

wife also gave information about her then employment position. She stated that she was

working as a software engineer on a three-month contract ending on 20 May 2000. As such,

she earned a basic salary of $2,300 per month and had a net salary of $1,839 per month.

She had been employed on a project basis and had flexible hours. She had a certain quota

of work to complete a day, which she did by working on her computer at home.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. When the issue of maintenance was

brought up again on 26 May, I had to consider whether I should restore the District

Judge’s order on maintenance or whether the variation I had made to that order should

stand. There was no question of my raising the total amount awarded as maintenance since

the wife had not appealed against the lower court’s decision. Despite having filed an

affidavit that showed an apparent increase in her expenses, the wife made little attempt

to argue that the original maintenance order should be restored. Instead, her main focus

was the flat and through her counsel she indicated that she was willing to waive all claim

for maintenance for herself and the children in return for an order that the flat be

transferred to her on the basis that she had a 50% share in it and would pay the husband

accordingly.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. Looking through the wife’s

affidavit of 18 April, I noted that instead of claiming an expense of $700 a month for the

maid’s employment expenses, she claimed a sum of $600 a month as a fee paid to her

sister for the use of the maid’s services and lodging. It turned out that the maid

was employed by the sister rather than the wife. Then there was a substantial increase in

the family’s food needs: from $610 in October to $1,350 in April (calculated on the

basis of five dollars per person per meal per day for each of three daily meals). Her

expenditure on insurance policies had increased by $100 and she also claimed the cost of

course fees at $5,253 per annum or $487.75 per month.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. As for the children, the older

child’s expenses came up to $519 a month of which $126 was for toys and outings and

$50 was for books and stationery whilst the younger’s came up to $487 a month of

which $80 was for entertainment and $35 for books and study aids. Even on the revised

figures, the children’s expenses totalled only $1,006 (including milk powder but

excluding other food). Once food costs were added, I estimated her expenditure on the boys

would not exceed $1,300. The maintenance award I had made was not out of line with these

expenses and I did not think it was necessary to change it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. As for the wife’s own expenses,

it seemed to me that she was re-calculating them for maximum benefit. I could not

understand how they could have changed so much in a few months especially considering that

over those few months her income had, according to her, gone down. Yet her expenditure had

increased. The wife produced a receipt from a computer school showing that she had paid

them fees of $3,283.64 in December 1999 and a receipt from the Singapore Institute of

Management dated 20 January 2000 for $5,253 which was apparently charged to her as fees

for three separate courses. It appeared that the wife had decided to undertake these

courses after the divorce. There was no explanation as to why she had found it necessary

to do this (or take so many courses) and whilst professional upgrading is always a

commendable undertaking, I did not think that in the present circumstances she could use

the expenditure to justify a reinstatement of the original maintenance order. In any case,

it was clear that the wife was quite willing to give up maintenance from the husband in

return for the flat. It appeared to me that in making this offer, she must have done her

sums and decided that she was able to support herself even if she had to forego any

contribution from the husband. In that light, I considered there was no good reason why I

should vary the decision I had made on maintenance on 13 April.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The matrimonial flat</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. The matrimonial flat was unit #14-644

at Block 587 Hougang Avenue 4. It was purchased in January 1997 and thus at the time of

the ancillary hearing, five years had not elapsed from the date of purchase. Accordingly,

it could not be sold in the open market. The learned District Judge held that in these

circumstances, the flat had no market value. She also noted that the wife would not be in

a financial position to keep the flat and assume the mortgage loan of over $200,000. In

fact the wife had not even asked for this. Neither could the husband retain the flat

because he did not have a family nucleus. That being the case, the learned District Judge

decided that the flat was not an asset that could be divided between the parties and the

only option left to her was to order that it be surrendered to the HDB.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. The husband’s position on appeal

was that he would be able to form the family nucleus needed to take over the flat as his

parents were willing to sell their own flat and move in with him. He therefore wanted the

District Judge’s decision set aside and the wife ordered to transfer her share in the

flat to him. It should be noted that his original submission that the flat should be

transferred to him was based on his application for custody of the children, which, if

successful, would have given him the required family nucleus. At the hearing below, once

it was decided that custody should remain with the wife, the husband did not, apparently,

qualify to retain the flat. By the time the matter was heard before me, however, the

situation had changed. The HDB had indicated that they would be willing to regard the

husband and his parents as a family unit as long as the parents sold their existing flat.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. The wife’s initial position as

shown in the submissions of her counsel tendered on 13 April was that the decision of the

District Judge was correct as the wife had obtained custody of the children and the

husband was unable to form a separate family nucleus. She also submitted that she would

not be in a financial position to retain the flat and thus the only option open to the

court was to confirm the surrender of the flat to the HDB.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. By the time the issue of the division

of the flat was argued at length on 26 May, the wife had completely changed her position.

She now wanted the flat to be transferred to her on the basis that she needed a home for

herself and the children and that this would be the best home. She was willing to forego

maintenance for herself and the children if the court would order that the transfer take

place on the basis of each party having an equal share in the premises. It should be noted

here that the husband was willing to allow the wife an equal share in the flat if it was

transferred to him and she agreed to forego maintenance. If not, he considered that her

interest in it did not exceed 35%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. Since the parties were now actively

disputing each other’s share in the flat, my first task was to determine what

financial contributions each of them had made to its acquisition. The wife calculated her

contributions as amounting to $87,104.74 whilst the husband’s contributions were

$124,818.06. In coming to these totals, she attributed the amount of $70,000, which had

been spent on renovating the flat, to the parties in equal shares. This sum had been

derived from the parties’ gains from the sale of an earlier flat at Bedok and the

wife’s contention was that they were equally entitled to these. In terms of direct

contributions therefore, the wife averred that she had contributed 41% of the cost of

acquisition of the flat and the husband had contributed 58%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. The husband did not accept that the

proceeds of sale of the Bedok flat belonged equally to the parties. He calculated his

contributions to the acquisition of that flat as amounting to $40,000 (67% of the cost),

made up of $27,000 from CPF and $13,000 cash contribution. He put the wife’s

contributions at $20,000 (33%) coming entirely from CPF. In her affidavit in reply the

wife accepted that the husband had contributed $40,000 to the Bedok flat in the manner

asserted by him. She, however, disagreed that her contribution had been only $20,000. She

said that the payment from her CPF funds had been $20,709.50. Additionally, she had paid

$1,000 as a cash deposit, a further $5,000 in cash and the agent’s fee of $660. The

documents which the wife produced showed that she had withdrawn $3,000 from her savings

account in October 1992 and a further $660, described as agent’s fees, in December

1992. She also produced evidence from the CPF Board showing the withdrawal of $20,709.50.

All in all, the wife was able to show a contribution of $24,369.50 to the Bedok flat. This

meant she had contributed 37.8% of its cost and the husband had contributed 62.2%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. Coming back to the matrimonial flat, I

accepted that the wife’s share of the $70,000 spent on renovation was $26,600 (having

rounded up the 37.8% to 38%) and thus together with her CPF contributions she had

contributed altogether $66,419.06. As for the husband, I took his CPF contributions of

$83,267.57 and added the sum of $47,400 representing his share of the renovation cost and

the sum of $8,000 that he had paid in cash. This $8,000 was evidenced to my satisfaction

by the husband’s POSB account book. The husband’s total contribution was

therefore $134,667.37. In terms of percentage therefore, the wife contributed 33% and the

husband 67%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. I next had to consider the wife’s

non-financial contributions. She asked the court to take into account the following

factors:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) after she left the matrimonial flat in

  October 1998, the husband had rent free occupation of the flat;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) he paid no maintenance for the

  children and her until the ancillary orders were made in January 2000;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) she had been and still was the

  children’s primary care giver.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. I noted that this was a relatively

short marriage: the parties lived together for five and a half years. Throughout the

marriage, the wife held down a full time job. Once the children came, they were looked

after by babysitters for substantial periods though the main responsibility remained with

the wife especially when the husband was away in 1995/1996. After the wife left the

matrimonial home, the children were cared for by the husband and his parents until June

1999 when she was able to gain their custody pursuant to an interim custody order to which

the husband consented. In the circumstances, I put the wife’s non-financial

contribution to the marriage at ten percent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. The matrimonial flat is an executive

apartment with a floor area of approximately 140 square metres. It has three bedrooms, a

study, a storeroom, two bathrooms, a living cum dining and a kitchen. The valuation

carried out in April 2000 valued it at $480,000. This valuation was made on the basis of

what the flat would be considered worth if the parties wanted a mortgage loan. The flat

could not be valued on an open market basis as it was not saleable. At that time, the

outstanding mortgage loan was approximately $205,000. The equity which the parties had in

the flat was therefore worth around $275,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. As I had found that the wife should be

given a 43% share in the flat for both her financial and non-financial contributions to

the flat and the family, she would have had to pay the husband some $156,750 in order to

buy over his 57% share in it. The wife had urged me very strongly to let her take over the

flat by paying the husband only 50% of its equity value on the basis that she would forego

maintenance for herself and the boys. I did not accept this submission. The children are

young. Their expenses are likely to increase and I did not consider it correct to take

away their right to maintenance from their father at this early stage of their lives. The

wife might be confident of being able to support them in the future but one cannot

discount any number of contingencies happening which could either impair or remove her

ability to support the family. Further, the husband’s ability to support his children

might increase over time and if such an order was made it would prevent the children from

enjoying the fruits of such an increase in income.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. The wife also sought to impress upon

me that she had the better claim to the flat as the children needed a roof over their

heads. This was true. It was not in my judgment necessary, however, that they should have

that particular roof over their heads. They were young and adaptable and were not of an

age to be adversely affected by a change in homes. There was nothing to stop the wife from

purchasing a smaller but adequate flat in the resale market. In any case, until the appeal

she had not found it necessary to ask for the flat. She was quite content for it to go

back to the HDB and for herself and the boys to remain at her sister’s home for the

time being.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. In this case, there was no question of

selling the flat in the open market. It had to go to either the husband or the wife.

Whilst I could have ordered the husband to transfer his share in the flat to the wife in

return for payment of $156,750 or thereabouts, I did not consider that the wise course to

take. According to the submissions made on behalf of the wife in early April, she was not

in a financial position to retain the flat. Nothing had changed in May. Further, the

wife’s CPF monies were not sufficient to pay the husband off entirely. She would have

had to find cash of at least $50,000 and would also have to take on the burden of the

existing mortgage that was at that time being serviced equally by both parties. That would

have been a financial strain. I did not think it right to put the wife in that position.

On the face of it, the husband was the higher income earner and would find it easier to

service the loan. He would have also help from his parents. With the money that the wife

got from the husband and her existing funds in CPF, she would be in a very good position

to buy an adequate home for herself and the children without burdening herself too

greatly.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. For the above reasons, I allowed the

husband’s appeal in relation to the flat and ordered the wife to transfer her share

in it to him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. Having thought about the matter

further, there is one additional order that I should have made in order to be fair to the

wife. That is that the husband should, as from the date of my order, service 57% of the

monthly instalment due on the mortgage loan on the flat. Alternatively, he would at the

time of transfer have to reimburse her, in addition to her share in its equity, the total

excess amount she had contributed to all instalments from the date of my order. This,

however, is something that can be remedied by the appellate court if the wife does not

succeed in her appeal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Costs</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. The husband asked for the costs of the

appeal. He pointed out that he had largely succeeded in that he had obtained more liberal

access, the maintenance amount payable to the wife had been reduced and his appeal on the

matrimonial property had been allowed. Further, the wife had prolonged the appeal by

making further arguments on access and maintenance on which she did not succeed. I

considered that the husband had been largely successful in his appeal although he had

failed to change the custody order. I therefore ordered that the wife pay a portion of the

husband’s costs of appeal fixed at $3,000 which sum was to be deducted from the

entitlement in respect of the transfer of the flat.</font></p>
