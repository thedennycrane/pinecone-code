        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Aqua Art Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”), exercised an option
                    (“the Option”) to purchase five shophouses (“the
                    Properties”) from the vendor, Goodman Development (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“the Respondent”). However, the sale could not be completed
                    because the Properties were restricted residential properties under the
                    Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the RPA”)
                    and the Appellant, being a foreign company under the RPA, was ineligible to
                    purchase them. The Respondent thus forfeited the deposit of $308,800 which the
                    Appellant had paid and obtained a court order declaring the Option void under
                    s 3 of the RPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant subsequently commenced these proceedings to recover its deposit
                    and the Option fee of $77,200. The trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    dismissed the claim and the Appellant appealed to this Court (see <em>Aqua Art Pte Ltd v Goodman Development (S) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 4 SLR 86 (“the Judgment”)). After hearing the
                    arguments of both parties, we allowed the appeal and ordered the Respondent to
                    refund both the deposit and Option fee to the Appellant with interest at 4% from
                    the date of the writ. We now give the detailed reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant is a company incorporated in Singapore. It is engaged in the
                    restaurant business and is part of the IndoChine Group of companies.
                    Mr Michael Ma (“Ma”), an Australian citizen and Singapore
                    permanent resident, is a shareholder and director of the Appellant. The
                    Respondent is also a Singapore incorporated company and owned a row of five
                    units of two-storey shophouses at 306–314 Tanjong Katong Road. These
                    shophouses are the Properties referred to at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above. Although the Properties comprised multiple
                    shophouses, they were covered by a single certificate of title and thus had to
                    be sold as one unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 16 June 2007, Ma went to view the Properties which had been advertised
                    for sale as he was looking to invest in a commercial property for the
                    Appellant’s restaurant business. He was accompanied by his wife, his
                    property agent Ms Odelia Tan (“Tan”), his friend Andrew Neary
                    (“Neary”), and the Respondent’s property agent
                    Ms Katherine Poh (“Poh”). The actual events that occurred
                    during the viewing are disputed by the parties but what is undisputed is that Ma
                    was satisfied with the Properties and wanted to purchase them. Ma and Poh agreed
                    on a price of $7.72m and he accordingly handed her a cheque for $77,200 (being
                    1% of the purchase price) in consideration for an option to purchase (this is
                    the Option referred to above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>). The
                    Option stipulated that Ma or his nominee(s) was to be the purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is unclear from the facts whether the Option fee of $77,200 came from
                    Ma’s own funds or whether he was paying on behalf of the Appellant. The
                    Appellant in its pleadings had taken the position that it was the party who paid
                    the $77,200. The Respondent appeared to have accepted this although it
                    maintained that, at the time the $77,200 was paid, it did not know that the
                    Appellant was the prospective purchaser of the Properties. We thus proceeded on
                    the basis that it was the Appellant and not Ma who paid the Option fee of
                    $77,200.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant exercised the Option on 9 July 2007 and paid the Respondent
                    a sum of $308,800 (being 4% of the purchase price). The Appellant then lodged a
                    caveat against the Properties on 25 July 2007. Unfortunately, on
                    8 August 2007, the Appellant’s solicitors discovered that the
                    Properties were zoned “residential with commercial at 1st storey”
                    after a search was made with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the
                    URA”), making them restricted residential properties under the RPA. This
                    meant that the Appellant, being a company whose members and directors were not
                    all Singapore citizens, was ineligible to acquire the Properties under
                        s 3(1)(<em>c</em>) of the RPA without the approval
                    of the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit (“the LDAU”) of the Singapore
                    Land Authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Despite the results of the URA search, the Appellant was still committed in
                    going ahead with the sale and purchase of the Properties. To this end, its
                    solicitors advised that if the Properties were strata subdivided into ten
                    separate units, they would no longer be regarded as restricted residential
                    properties and the Appellant would be able to acquire them. Thus, on
                    29 August 2007, the Appellant’s solicitors wrote to the
                    Respondent’s solicitors explaining the problem. Paragraph 5 of their
                    letter requested, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Respondent grant an extension of time for completion of the sale
                        and purchase until the Appellant’s application for strata subdivision
                        was completed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     that a fresh option to purchase be granted reflecting that the Appellant
                        would be purchasing the Properties as ten separate units instead of one
                        single unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Respondent’s solicitors replied on 13 September 2007 as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our clients were not aware that your clients were not qualified to
                        purchase the above properties. In any event, the onus is on your clients to
                        ensure that they are permitted under the Residential Properties Act to
                        purchase the above properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As stated in your said letter, the sale and purchase cannot be completed.
                        Our clients are therefore entitled to retain the deposit paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your clients’ proposal as contained in paragraph 5 of your said
                        letter is not acceptable to our clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant, through its in-house counsel, wrote to the Respondent on
                    25 September 2007 requesting it to meet up and discuss the matter directly
                    instead of corresponding through their solicitors. Unfortunately, this letter
                    went unheeded. The Respondent then applied to court in Originating Summons
                    No 1840 of 2007 (“OS 1840/2007”) for the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Option be declared void under s 3 of the RPA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the Appellant withdraw its caveat lodged against the
                        Properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     OS 1840/2007 was heard on 22 January 2008 with the Appellant not
                    appearing. The judge hearing the application made the orders sought. The
                    Appellant then commenced the present proceedings for the return of the deposit
                    and the Option fee. In its pleadings, the Appellant alleged that Poh had
                    misrepresented to Ma during the viewing of the Properties that they were zoned
                    commercial. The Appellant contended in the alternative that it had paid the
                    deposit and Option fee under a mistake that the Properties were zoned commercial
                    and that the Respondent should not be unjustly enriched by keeping the
                    monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge dismissed the Appellant’s claim. He found on the evidence that
                    Poh had not represented to Ma that the Properties were zoned commercial. The
                    Judge also found that Ma knew, at the time the Appellant exercised the option,
                    that the Properties were partially zoned residential. This second finding was an
                    inference drawn from the primary facts and the Judge relied on the following
                    factors to justify his finding:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ma lived in a shophouse similar to the Properties in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ma was accompanied by Tan who had been in the property business since 1999
                        and who was his property agent for six years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Ma had taken photographs of the Properties during the viewing on
                        16 June 2007 which obviously showed that the upper floors were being
                        used for residential purposes. Neary also testified in cross-examination
                        that the upper floor of the unit they inspected had a kitchen, bathrooms and
                        bedrooms and seemed to be residential.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The option was granted on 17 June 2007 and exercised on 9 July
                        2007, a time interval of approximately three weeks. The Judge did not
                        believe that Ma would have gotten the Appellant to pay a deposit of $308,800
                        without verifying that the Properties were indeed zoned commercial during
                        this time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Appellant had also contended that since the contract between the parties
                    had been declared void in any event, the Option fee and deposit had to be
                    returned as a natural consequence. The Judge rejected this argument and held
                    that since the contract was void for illegality, the Appellant had to show a
                    strong case that it would only be fair and just for it to recover its money. On
                    the facts, the Appellant had chosen to pay over the deposit without verification
                    or contractual protection. The Judge also referred to previous cases where a
                    purchaser who had parted with his money would not be able to recover it if the
                    contract was declared void under s 3 of the RPA. Finally, as regards the 1%
                    Option fee, the Judge held that it was the price paid for the Option which was
                    separate from the contract of sale. The Respondent was therefore entitled to
                    retain the Option fee in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellant argued on appeal that the Judge had erred in finding that
                    (1) there had been no misrepresentation by Poh; and (2) Ma had known
                    the Properties were zoned partly residential at the time the Appellant exercised
                    the Option. Although the Appellant accepted that the contract for sale of the
                    Properties was void for illegality under the RPA, it contended that it was
                    nonetheless entitled to restitution of the monies paid under the void contract
                    because it had not deliberately attempted to circumvent the RPA. As such, it was
                    not <em>in pari delicto</em> with the Respondent and/or
                    came within the doctrine of <em>locus poenitentiae</em>.
                    The Appellant also argued that it was entitled to restitution of the said monies
                    as it had operated under a mistake of fact. Finally, it submitted that the
                    Respondent had been guilty of unconscionable conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Respondent argued on the other hand that the Judge had been justified in
                    arriving at his findings. It also contended that a party to an illegal contract
                    could recover monies paid pursuant to that contract on the basis that the
                    parties were not <em>in pari delicto</em> only if the party
                    seeking restitution had been the victim of fraud, duress, oppression, or abuse
                    of fiduciary position by the other party. The Respondent submitted that the
                    doctrine of <em>locus poenitentiae</em> did not apply here
                    because the contract had already been sufficiently performed by the Appellant in
                    exercising the Option and paying the deposit. The Respondent also argued that
                    there had clearly been no mistake on the Appellant’s part to begin with.
                    Finally, it submitted that it had not been guilty of any unconscionable
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was there a misrepresentation by Poh?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We were of the view that the Judge’s finding that Poh had not made a
                    misrepresentation as to the zoning of the Properties should not be disturbed.
                    The thrust of the Appellant’s appeal on this issue was that three of its
                    witnesses (Ma, Tan and Neary) had testified at trial that they had heard Poh say
                    that the Properties were zoned commercial during the viewing on 16 June
                    2007. However, the Judge had already heard their evidence first-hand and had the
                    opportunity of assessing the relative credibility of all the witnesses. Having
                    done so, the Judge ultimately preferred the evidence of Poh, who said that she
                    had never made any such representation. As the Appellant has not shown any
                    indication that the Judge’s assessment was plainly wrong or against the
                    weight of the evidence, an appellate court would be slow to interfere with such
                    a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was Ma mistaken about the zoning of the Properties when the Appellant
                exercised the Option?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, we were less hesitant in reviewing the Judge’s inference that
                    Ma had known that the Properties were zoned residential when the Appellant
                    exercised the Option. As we observed in <em>Tat Seng Machine
                        Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R)
                    1101 (at [41]), where a finding of fact is based on an inference drawn from the
                    facts or the evaluation of primary facts instead of the assessment of the
                    witness, an appellate court is in as good a position as the Judge to undertake
                    that exercise. In our respectful view, the factors relied on by the Judge did
                    not really support an inference that Ma had known of the Properties being zoned
                    residential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     First, the Judge seemed to suggest that as Ma himself lived in a shophouse
                    which was zoned residential, he should have known that the Properties would
                    similarly be zoned residential. However, Ma had also testified in re-examination
                    that he had come across shophouses which were zoned purely commercial in his
                    business dealings. As such, there was no reason for Ma to have realised that the
                    Properties were partially zoned residential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Secondly, the Judge took into account the fact that Tan was an experienced
                    property agent and must have been aware from the photographs and inspection of
                    the Properties that they were not fully commercial. However, Tan’s
                    evidence exactly was that she had checked with Poh and had been told that the
                    Properties could be purchased by a foreigner. Although the Judge accepted
                    Poh’s evidence that she had not made any misrepresentation, he did not
                    make any finding that Tan had been lying and it was entirely possible that there
                    had simply been a misunderstanding during the viewing of the Properties on
                    16 June 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, the Judge considered that the photographs taken by and what he saw
                    during the actual viewing of the Properties should have alerted him to their
                    residential nature. As with Tan’s evidence above, Ma said in
                    cross-examination that he had doubts about the zoning, which was why he had
                    tried to clarify the matter with Poh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Finally, the Judge was of the view that Ma had a substantial amount of time,
                    in between the grant and the exercise of the Option, to verify that the
                    Properties were indeed fully zoned commercial. However, this really assumes that
                    Ma was still left in doubt about the zoning of the Properties after he had
                    viewed them. If he was genuinely convinced that the Properties were not zoned
                    residential, there would have been no impetus for him to verify this with
                    URA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Judge concluded (see the Judgment at [6]) that “I do not accept that the plaintiff would pay
                    $308,800 without verifying whether the shophouses were zoned commercial”.
                    However, this reasoning could also cut the other way. If Ma knew for a fact that
                    the Appellant was ineligible to purchase the Properties because they were
                    partially zoned residential, why would he even get the Appellant to exercise the
                    Option and pay a deposit of $308,800 without providing for any safeguards? It
                    made absolutely no sense for the Appellant to enter into a transaction which it
                    was prohibited by law from completing unless it had intended to deliberately
                    circumvent the provisions of the RPA. There was no suggestion that the Appellant
                    had such an intention in the present case. Thus, the only possible explanation
                    was that Ma had satisfied himself (wrongly, as it turned out to be) that the
                    Properties were zoned wholly commercial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Although the Respondent initially sought to uphold all the Judge’s
                    findings in its written submissions, its counsel, Ms Felicia Ng, conceded
                    at the hearing before us (correctly, in our view, based on the objective facts)
                    that Ma had probably been mistaken as to the zoning of the Properties when the
                    Option was exercised. Instead, counsel proceeded on the basis that the Appellant
                    was not entitled to restitution of the deposit and Option fee simply because the
                    contract of sale was illegal. The real issue, then, was whether a mistake
                    resulting in a party entering into an illegal transaction would nevertheless
                    entitle that party to restitution of monies paid under the transaction, and it
                    is to this particular issue that our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal effect of the mistake</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Ms Ng submitted, in oral argument before this court, that the mistake by
                    the Appellant was irrelevant in light of the fact that the contract was illegal.
                    However, as Prof R A Buckley points out in his leading treatise
                    on illegality and public policy (see R A Buckley, <em>Illegality and Public Policy</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2nd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Buckley</em>”) (at
                    para 17.08)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has long been clear that restitutionary relief may be available to a
                        party who has entered into an illegal transaction as a result of a mistake
                        as to the facts constituting the illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The above principle has, in fact, been endorsed in other well-established
                    works (and even law commission reports) (see, for example, Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of Contract</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Treitel</em>”) at para 11-135; Nelson Enonchong,
                        <em>Illegal Transactions</em> (LLP, 1998)
                        (“<em>Enonchong</em>”) at
                    pp 315–317; <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) vol 1
                        (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at
                    para 16-187; Lord Goff of Chieveley and Gareth Jones, <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    7th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Goff and
                    Jones</em>”) at para 24-013; Law Reform Committee of the
                    Singapore Academy of Law, <em>Relief from Unenforceability of
                        Illegal Contracts and Trusts</em> (5 July 2002) at para 6.0;
                    and Law Commission of England and Wales, <em>Illegal
                        Transactions: The Effect of Illegality on Contracts and Trusts – A
                        Consultation Paper</em> (Consultation Paper No 154, 1999) at
                    paras 2.38–2.39). Significantly, in our view, the Appellant did in
                    fact cite the passages from both <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> and <em>Goff and Jones</em> in its
                    written submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Although the principle could – depending on the precise facts –
                    come under the broader umbrella heading to the effect that the parties are not
                        <em>in pari delicto</em>, this need <em>not necessarily</em> be the case (as, for example, where both parties
                    were equally mistaken, which common mistake served to mask the illegality in
                    question in so far as they were concerned). Indeed, that is perhaps why many
                    writers discuss this principle under the rubric of “restitution”
                    (see, for example, <em>Treitel</em> at p 541 (which
                    section heading is entitled “Restitution”); <em>Buckley</em> at ch 17 (which chapter is entitled
                    “Illegality and Restitution”); <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> at p 1197 (which section heading is entitled
                    “Recovery of Money Paid or Property Transferred under Illegal
                    Contracts”); but <em>cf Enonchong</em> at ch 16
                    (which chapter is entitled “Claimant is Not In Pari Delicto”)). Be
                    that as it may, as observed in the preceding paragraphs, the principle itself
                    has been clearly established in the legal landscape.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Ms Ng relied on three High Court cases which were also cited by the Judge
                    in the court below. In <em>Cheng Mun Siah v Tan Nam
                        Sui</em> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 611 and <em>Lim Xue Shan v
                        Ong Kim Cheong</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 102, the purchasers who had
                    entered into contracts to purchase restricted property in contravention of
                    s 3 of the RPA were unable to recover their deposits from the vendors
                    because the parties were <em>in pari delicto</em>. The
                    third case, <em>Tan Cheow Gek v Gimly Holdings Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1992] 2 SLR(R) 240, was slightly different as the deposit monies were
                    being held by the vendors’ former solicitors as stakeholders, although
                    Judith Prakash JC observed, by way of <em>obiter
                        dicta</em> (at [32]), that if
                    the deposit had been paid directly to the vendors then the purchasers would be
                    unable to recover the same on the authority of the preceding two cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We are of the view that these cases did not assist the Respondent because they
                    were concerned with the parties being <em>in pari
                        delicto</em> and the issue of mistake was not raised in those cases.
                    As we explained above (at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>), the
                    principle of a party being able to recover monies paid under an illegal contract
                    on the ground of mistake did not necessarily come under the broader umbrella
                    principle to the effect that the parties are not <em>in pari
                        delicto</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It should be noted, however, that the relief accorded by the court in the
                    context of mistake is <em>only</em> by way of <em>restitution</em> – and no more. To allow the claimant
                    to obtain more than restitution would, <em>in substance and
                        effect</em>, be to allow it to <em>enforce</em>
                    the <em>illegal</em> contract – which would obviously
                    be a contradiction in terms (see also, for example, <em>Buckley</em> at para 17.02 and <em>Enonchong</em> at p 317).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Turning to the facts of the present appeal, it is clear that the effect of the
                    mistake would entitle the Appellant <em>only</em> to
                        <em>restitutionary</em> relief (which was precisely
                    what it was claiming), and the appeal succeeds as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Repentance or timely repudiation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to consider the issue of
                    repentance or timely repudiation (also encompassed within the pithy Latin phrase
                        “<em>locus poenitentiae</em>” (<em>viz</em>, a place for repentance)), which also constitutes a
                    route by which <em>restitution</em> can be made in the
                    context of an illegal contract. We pause to observe – parenthetically
                    – that, whilst the general thrust of this doctrine is easy to grasp, its
                    doctrinal formulation as well as practical application raise numerous
                    difficulties (see, for example, the oft-cited trilogy of articles
                    (J K Grodecki, “In Pari Delicto Potior Est Conditio
                    Defendentis” (1955) 71 LQR 254 (“<em>Grodecki</em>”); J Beatson, “Repudiation of
                    Illegal Purpose as a Ground for Restitution” (1975) 91 LQR 313
                        (“<em>Beatson</em>”); and Robert Merkin,
                    “Restitution by Withdrawal from Executory Illegal Contracts”
                    (1981) 97 LQR 420 (“<em>Merkin</em>”)
                    (reference may also be made to S U Ahmed, “Locus Poeitentiae
                    – Repentance by a Party to an Illegal Contract” (1982)
                        12 <em>U Queensland LJ</em> 120 and Francis
                    Rose, “Restitutionary and Proprietary Consequences of Illegality”
                    in F D Rose (Ed), <em>Consensus Ad Idem – Essays
                        in the Law of Contract in Honour of Guenter Treitel</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1996), ch 10 (“<em>Rose</em>”), especially at pp 226-234)) as well as the
                    relevant chapters in two specialist books on illegality and public policy (see
                        <em>Enonchong</em> at ch 19 and <em>Buckley</em> at ch 18)). One major controversy centres around
                    the ostensibly different approaches adopted in the two leading English decisions
                    of <em>Taylor v Bowers</em> (1876) 1 QBD 291
                        (“<em>Taylor</em>”) and <em>Kearley v Thomson</em> (1890) 24 QBD 742
                        (“<em>Kearley</em>”), the latter of which
                    appears to adopt a stricter approach towards recovery. It is clear, however,
                    from the leading judgment of Fry LJ in <em>Kearley</em> (at 746) that the very doctrine itself was not received
                    with any sort of legal warmth to begin with (but <em>cf</em> the observations in the Privy Council decision (on appeal
                    from the Chief Court of Lower Burma) of <em>Petherpermal Chetty v
                        Muniandy Servai and others</em> (1908) 26 TLR 462 at 463 (a
                    decision which has been correctly described as “not [seeming] to have
                    received the attention it deserves” (see <em>Grodecki</em> at p 263)). On the other hand, it has been
                    perceptively pointed out that <em>Taylor</em> involved an
                    arrangement that was not wholly executory but that the same result could
                    nevertheless have been achieved <em>via</em> yet another
                    legal route (<em>viz</em>, an independent cause of action)
                    (see, for example, <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> at
                    para 16-189; <em>Beatson</em> at p 314; and
                        <em>Goff and Jones</em> at para 24-007). Returning
                    to the apparent conflict between <em>Taylor</em> and
                        <em>Kearley</em>, it has been suggested (correctly, in
                    our view) that both decisions are in fact consistent with each other if it is
                    borne in mind that the focus ought to be on whether the illegal <em>purpose</em> – as opposed to the <em>performance –</em> of the contract had been substantially
                    achieved (see, for example, <em>Treitel</em> at
                    para 11-137; <em>Enonchong</em> at
                    pp 340–342; <em>Beatson</em> at p 313; and
                        <em>Rose</em> especially at p 229; though
                        <em>cf Merkin</em> at p 427), with the result that
                    any apparent conflict between these two decisions becomes one which can be
                    resolved based on the <em>different facts</em>, as opposed
                    to any difference in <em>legal</em> approach as such (see
                    also <em>Rose</em> at pp 230-231); and for later
                    decisions, see, for example, the English Court of Appeal decisions of <em>Tribe v Tribe</em> [1996] Ch 107 (“<em>Tribe</em>”) and <em>Collier v
                        Collier</em> [2002] BPIR 1057; as well as the English High Court
                    decision of <em>Q v Q</em> [2009] 1 FLR 935).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The other major controversy centres around the issue as to whether in order
                    for “repentance” to be successful, it must be both <em>genuine and voluntary</em>, with the result that, where the
                    contracting party concerned had no choice but to repent because the fulfilment
                    of the illegal purpose was no longer possible owing to external circumstances
                    beyond the control of the parties, the doctrine will not apply (see the leading
                    English decision of <em>Bigos v Boustead</em> [1951]
                    1 All ER 92 (“<em>Bigos</em>”)).
                        <em>However</em>, in the more recent English Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Tribe</em>, only voluntariness
                    – as opposed to the genuineness – of repentance was emphasised (for
                    a comprehensive discussion of the arguments for as well as against such an
                    approach, see <em>Enonchong</em> at pp 337–338).
                    There may well be an overlap between – or even coincidence of –
                    these two elements, depending on the fact situation concerned. Indeed, if the
                    relevant legal proposition is that the concept of genuineness is unnecessary in
                    so far as it connotes a <em>subjective</em> feeling of
                        <em>remorse</em> on the part of the party concerned
                    (and <em>cf Goff and Jones</em> at para 24-008), there
                    may well be no practical difficulties inasmuch as the concept of voluntariness
                    means that, on the facts of cases such as <em>Bigos</em>,
                    the result would be the same (see <em>Enonchong</em> at
                    p 339; but <em>cf per</em> Millett LJ in
                        <em>Tribe</em> at 135).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, as already noted above (at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>),
                    it is unnecessary to consider the application of the doctrine of repentance or
                    timely repudiation in the context of the present appeal, and there is therefore
                    no need for us to deliver definitive pronouncements on the various conceptual as
                    well as practical difficulties arising from this doctrine (including the two
                    major controversies noted briefly above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Refund of the Option fee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Since the Appellant had exercised the Option and paid the deposit under a
                    mistake as to the zoning of the Properties, it was entitled to restitution of
                    the deposit notwithstanding the fact that the contract for sale of the
                    Properties was illegal. The question then was whether the Option fee should also
                    be refunded along with the deposit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In this regard, the Judge rightly recognised that there were two contracts
                    here: the first being the contract for sale of the Option (for which the
                    Appellant paid a fee of $77,200), and the second being the contract for sale of
                    the Properties (which arose when the Option was exercised and for which the
                    Appellant paid the deposit of $308,800). If it were the case that only the
                    latter contract was void under s 3 of the RPA, the Respondent would still
                    be able to retain the Option fee of $77,200 since it had provided good
                    consideration (<em>viz</em>, the Option) for the
                    fee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, the Respondent had obtained a court order in OS 1840/2007
                    declaring the entire Option void, and not just the actual contract for sale of
                    the Properties that arose when the Option was exercised. Since the Option itself
                    had been declared void, there was a total failure of consideration with respect
                    to the $77,200 Option fee and the Appellant was therefore also entitled to
                    restitution of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the reasons set out above, we allowed the appeal with costs and the usual
                    consequential orders, and ordered the Respondent to refund both the deposit and
                    Option fee (amounting to a total of $386,000) to the Appellant with interest at
                    4% from the date of the writ.</p>
