<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff in this Originating Summons, World
                    Sport Group Pte Ltd, initiated these proceedings under O 24 r 6(1) and O 26A r
                    1(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Rules”) in order to obtain pre-action discovery from, and administer
                    pre-action interrogatories against, the defendant, James Michael Dorsey. The
                    interrogatories sought to be administered were set out in Schedule 1 annexed to
                    the Originating Summons. A copy of Schedule 1 is annexed to these grounds of
                    decision.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The application first came on for hearing before
                    an assistant registrar (“AR”) and she ordered the defendant to
                    answer all the interrogatories set out in Schedule 1. She refused, however, to
                    order discovery of the documents specified in Schedule 2 (which was also annexed
                    to the Originating Summons). The defendant appealed. There was, however, no
                    cross-appeal by the plaintiff on the issue of discovery. On hearing the appeal,
                    I decided that the defendant had to answer the following interrogatories,
                        <em>viz</em>, nos 1, 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 6 and 6.1. I
                    allowed the defendant’s appeal in respect of the other interrogatories
                    being nos 2(d), 2(e), 3.1, 3.2, 4, 5, 6.2 and 6.3. The defendant is not
                    satisfied with this outcome and has appealed to the Court of
                Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is a company which was
                    incorporated in Singapore in 2002. It provides sports marketing and media and
                    event management in connection with international sporting events throughout
                    Asia. The plaintiff and its related entities have been in a contractual
                    relationship with the Asian Football Confederation (“AFC”) since
                    1993 with respect to the commercial rights of major football competitions staged
                    by the AFC. The AFC is the organiser, controller and official governing body of
                    the sport of association football throughout Asia (including
                Australia).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant is a Senior Fellow at the Nanyang
                    Technological University’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies
                    (“NTU”). He has a keen interest in issues affecting the Middle
                    East and North Africa including politics and the interaction of sports with
                    politics, economics and culture. In addition, he is a blogger on his blog
                    http://mideastsoccer.blogspot.sg/. He also has a Twitter account which he uses
                    to tweet his posts and articles. The defendant writes articles on, <em>inter alia</em>, the political, social and economic
                    development of soccer in the Middle East on his blog and in a multitude of other
                    media, which he tweets through his Twitter account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The AFC has been in contractual relationships
                    with the plaintiff and its related entities since 1993. On 15 June 2009, the AFC
                    and an associate of the plaintiff entered into a Master Rights Agreement
                    (“the MRA”) for the exploitation of commercial rights to AFC
                    football competitions taking place between 2013 and 2020. The MRA was novated to
                    the plaintiff with effect from 1 January 2010. According to the plaintiff, the
                    MRA contains a strict confidentiality clause which prevents the plaintiff from
                    disclosing its contents unless required by law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In July 2011, Mohamed Bin Hammam
                    (“MBH”), the then president of AFC, was banned from the
                    International Federation of Association Football (“FIFA”) as a
                    result of allegations of election bribery made against him. Subsequently, the
                    Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned this ban but FIFA then banned him
                    again pending concerns regarding his management of AFC’s funds as well as
                    pending a renewed investigation into the election bribery charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On or about 13 July 2012, PriceWaterhouseCoopers
                    Advisory Service Sdn Bhd (“PWC”), under the instructions of AFC
                    and its Malaysian solicitors, put up an audit report (“the
                    Report”) reviewing transactions, accounting practices and contracts
                    negotiated during MBH’s tenure as president of the AFC. The Report
                    contains a number of references to the MRA and its commercial terms. According
                    to the plaintiff, the Report states that it is intended solely for the
                    “internal use and benefit” of AFC and its Malaysian solicitors and
                    is therefore confidential. The plaintiff also alleges that remarks defamatory of
                    it are contained in the Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Between 23 July 2012 and 22 September 2012, the
                    defendant published several posts and articles on the world wide web. These
                    included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     on 23 July 2012, an article entitled

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a>(e)     on 28 August 2012 an article entitled

                            the hot seat</em>”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a>(f)     on 5 September 2012, a post entitled “<em>AFC reports stolen Bin Hammam payment documents to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a>(g)     on 12 September 2012, a post entitled
                            “<em>World Sport Group sues journalist in bid to
                            squash reporting on Bin Hammam</em>” on his blog;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_h"></a>(h)     on 22
                        September 2012, a post entitled “<em>Iran accused WSG
                            of overpricing in breach of international rules</em>” on
                        his blog.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In his article posted on his blog on 23 July
                    2012, the defendant referred to and quoted from the Report. The quoted parts
                    included portions of the Report which the plaintiff says are defamatory of it.
                    In this article, the defendant admitted that he had obtained a copy of the
                    Report. Subsequently, in or about August 2012, media organisations in Australia,
                    Saudi Arabia and northern California published articles which made reference to
                    the Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff commenced the present
                    proceedings to obtain discovery of the Report and for leave to serve pre-action
                    interrogatories pursuant to O 26A r 1 of the Rules (“O 26A r
                    1”) on the defendant to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     identify the party or parties
                        responsible for publishing the Report or its contents to third parties;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     identify
                        the party or parties who provided confidential information to the defendant
                        pertaining to the MRA and to ascertain the nature of any breach of an
                        obligation of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff’s intention is to commence
                    proceedings against the defendant and/or:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     any party whom the answers to the
                        interrogatories show had provided a copy of the Report to any third party in
                        breach of confidentiality and/or had published material defamatory of the
                        plaintiff contained in the Report to any party by providing a copy of the
                        whole or any part of the Report to any person; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     any party whom the answers to the
                        interrogatories show had provided confidential information to the defendant
                        relating to the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff’s position is that the
                    Report was prepared without its representatives having been consulted or
                    interviewed and that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Report contains assertions and
                        imputations that are <em>prima facie</em>
                        defamatory;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     PWC
                        was provided with inaccurate or incomplete information and materials which
                        were insufficient for PWC to prepare a report containing an accurate picture
                        of what actually transpired; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Report makes conclusions that are
                    speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant alleges that the Report is not
                    confidential. He does not dispute that the Report contains defamatory
                    allegations and/or conveys innuendos of the plaintiff that are defamatory. His
                    position is that the plaintiff ought to direct its intended cause of action
                    against the AFC for “disseminating the Report which allegedly contained
                    defamatory remarks about the Plaintiff”. The AFC has, however, according
                    to the plaintiff, denied that it disclosed the Report to anyone but FIFA. The
                    AFC has also stated that the distribution of the Report is unauthorised and that
                    those who have received it must destroy it. The plaintiff admits that it does
                    not have any evidence that links the circulation of the Report with the AFC
                    and/or its employees/officers/representatives.</p>

                    2009</em>”), it is noted at para 26A/1/5 that O 26A r 1(5)
                    formulates the principle enunciated in <em>Norwich Pharmacal Co v
                        Customs and Excise Commissioners</em> [1974] AC 133 (“<em>Norwich Pharmacal</em>”). The principle laid down in
                        <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em> is that a claimant may seek
                    information for the purpose of identifying the person who is potentially liable
                    to him. The wording of O 26A r 1(5) is broader than this original principle in
                    that the court is given the power to administer interrogatories with a view to
                    identifying “possible parties” to any proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The rationale of the <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em> principle as explained by Lord Reid at p 174
                    was that if information in the possession of the defendant as to the identity of
                    tortfeasors could not be made available by discovery, the applicant would not be
                    able to begin any action against possible parties because he would not know the
                    identity of the persons who had committed tortious wrongdoings against
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The scope of the <em>Norwich
                        Pharmacal</em> principle was examined further in <em>British Steel Corp v Granada Television Ltd</em> [1980] 3 WLR 774
                        (“<em>British Steel</em>”). There, the
                    applicant, British Steel, commenced an action against a television company for
                    disclosure of the name of one of the applicant’s employees who had
                    wrongfully passed confidential information to the television company. The High
                    Court granted the order and this was upheld on appeal. Lord Wilberforce stated
                    at p 826 of his opinion in the House of Lords that for an aggrieved person to
                    succeed in obtaining such an order against a journalist, he would have
                    “to satisfy the court that he has a real grievance, even after suing the
                    newspaper, which, in the interest of justice, he ought to be allowed to pursue,
                    and that this ought, in the particular case, to outweigh whatever public
                    interest there may be in preserving the confidence”. Lord Wilberforce
                    further noted at p 827 that there was a public interest in the free flow of
                    information but that the strength of such interest would vary from case to case
                    and the court ought to take this into account. In the <em>British
                        Steel</em> case, however, the balance was strongly in British
                    Steel’s favour because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[British Steel] suffered a grievous wrong, in which Granada itself became
                        involved, not innocently, but with active participation. To confine [British
                        Steel] to its remedy against Granada and to deny it the opportunity of a
                        remedy against the source, would be a significant denial of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There is substantial case authority in
                    Singapore on this issue. Singapore courts have not only applied the <em>Norwich Pharmacal</em> principle but have also considered O
                    26A r 2 and emphasised that if the interrogatories are not relevant and
                    necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving
                    costs, they will not be allowed. For example, in <em>Richland
                        Logistics Services Pte Ltd v Biforst Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    SGHC 137, Lai Siu Chiu J observed at [38] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any event, whatever the outcome of the interrogatories, granting the
                        application would amount to a cost-savings measure. If the defendant’s
                        answers proved that the plaintiff’s suspicions were unfounded, time
                        and money would have been saved by the plaintiff not pursuing a claim
                        against AKTPL. On the other hand, if the plaintiff’s suspicions were
                        proved correct, it could take the appropriate action against AKTPL and/or
                        Ang and/or Koh. The defendant would not be prejudiced in any event as the
                        plaintiff would bear the defendant’s costs of answering the
                        interrogatories, pursuant to O 26A r 5 of the Rules. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is also relevant in this case to reiterate
                    that what has been called the “newspaper rule” in England does not
                    apply in Singapore. The newspaper rule as observed in England is that the courts
                    will not, as a rule, compel a newspaper in a libel action to disclose before
                    trial the source of its information. In <em>KLW Holdings Ltd v
                        Singapore Press Holdings Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 477, it was held
                    that there was no newspaper rule in Singapore. This decision was followed by
                        <em>Tullett Prebon (Singapore) Ltd and others v Spring Mark
                        Geoffrey and another</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 187. Instead, the courts
                    have, as demonstrated in the two cases cited, leaned in favour of a balancing of
                    interests approach in resolving cases that require a reporter/journalist to
                    disclose the identity of his source.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Bayerische Hypo- und
                        Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and other
                        applications</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J noted that
                    the court had a duty to ensure that any application for pre-action discovery was
                    not frivolous or speculative and that the applicant was not on a fishing
                    expedition. Once the court was satisfied that these criteria had been met, then
                    the next consideration would be whether the discovery would be necessary for
                    disposing fairly of the proceedings or for saving costs. As Choo Han Teck J
                    put it more colourfully in <em>Ng Giok Oh v Sajjad
                        Akhtar</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 375 at [7], pre-action discovery is not an
                    instrument for private detectives snooping for action. Whilst the cited cases
                    are on pre-action discovery, the principles they state are also relevant in
                    cases like the present on pre-action interrogatories. In this respect, it is
                    stated in <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> at para
                    26A/1/5 that the authorities applicable to pre-action discovery would similarly
                    apply to pre-action interrogatories.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The first two interrogatories that I ordered

<p class="Judg-1">These interrogatories were more
                    specifically directed towards ascertaining whether a copy of the MRA was given
                    to the defendant and if so by whom. Whilst my order referred specifically only
                    to interrogatory 6.1, this was an oversight as an answer to interrogatory 6 is
                    necessarily required before interrogatory 6.1 becomes answerable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It may be helpful for me to set out here the
                    portions of the defendant’s article which gave rise to the
                    plaintiff’s request for interrogatories. These read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The AFC has raised questions about the sincerity of its investigation by
                        hiring the group despite CAS’s rejection of its earlier work. The
                        group has been tasked with further investigating the findings of a report by
                        PriceWaterhouseCooper [<em>sic</em>] (PwC) that charged
                        Mr. Bin Hammam had used an AFC sundry account as his personal account and
                        raised questions about his negotiation of a $1 billion marketing and rights
                        contract with Singapore-based World Sport Group (WSG) ... The PwC report
                        further suggested that there may have been cases of AFC money laundering,
                        tax invasion [<em>sic</em>], bribery and busting of US
                        sanctions against Iran and North Korea under Mr. Bin Hammam’s
                        leadership.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The WSG master rights agreement (MRA) that <u>according
                            to sources close to the AFC</u> handed the soccer body’s
                        assets embodied in its rights to the company is certain to be at the core of
                        both investigations. <b><em>PwC questioned the fact that the
                            contract as well as the agreement with Al Jazeera had been awarded
                            without being putting [</em></b><b>sic</b><b><em>] out to tender or financial due
                            diligence. </em></b><u>Sources close to AFC said the
                            contract</u> awarded WSG all the benefits while ensuring that AFC
                        retained the potential liabilities. <b><em>PwC said the
                            contract failed to give AFC a right to audit WSG’s services or
                            costs. “In comparison with similar-type agreements for other
                            sports, it appears that the current MRA may be considerably
                            undervalued,” the PwC report said.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The report charged further that Mr. Bin Hammam had received in February
                        2008 $12 million from Al Baraka Investment and Development Co, believed to
                        be owned by Saudi billionaire Sheikh Saleh Kamel. <b><em>“We understand that the Al Baraka Group may have been a 20%

                            the AFC signed a $1 billion master rights agreement (MRA) in June 2009
                            negotiated by Mr. Bin Hammam,” the report said.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Sources close to the AFC</u> said the soccer
                        body had been advised to conclude a service provider rather than a master
                        rights agreement with WSG. This would have allowed the AFC to retain control
                        of its rights, determine how they are exploited and enabled it to
                        continuously supervise the quality of services provided by WSG. It would
                        have also guaranteed that the AFC rather than WSG would have been the
                        contracting party with broadcasters and sponsors and would have insulated
                        the soccer body from any risk should WSG ever default, <u>the sources said</u>. They said the contract was out of sync
                        with other international sports bodies that had shifted years ago from
                        rights to service provider agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>The sources said</u> the WSG agreement was
                        further detrimental to AFC’s interests because it failed to precisely
                        define what commercial rights were being granted. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>The sources said</u> the contract put WSG in
                        the driver’s seat with no oversight or transparency. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold italics and underline added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiff submitted that the portions of
                    the article which are underlined and emphasised in bold above, when read alone
                    and together, conveyed imputations defamatory of the plaintiff. These were that
                    the plaintiff secured the MRA at an undervaluation because of the absence of a
                    tender and/or by improper means and that as a result the MRA was seriously
                    disadvantageous to the AFC. Further, there was an innuendo that the plaintiff
                    was involved in corrupt practices, including paying bribes to MBH, to secure the
                    MRA. The plaintiff considered that the publication or dissemination of the
                    defamatory Report or the defamatory statements contained in the Report would
                    cause it damage and therefore it had a right to seek relief against the party
                    responsible whether the same was the defendant, the “sources close to the
                    AFC” or any other third party. It should be noted that the plaintiff
                    maintained that there was no truth in the derogatory statements and that the
                    Report had not considered other material favourable to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I agreed that the defendant’s article
                    contained statements that were, <em>prima facie</em>,
                    defamatory of the plaintiff and had identified these statements as emanating
                    either from the Report or from “sources close to the AFC” or from
                    “sources” who may or may not have been the same as those close to
                    the AFC. If in fact such sources had provided the Report or information about
                    the Report to the defendant, they would, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, have defamed the plaintiff or assisted in the publication
                    of defamatory statements. Thus, the plaintiff on the face of it had a cause of
                    action in defamation against such sources. The plaintiff had said in its
                    affidavits and submissions that it intended to commence legal proceedings
                    against such sources and needed to identify the same for this
                purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff also argued that because of the
                    presence of the confidentiality clause in the MRA, it had a possible cause of
                    action in breach of confidence against “sources close to the AFC”
                    who might have provided a copy of the MRA or information about it to the
                    defendant. I agreed that anybody who was employed by the AFC or had come to know
                    about the MRA by reason of a connection with the AFC could possibly be liable to
                    the plaintiff for breach of confidence if such person had released information
                    about the same to the defendant who was not entitled to be given such
                    information by virtue of the confidentiality clause in the MRA. In order to sue
                    such persons, the plaintiff would have to know their identities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I was satisfied that the plaintiff had not
                    made its application frivolously or vexatiously and that it had a valid reason
                    for administering pre-action interrogatories to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant argued that the plaintiff could
                    sue him and that should be a sufficient remedy. The plaintiff answered that it
                    had not yet commenced any proceedings against the defendant because it wanted to
                    know who the proper parties to sue were. The defendant was an individual and the
                    source might be an individual or might be someone that a company was responsible
                    for. Further, the defendant as an independent commentator might be able to put
                    up a defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest but such a defence
                    might not be available to the source. If the defendant was the only person sued
                    and he succeeded in this defence of fair comment, the plaintiff would then be
                    denied any remedy. It should be noted that the defendant had indicated in a
                    letter from his solicitors that even if the contents of his article were
                    defamatory of the plaintiff (which he denied), they were fair comments. In order
                    for the plaintiff to be afforded such protection as permitted under the law, it
                    needed to ascertain the identities of other persons potentially liable to it. I
                    agreed that the fact that the defendant might be liable for defamation was not a
                    sufficient reason to allow him to protect his sources since pursuing a legal
                    action against the defendant alone might not be effective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The MRA itself was a confidential document. On
                    this basis, the defendant who was not a party to it was not entitled to
                    information about it. Therefore, whoever informed the defendant about the MRA
                    was, possibly, a wrongdoer and the plaintiff was entitled to investigate and
                    initiate action to determine whether it had a legal remedy for breach of
                    confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff was at this stage unaware of who
                    had given the defendant information about the MRA apart from what was stated in
                    the Report. Such a person might have been authorised by the AFC to distribute
                    the MRA, he might be a person connected with the AFC who was acting without
                    authority, or he might be a person who had no connection at all with the AFC but
                    who had somehow managed to get a copy of the MRA. In this regard, the plaintiff
                    was entitled to know what connection this person had with the AFC since such
                    connection would determine whether and, if so, the extent to which the
                    confidentiality of MRA had been breached by the AFC or a person connected to it.
                    Question 2 of the interrogatories was designed to elicit this information and I
                    allowed it for this reason. The answer would inform the plaintiff about the
                    relationship between the AFC and the source who had given information about the
                    MRA to the defendant and would allow the plaintiff to properly calibrate its
                    future course of action. I allowed interrogatories 6 and 6.1 for the same
                    reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant argued that he was entitled to
                    protect his sources as a journalist. He produced a copy of the Code of
                    Professional Conduct of the Singapore National Union of Journalists. However,
                    the defendant did not state in his affidavit that he was a member of the
                    Singapore National Union of Journalists or that he considered himself to be
                    bound by that Code of Professional Conduct. I accepted the plaintiff’s
                    submission that, <em>prima facie</em>, the defendant was
                    not a journalist as he was employed by NTU as a Senior Fellow and kept up his
                    blog and his Twitter posts for his own interests and to disseminate his own
                    viewpoints. The defendant himself in one of his affidavits had said that prior
                    to joining NTU he had been a journalist and that from 2006 until the date of the
                    affidavit, he was also a freelance writer and speaker. In any event, as I have
                    stated earlier, there is no newspaper rule in Singapore that operates to protect
                    a journalist’s sources from being disclosed. Instead, the court adopts a
                    balancing of interests approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The court orders a party to disclose his
                    source of information if the plaintiff shows that it has a real interest in
                    suing the source and this outweighs the public interest of preserving the
                    confidence of sources. In this case, the plaintiff did establish its real
                    interest in suing the defendant’s source(s). As for the public interest,
                    whilst the public has an interest in the free flow of information, such interest
                    has to be balanced, <em>inter alia</em>, against the need
                    to preserve confidentiality and to encourage persons bound by obligations of
                    confidentiality to abide by the same. The “sources close to the
                    AFC” had <em>prima facie</em> breached their duties
                    of confidentiality under the MRA or in equity (by virtue of having knowledge of
                    the confidentiality of the MRA) and <em>prima facie</em> it
                    would not be correct to protect such breaches. Of course, once the identity of
                    the source is known, the source will be able to defend his/its actions in
                    accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>British
                    Steel</em>, Templeman LJ (as he then was) recognised at p 812 that
                    “[n]o principle of public policy or freedom of the press or freedom of
                    information or journalistic ethics justifies resistance in these circumstances
                    to [British Steel’s] claim to discover from Granada the identity of
                    [British Steel’s] employees who broke his promise to [British Steel],
                    enabled Granada to breach their duty to [British Steel] and now shelters behind
                    Granada’s promise of concealment”. This <em>dictum</em> aptly reflected the situation before me. I was satisfied
                    that the public interest in the free flow of information would not be adversely
                    affected by the orders that I made against the defendant in the light of the
                        <em>prima facie</em> probability that his sources were
                    in breach of their legal obligations of confidentiality by furnishing him with
                    information on, or a copy of, the MRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     One final point. During the hearing I pointed
                    out to the plaintiff that it was possible that it had no cause of action in
                    Singapore against anyone other than the defendant. This was because the AFC is a
                    Malaysian company and therefore “sources close to the AFC” were
                    probably in Malaysia as well. The plaintiff persuaded me that that was
                    speculation. The defendant had not indicated where he received his information
                    and in what manner. In the present age of easy movement of persons between
                    nations and the easier transmission of information across borders, the
                    information was as likely to have been received in Singapore as anywhere
                    else.</p>
