He is appealing against his conviction on the basis that he did not know that the black bundles found in his possession contained drugs. He submits that based on the evidence before the court, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA should be held to have been rebutted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This court has, on numerous occasions, expounded on the burden and standard of proof imposed on an accused person seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The burden of proving a lack of knowledge is undoubtedly for the accused person to discharge, and there are good reasons for having this exceptional evidential rule as part of our criminal law. But, the inherent difficulties of proving a negative (in the present context, a lack of knowledge) must be borne in mind (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Sibeko Lindiwe Mary-Jane</span> [2016] SGHC 199 at [61]), and the burden on an accused person faced with this task should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge. How this burden may be discharged is certainly not a matter that can be spelt out in a fixed formula. It is the overall picture that emerges to the court which is decisive as the court is here concerned not with a scientific matter, but with the state of a person’s mind. A factor which is considered to be critical in one case may not be so in another.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Appellant was, at the material time, a 20-year-old Malaysian residing in Johor Bahru and working in Singapore as a prime mover driver at the premises of the Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”).

In this regard, it is well established that to rebut this presumption of knowledge, the Appellant “bears the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug that was found” (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K </span><span class="font-italic">Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”) at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In this regard, a mere assertion of a lack of knowledge in circumstances where the accused was wilfully blind will be insufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge. In <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters</span> [2014] 3 SLR 721, this court explained at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Wilful blindness refers to a person <span class="font-italic">deliberately refusing</span> to inquire into facts and from which an inference of knowledge may be sustained … Put simply, wilful blindness is the <span class="font-italic">legal equivalent</span> of actual knowledge. Wilful blindness, however, is <span class="font-italic">not</span> negligence or an inadvertent failure to make inquiries. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span> the court held that the appellant concerned had been wilfully blind in refusing to take reasonable steps to find out what he was asked to deliver (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by opening the package) despite suspecting that it contained something illegal.

Since his house was on the way, I agreed to … That day, after I dropped “Mogan” at his house, he asked me for my handphone number and I gave it to him. I asked “Mogan” why he wanted my number and he told me that he wanted to call me and ask [me] to fetch him to work. … I only started to fetch “Mogan” from his place to go to work at PSA Singapore, about 4 to 5 days later from the said evening, sometime during the second week that we met. “Mogan” had called me on my handphone … and asked if I could fetch him from his house to go to work and I agreed. … “Mogan” would call me almost everyday at about 5pm to 5.30pm to ask me to pick him up. … “Mogan” did not mention how long he would be taking a ride with me. He just told me to try to bring him to work and send him home every day.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Pausing here, we observe that the Prosecution has not raised any evidence to cast doubt on the Appellant’s account of how he met Mogan. The Prosecution would have had information about Mogan, and if he were, for example, not working with the Appellant at PSA as colleagues as the Appellant claimed, this would certainly have come up in the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Additionally, it may be said from the short account at [20] above that the Appellant comes across as a rather simple, quiet and helpful character who, in the short two to three weeks that he knew Mogan, was quite willing to be at the latter’s beck and call. In the same vein, it should also be borne in mind that the Appellant was, at the time of the offence, only 20 years old and still living with his father in Johor Bahru. Seen in this light, and taking into account the fact that the Appellant and Mogan were working at the same place, it is not that surprising that the Appellant would have unquestioningly agreed to do Mogan the “favour” which Mogan asked of him even though he had only known Mogan for three weeks at that time. <span class="font-italic">Unless</span> the Appellant did in fact suspect that there was something illegal in the “jaman” which he was to bring to Singapore for Mogan, he (and indeed, any reasonable person) was likely to have viewed the “favour” which he was to do for Mogan as a simple innocuous one, and we would not have faulted him for so thinking. We now turn to consider the Appellant’s evidence on how he came to do Mogan the “favour”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “favour” on 12 June 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Appellant’s account of the events leading up to his agreement to help Mogan deliver the “jaman” to Mogan’s friend in Singapore is consistent across the eight statements which he gave to the CNB.

I was resting at home then. At about 5.30pm, “Mogan” called me on my handphone “HS-HP3” and asked me when I was starting work. I told him that I would start work at 10.30pm. “Mogan” then told me that he was giving me ‘jaman’ (Recorder’s notes: ‘jaman’ is Tamil word for ‘things’) and asked me if I could give the ‘jaman’ to his friend in Singapore. I told him ‘ok’ and that on my way to work, I would go to his place to get the ‘jaman’ from him. This was the first time that “Mogan” had asked me to give ‘jaman’ to his friend in Singapore. I reached his place at about 7.30pm to 7.45pm. I called “Mogan” and told him that I was at his place. “Mogan” then came down from his place. He was carrying a black plastic bag and told me that the ‘jaman’ were inside. Morgan passed me the black plastic bag and told me that after I reached Singapore, he would call me and tell me whom to pass the ‘jaman’ to.

I did not ask him what the “jaman” were. I did not ask why his friend wanted the ‘jaman’ for as well. I also did not ask “Mogan” why he did not bring the ‘jaman’ into Singapore himself as I knew that he had lost his passport about 3 days ago, sometime on 9 June 2013. I knew this as I overheard a group of workers talking about this during one of the lorry trips [from PSA’s gate to the area where the prime movers were parked]. … I did not ask “Mogan” any questions about the ‘jaman’ as I thought that since “Mogan” had asked me for help, I just thought I would do him a favour and helped [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] him since he was my friend. I did not think that there was anything wrong. I did not suspect anything also. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After I took the black plastic bag from “Mogan”, the black plastic bag felt heavy to me while I was holding it. I did not ask “Mogan” why the plastic bag was so heavy either. After he passed me the plastic bag, I then asked “Mogan” how I was supposed to contact his friend. “Mogan” then gave me his phone, a Singapore phone, “HS-HP1” … Mogan had told me that this phone had a Singapore number. “Mogan” told me that he would call me on the said phone “HS-HP1” when I reached Singapore, to tell me more about how to pass the ‘jaman’ to his friend. I was to call “Mogan” on the said Nokia phone “HS-HP1” to let him know that I had reached Singapore. After that, “Mogan” and I parted.

Here, we note an apparent inconsistency in the Appellant’s evidence. In his 16 June 2013 statement, the Appellant said that he transferred the Bundles to the Haversack “so that it would be easier for [him] to carry around”.

There is therefore no explanation before the court for this inconsistency. This was also not made the subject of the closing submissions in the court below, nor was it a factor that weighed on the Judge’s mind (based on the transcript of his oral grounds). On the whole, we find this to be a minor point that has little bearing on the main issue, which is whether the Appellant had knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. We would add that it is possible that the truth lies somewhere in between – it may be that the Appellant initially said that he did not want a drink, but, as he testified on the witness stand, he subsequently took one because Sulaimi told him to:

</div> The Prosecution submits that this could not be true. In this regard, we take judicial notice of the fact that there are clear warning notices about Singapore’s harsh drug laws both at the Singapore Customs and on the Disembarkation/Embarkation Cards that foreigners have to fill in before entering Singapore. Since, at the date of his arrest, the Appellant had already worked in Singapore for some three years and would have passed through the Singapore Customs countless times, we find that he would, at some point before his arrest, have come to know about Singapore’s strict drug laws. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The fact that the Appellant denied knowing about Singapore’s harsh drug laws even though he most likely did know about them does undermine his credibility to an extent. We struggle to understand why the Appellant denied having such knowledge, given that his denial did not advance his defence in the least. On the contrary, admitting to such knowledge would have helped in his defence. One possibility could be that the Appellant was simply afraid upon learning, after his arrest, that the Bundles contained drugs, and sought to distance himself from any association whatsoever with drugs. We do not, however, want to speculate on this issue. In any case, even if the Appellant did indeed lie about his lack of knowledge of Singapore’s drug laws, we do not think this single fact should be determinative – in the present context, this could be regarded as a peripheral fact which has little bearing on whether the Appellant knew or ought to have suspected that the Bundles contained drugs. Indeed, if the Appellant knew that Singapore had harsh drug laws and that the Bundles contained controlled drugs, it would be less likely that he would have agreed to do Mogan the “favour” without any reward in return (a point which will be discussed subsequently) and that he would have proceeded through the Singapore Customs so casually. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The alleged suspicious circumstances </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 We next consider the alleged suspicious circumstances which, the Prosecution argues, should have alerted the Appellant to the illegal nature of the contents of the Bundles. These include: (a) the weight, shape and appearance of the Bundles; (b) the extra mobile phone HS-HP1 that Mogan gave the Appellant; and (c) the lack of details regarding the delivery of the Bundles to Mogan’s friend in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The weight, shape and appearance of the Bundles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Prosecution argues that the manner in which the Bundles were packed and their weight should have raised alarm bells.

</div> While the practice of wrapping presents to be sent by post in black tape is not something which we are familiar with in Singapore, there is no independent evidence to corroborate or refute the Appellant’s explanation that such a practice exists in Malaysia. Furthermore, we do not find his explanation completely fanciful or implausible. In the circumstances, we have no basis to reject the Appellant’s explanation, which, we would add, was given at the earliest opportunity he had, namely, when he was narrating his account of what happened in the investigative statement recorded at 9.40am on 16 June 2013, four days after his arrest (see [28(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Prosecution further argues that even accepting the Appellant’s explanation, there were no postage marks on the Bundles, which should have raised questions in the Appellant’s mind.

</div>
</div> In our view, it is not unreasonable for the Appellant to have given little thought to the matter since the Bundles were not intended to be conveyed by post. The relevant point is that bundles wrapped in black tape were <span class="font-italic">not an unfamiliar sight</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> to the Appellant </span>because, according to him, in Malaysia, presents to be sent by post were sometimes wrapped in that way. He therefore may not have found it odd or suspicious when he saw that Mogan had done the same for the “jaman” which Mogan asked him to bring to Singapore. As we remarked to counsel during oral arguments, we cannot assume that the Appellant was acquainted with the way in which drugs intended for trafficking are normally wrapped or knew that “jaman” was a known reference to drugs in Tamil.

</div>
</div>
</div> The average person with no previous acquaintance with drugs and/or the practices of the drug trade is unlikely to know how drugs meant for trafficking are normally packed or referred to. Indeed, if the Appellant had known that “jaman” was a common term used to refer to drugs in Tamil, it is unlikely that he would have referred to the Bundles as “jaman”, given his consistent defence that he did not know they contained drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, the Appellant never really looked at the Bundles while he was at Mogan’s house. Indeed, it would have been dark at about 7.30pm when the Appellant reached Mogan’s house and received the black plastic bag. It was only at the petrol kiosk that the Appellant looked at the Bundles. By then, Mogan was no longer with him. While the Appellant could always have called Mogan to ask what was inside the Bundles, the Bundles obviously did not appear to the Appellant to be sufficiently suspicious (or suspicious <span class="font-italic">at all</span>) to justify his calling Mogan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the circumstances, we are satisfied by the Appellant’s explanation as to what he thought the Bundles were. On its own, the fact that the Bundles were heavy and wrapped in black tape need not have raised the suspicion of the Appellant or, for that matter, a reasonable person not acquainted with the ways of the drug trade. To be fair to an accused like the Appellant, it is important that the court does not readily assume that an ordinary reasonable person would be familiar with the practices of the drug trade.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The extra mobile phone HS-HP1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In relation to the mobile phone HS-HP1 which Mogan passed to the Appellant for the purpose of carrying out the “favour”, it may be argued that the Appellant should have been put on notice when Mogan handed him that mobile phone as Mogan could simply have given him some money instead to cover the costs of the telephone call(s) which he would have to make. This is especially so as the Appellant already had two mobile phones at that time, including a mobile phone containing a Singapore number. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On the witness stand, the Appellant explained in more detail why Mogan had given him the mobile phone HS-HP1, as opposed to, potentially, simply compensating him for the costs of the telephone call(s) that he would have to make in the course of carrying out the “favour”:

To the Appellant, and indeed, any reasonable person, keeping in mind that the Appellant was then on his way to work, the fact that Mogan passed him a mobile phone for the purpose of carrying out the “favour” might have seemed to be a simple matter of convenience. There was therefore nothing <span class="font-italic">per se</span> suspicious in that arrangement. We do not see the mere loan of the mobile phone HS-HP1 by Mogan to the Appellant as an indication that Mogan was up to something dubious or illegal, and that the Appellant should therefore have known about the contents of the Bundles. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the Appellant would be travelling back to Johor Bahru after finishing work and could thus return the aforesaid mobile phone to Mogan. As we stated earlier, there was a perfectly good explanation for the arrangement from<span class="font-italic"> the </span><span class="font-italic">Appellant’s </span>point of view.

Further, given that the Appellant did not expect to be acquainted with Mogan’s friend, it is not surprising that he did not bother to ask Mogan the exact identity of that friend. Finally, while the Prosecution submits that the Appellant risked being late for work by carrying out the “favour” for Mogan before going to work, nothing in the evidence suggests that this was the case. It appears that on 12 June 2013, the Appellant entered Singapore early enough to have sufficient time to carry out the “favour”. The Appellant only needed to be at work by 10.30pm,

If the Appellant had not been arrested and had completed the “favour”, it is likely that he would still have been able to make it for work in good time. We emphasise again that all these factors must be viewed in the light of the fact that the “favour” which Mogan asked the Appellant to carry out was, from the Appellant’s viewpoint, the request of a friend and colleague (albeit one whom the Appellant had known for only three weeks), as opposed to someone who was a known criminal or had a reputation for dealing in illegal substances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The DNA evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We now move on to the area of evidence relating to the Appellant’s DNA.

It is unclear to us whether the term “major component” in the context of DNA analysis bears a more specialised scientific meaning. Therefore, on the face of the DNA report, it is not clear whether the Appellant’s DNA was found all over the adhesive side of the tape used to wrap A2 or only at an edge of the adhesive side. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Assuming that the Appellant’s DNA was found only at the edge(s) of the adhesive side of the tape wrapped around A2, the DNA could very well have been transferred through the Appellant’s contact with A2 while he was transferring A2 (along with the rest of the Bundles) to the Haversack <span class="font-italic">if </span>the ends of the tape had stuck out slightly.

</div> The same cannot be observed in respect of A2, but a full picture of the Bundles is not before the court (the bottom and the sides of A2 cannot be seen in the picture of the Bundles adduced in evidence) and therefore, it cannot be definitively ascertained whether this was similarly the case with the tape used to wrap A2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We also observe that no <span class="font-italic">plausible</span> <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> <span class="font-italic">theories</span> explaining how the Appellant’s DNA evidence came to be found on the adhesive side of the tape wrapped around A2 have been presented by the Prosecution. Two factors stand out in this regard. First, the evidence does not support the inference that the Appellant helped to <span class="font-italic">pack</span> the Bundles (which, in any event, is not the Prosecution’s case given that it issued the Appellant a certificate of substantive assistance as a courier), especially since the Appellant’s DNA was not found on the adhesive side of the tape used to wrap A1 and A3. If the Appellant had indeed been involved in packing the Bundles, it would be odd that he helped only with the packing of A2, but not A1 and A3. Second, there is insufficient evidence to warrant drawing the inference that the Appellant had <span class="font-italic">un</span><span class="font-italic">fastened</span> the tape around A2 to see what was inside that bundle. Based on the photographic exhibits in evidence, it does not look like A2 had been unwrapped or otherwise interfered with and then wrapped up again (although, of course, as we have noted, the photographic evidence does not show the bottom and the sides of A2). Without a<span class="font-italic"> </span>plausible case theory explaining why the Appellant’s DNA came to be found on the adhesive side of the tape used to wrap A2, the DNA evidence, although suggestive of the Appellant’s knowledge of the contents of A2, cannot be treated either as evidence that the Appellant did indeed have such knowledge or as evidence which confirms the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he had such knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Appellant’s mobile phone records</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Appellant’s two mobile phones were examined by the Technology Crime Forensic Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department.

On the contrary, it could be viewed as being exculpatory of the Appellant. According to the Appellant, after he met Sulaimi outside the 7-Eleven store along Jalan Besar, Sulaimi asked him whether he wanted a drink. He said “yes” (although see, in this regard, our earlier observation at [32] above), and they then entered the 7-Eleven store. Sulaimi went to get his food and drink, while the Appellant got a drink for himself and passed it to Sulaimi for payment. They were in the store for only about five minutes. The Appellant then walked out of the store first to wait while Sulaimi paid for the food and drinks.

</div> In these circumstances, there is nothing suspicious about the fact that the Appellant did not pass the Bundles to Sulaimi while they were in the 7-Eleven store. Indeed, it is also not clear to us what is the “unspoken interaction” referred to by the Prosecution that allegedly “speaks volumes” about the “illicit transaction” between the Appellant and Sulaimi. The Appellant’s account of the events adequately explains why the Bundles were not handed to Sulaimi earlier before the Appellant was apprehended by CNB officers.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In any event, we do not see how the Appellant’s lack of urgency in handing the Bundles to Sulaimi lends weight to the Prosecution’s case that the Appellant knew that the Bundles contained drugs. If the Prosecution’s argument is that the Appellant should have been in greater haste because he was late for work, this would be true regardless of whether or not the Appellant knew that what he was carrying contained drugs. The Prosecution’s case is not that the Appellant lied about his intention to head to work after delivering the Bundles to Sulaimi and instead entered Singapore for the sole purpose of being a drug courier. On the contrary, we think the Appellant’s lack of urgency could and should be construed as corroborative of his defence that he did not know that what he was carrying contained drugs. If he had known that, one would have thought that he would have been in a greater hurry to hand over the Bundles and then leave the scene. It would not have made sense for him to hold onto the Bundles and enter the 7-Eleven store with Sulaimi, and thereby expose himself to greater risk. Anyone with knowledge that the contents of the Bundles were illicit would have lost no time in handing over the Bundles and getting away. It might be that after meeting Sulaimi, the Appellant thought that he could spare a few minutes while Sulaimi made a few purchases at the 7-Eleven store, given that he did not suspect that the Bundles contained anything illicit. In the circumstances, we do not think the Appellant’s conduct upon meeting Sulaimi is incriminating. On the contrary, it is <span class="font-italic">inconsistent</span> with his having guilty knowledge of the contents of the Bundles.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The point was also made that there was no conversation between the Appellant and Sulaimi after they met apart from Sulaimi asking the Appellant whether he wanted a drink. We do not see why the absence of small talk is indicative of anything sinister. How a person behaves in a given situation must necessarily depend on the nature of that person and the situation in question. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The unused roll of black tape in the Haversack</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Judge was of the view that the unused roll of black tape found in the Haversack “require[d] explanation” (see [10(d)] above). We are afraid he was wrong on this point. That unused roll of black tape might appear superficially similar to the black tape used to wrap the Bundles. However, it is clear from the expert evidence that while the black tape used to wrap the Bundles could all have originated from the same roll of tape, the unused roll of black tape found in the Haversack was <span class="font-italic">not associated</span> with the tape used to wrap the Bundles.

</div> In the circumstances, it seems to us that the unused roll of black tape found in the Haversack has no probative value in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Additionally, the Appellant has adequately explained why he had that unused roll of black tape in the Haversack. On the very day he was arrested, the Appellant told the CNB officers that that roll of tape was used to tape his mobile phone charger so as to prevent a short circuit when he charged his mobile phone while travelling in the lorry transporting him from PSA’s gate to the area within the premises where the prime movers were parked.

</div> Indeed, we note that there is <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> to suggest that the Appellant was promised any sort of reward for doing that “favour”.

</div> We disagree. In our view, the fact that the Appellant did not receive payment for carrying out the “favour” is strongly exculpatory. It is unlikely that the Appellant (or, for that matter, any person in similar circumstances) would have knowingly and willingly agreed to be a drug courier for a colleague of only three weeks <span class="font-italic">without </span>receiving any reward or benefit (whether monetary or otherwise) in return, especially given the high risk involved. The lack of reward is consistent with the Appellant’s assertion that he thought that in bringing the Bundles to Singapore for delivery to Sulaimi, he was simply doing Mogan an innocuous “favour”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Prosecution submits that it is not clear that no payment was promised to and/or received by the Appellant in return for doing the “favour” for Mogan. The Appellant admitted at the trial that he had previously sent a text message to Mogan with his Bank Rakyat account number (he could not, however, recall when he had sent Mogan that text message).

</div> The Prosecution suggests that the Appellant did so in order to receive payment from Mogan for carrying out the “favour”. This, however, is not borne out by the evidence. The Appellant explained on the witness stand that he had given Mogan his bank account number so that Mogan could help him deposit MYR 100 into his bank account since Mogan was going to Bank Rakyat on the day the aforesaid text message was sent.

</div> While the Appellant agreed that he was in no hurry to deposit the MYR 100 into his bank account, he maintained that he had asked Mogan to do so out of convenience since Mogan was going to the bank that day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We note that the Appellant’s explanation in respect of the aforesaid text message to Mogan is not externally corroborated by other evidence.

</div> and (b) this was neither the Prosecution’s case in the court below nor the Judge’s finding. In this regard, it is worth reiterating the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67, which we recently affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 141 at [48], that “where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission”. This squarely applies in the present case. Given that the Prosecution never put it to the Appellant that he sent Mogan the text message containing his bank account number in order to receive payment from Mogan for doing the “favour”, we do not think it is open to the Prosecution to now submit that that was the position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As such, on the present evidence, and in all fairness, there is no basis for this court to <span class="font-italic">speculate</span> that the Appellant received or was promised payment in return for doing the “favour” for Mogan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The absence of evidence from Mogan and Sulaimi at the trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Finally, we note that there was no evidence either in the court below or before us from Sulaimi and Mogan. It is clear to us that both of them are material and critical witnesses who would have been able to either corroborate or rebut the Appellant’s defence. At the trial, Investigating Officer Yeo Wee Beng informed the court that both Sulaimi and Mogan had already been arrested by the CNB, convicted and sentenced (in Sulaimi’s case, to five years and six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, and in Mogan’s case, to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane).

</div>
</div> Given that both Sulaimi and Mogan were held in custody at the time of the trial, it is curious that neither the Prosecution nor the Defence called them to testify. The court was thus deprived of the assistance which they could have given. We would only observe that the Prosecution would have known, from the statements which both Mogan and Sulaimi had given to the CNB, what they were likely to say if they were called as witnesses at the trial, while the same could not be said of the Appellant.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At the hearing of this appeal, we asked the parties whether any of Sulaimi’s and/or Mogan’s statements had been disclosed to the Defence, and why their evidence had not been adduced in the court below. Defence counsel clarified that he had not received any statements from the Prosecution pursuant to the latter’s disclosure obligations under <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”); neither had he asked the Prosecution whether any relevant statements existed. The Prosecution confirmed that it had not disclosed any of Sulaimi’s and/or Mogan’s statements to the Defence, but maintained that there were no statements which it was obliged to disclose pursuant to its <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> obligations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On the one hand, we would have thought that the Prosecution would have called Sulaimi and/or Mogan as witnesses to rebut the Appellant’s defence <span class="font-italic">if</span> their account of the events supported the Prosecution’s case that the Appellant was in the know throughout. On the other hand, while it is true that the Appellant could also have called Mogan and Sulaimi to testify for him at the trial, unlike the Prosecution, he would have done so without knowing what they were likely to say. To that extent, the Appellant was at a disadvantage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In conclusion, for the reasons given above, we accept the Appellant’s defence and find that he has discharged the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the drugs found in his possession.  It is vitally important not to view the actions and words of an accused in a case like this with lenses of someone who is familiar with the practices of the drug trade, unless there are facts warranting that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In coming to this conclusion, we are cognisant of the well-established principle that an appellate court should be slow to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact unless they are “plainly wrong” or reached “against the weight of the evidence”. However, it is also clear that these observations are especially pertinent where they hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses. In contrast, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual factual findings which have been made, the appellate court will be just as competent as the trial judge to draw the necessary inferences from the circumstances of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 at [24]). In the present case, there are, with respect, two findings of fact by the Judge that are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, namely, his findings in relation to the unused roll of black tape found in the Haversack (which expert evidence has shown is not associated with the tape used to wrap the Bundles) and the DNA evidence (which is inconclusive). We are also of the view that two of the Judge’s inferences from his factual findings are incorrect. First, we disagree that the factors identified by the Judge in his oral grounds (see [10] above) constitute suspicious circumstances (see [37]–[46] above). Second, we do not consider the Appellant’s conduct upon meeting Sulaimi to be suspicious (see [57]–[61] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The single point which stands in the way of our conclusion is the Appellant’s evidence that he did not know of Singapore’s strict drug laws. We have dealt with this point at [35]–[36] above. Notwithstanding this weakness in the Appellant’s defence, we do not think it sufficient to warrant our rejecting his defence completely. We therefore allow the appeal and acquit the Appellant of all the charges brought against him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon  Chao Hick Tin  <br/>Chief Justice    Judge of Appeal </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Tay Yong Kwang JA (dissenting):</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This is an appeal by Harven a/l Segar (“the Appellant”) against his conviction by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) on the following three charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”):

As the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2) of the MDA, the Judge decided not to impose the death penalty on the first charge and instead sentenced the Appellant to life imprisonment and the minimum of 15 strokes of the cane. On the second charge and the third charge, which, as mentioned earlier, were non-capital charges, the Judge imposed the minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for each charge. The two five-year imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently with each other but consecutively with the life imprisonment term with effect from 14 June 2013, the date of the Appellant’s remand. A day after imposing these sentences, the Judge rectified the order on consecutive sentences because s 307(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) provides that where life imprisonment is imposed, all other sentences of imprisonment must run concurrently with the life imprisonment sentence. The total sentence imposed was therefore life imprisonment with caning but limited to 24 strokes as provided in s 328(6) of the CPC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In the present case, it is undisputed that the Bundles containing the controlled drugs were found in the Appellant’s possession.

As a result, the Appellant is presumed, pursuant to s 18(2), to have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs contained in the Bundles and the burden falls on him to rebut that presumption by showing, on a balance of probabilities, that he had no knowledge of the nature of those controlled drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The majority decision of this court is that the Appellant should be acquitted on the ground that he has succeeded in rebutting the said presumption on a balance of probabilities.

</div> This is consistent with the fact that he did not know much about Mogan save for his place of work, his address and the fact that he was a divorcee. Thus, given that Mogan gave the Appellant practically no particulars concerning the “jaman” and their delivery, it is extremely surprising that the Appellant would have blindly followed Mogan’s instructions without a single question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The nature of the favours that the Appellant had allegedly done for Mogan (such as giving Mogan rides on his motorcycle and buying Mogan breakfast) was quite different from the nature of the “favour” that led to the Appellant’s arrest. That “favour” involved the delivery of goods across international borders with the nature of the goods totally unknown to the Appellant. In addition, the goods were wrapped in black tape and were in odd shapes. They were also reasonably heavy. The circumstances surrounding such a delivery across international borders would surely have raised suspicions in the mind of any ordinary person and the Appellant has given no evidence that he was an unquestioning simpleton. As a frequent traveller between Malaysia and Singapore, the Appellant was surely aware that whatever he was carrying could be subject to inspection by the authorities on both sides of the Causeway. If he were asked by the authorities what the Bundles contained, what was he going to say? He could not simply open the Bundles up for inspection, at least not without tearing the packaging apart and possibly damaging or spoiling the contents, because the Bundles were wrapped snugly in black tape.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As was held by this court in <span class="font-italic">Y</span><span class="font-italic">eo Choon Huat v Public Prosecutor</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 450 at [22], ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination. Clearly, the Appellant should have had ample reasons for suspicion and he had many opportunities to find out more about the delivery that Mogan asked him to make. According to the Appellant’s evidence at the trial, he was with Mogan for about 15 minutes on the evening of 12 June 2013 before he set out for Singapore.

</div> In contrast, according to his statement recorded on 16 June 2013 at 9.40am, he was actually at Mogan’s house for about 45 minutes, having arrived there at about 7.30pm to 7.45pm and having departed therefrom for Singapore at about 8.30pm (see paras 10 and 12 of that statement). However, I would give allowance for the time that Mogan could have taken before he “came down from his place” to meet the Appellant, and I would accept that the meeting that evening lasted for about 15 minutes. In any case, these estimated times were quite inaccurate since it was accepted in the SOAF that the Appellant actually entered Singapore at 8.15pm that day (see [76] above). Even so, the Appellant had more than sufficient time to ask Mogan about the things that were in the black plastic bag handed to him, especially since they felt heavy. However, without even a hint of curiosity, all that the Appellant asked Mogan was how he was supposed to contact Mogan’s friend in Singapore. Mogan’s response in any event did not state even the friend’s name or the friend’s telephone number for the Appellant to establish contact in Singapore. In my opinion, the Appellant did not ask Mogan for more information about the Bundles because he did not need to. He did not need to because in all probability, he was aware of their contents.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s nonchalance towards the “presents”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In his statements to the CNB and at the trial, the Appellant maintained that he believed the Bundles contained “presents”, without elaborating on what he thought the “presents” consisted of, as he asserted that presents were often wrapped in black tape before being sent by post in Malaysia. In my view, there was no basis for his belief that the Bundles contained presents and neither was there any real evidence to support his claim that presents were usually wrapped and posted in this manner in Malaysia. In any case, the evidence discussed below will show that the Appellant could not have believed that the Bundles were presents to be passed to Mogan’s friend in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 At this juncture, I should point out that there appeared to be an inconsistency between the SOAF and the Appellant’s oral testimony at the trial as to where in the Haversack the Bundles were placed. It was not disputed that the Haversack had three compartments. In the SOAF, it was stated that the CNB officers found the Bundles, together with the roll of black tape A4 (see [79(c)] above) and the Appellant’s personal property, in the “main compartment” rather than the centre compartment of the Haversack. However, in his statements to the CNB and throughout his oral testimony during the trial, the Appellant said that he had placed the Bundles in the “centre compartment” of the Haversack and both the Prosecution and the Defence proceeded on that basis without contention. There was no evidence that the Appellant shifted the Bundles from the centre compartment of the Haversack into the main compartment after passing through Woodlands Checkpoint and before riding his motorcycle to meet Sulaimi. The discrepancy was therefore probably due to the different terminology used for the three compartments of the Haversack. Accordingly, I will proceed on the undisputed basis that the Appellant placed the Bundles in the Haversack’s centre compartment in the circumstances set out below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the course of making his defence at the trial, the Appellant claimed that he transferred the Bundles into the Haversack because he noticed a tear at the side of the black plastic bag handed to him by Mogan. This reason for the transfer of the Bundles into the Haversack (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tear in the black plastic bag containing the Bundles) was not mentioned in the Appellant’s statements to the CNB. According to the Appellant, he turned the plastic bag containing the Bundles upside down and “poured” the Bundles into the centre compartment of the Haversack.

</div> When asked whether he was concerned that he might damage the Bundles by pouring them into the Haversack and pushing them into a corner, the Appellant said “no”, explaining that the Haversack was made of cotton, so “there was cotton all around”. Moreover, he had “slowly moved the [B]undles” and was “careful about how [he] placed [the Bundles]”. The Appellant explained that he could not place the Bundles in the basket at the front of his motorcycle because they would fall out. Although he did place the black plastic bag containing the Bundles in that basket during the journey from Mogan’s house to the petrol kiosk, that was a short journey lasting less than a minute. However, the Appellant’s professed care in handling the Bundles was at odds with his description in his statement to the CNB on 16 June 2013 at 9.40am of how he placed these bundles in the Haversack:

</div> which he had bought at the Indian food stall (see [91] above) in the same compartment where the Bundles were. During his oral testimony in court, the Appellant explained that there was curry in the packet of food that came wrapped in brown paper and in a plastic bag. Although the five packets of bread which he bought earlier at the petrol kiosk and which he placed in the same compartment of the Haversack were not likely to damage or contaminate the contents of the Bundles, surely cooked food with curry, whether piping hot or not, was quite a different matter. Yet, the Appellant could casually do what he did despite the very real possibility that the food items could spill out during his motorcycle trip into and around Singapore and damage or at least dirty the “presents”. If the Appellant did not know what the Bundles contained and if he genuinely believed that they were presents, he would not have treated them so carelessly. The evidence showed clearly that the Appellant knew that the contents of the Bundles were not fragile even though they were not hard items and that they had been securely protected from damage or from contamination. That in turn must lead to the conclusion that the Appellant was aware of what the Bundles truly contained. There was also the question of why he kept putting things into the centre compartment of the Haversack when the Haversack had two other compartments and this will be discussed further below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The alleged Customs check at Woodlands Checkpoint</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 At the trial, the Appellant attempted to show that he did not try to conceal the Bundles while he was at Woodlands Checkpoint but actually opened voluntarily the centre compartment of the Haversack (where the Bundles were) for inspection:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Even though this point was not pursued by the Prosecution during its cross-examination of the Appellant, I am not able to place any weight on the Appellant’s evidence about the alleged Customs check for a number of reasons. Firstly, the alleged Customs check surfaced in evidence only at the trial, some two years and three months after the Appellant’s arrest. The Appellant did not mention it at all in any of his eight statements to the CNB. This raises the question of whether there was really such an inspection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Secondly, it is common knowledge that not every traveller’s belongings are subject to inspection at Singapore’s checkpoints. If the Haversack was subject to inspection at Woodlands Checkpoint on the night of 12 June 2013, then the Appellant must have been instructed by a customs officer there to open it for inspection. On this basis, the Appellant’s opening of the centre compartment of the Haversack was something he could not have avoided anyway. Thirdly, assuming that there was a request to the Appellant to open the Haversack for inspection, he did not say that he voluntarily showed the customs officer all the items in the centre compartment or that he took them out of the Haversack. Therefore, the Appellant’s response to the question in the extract quoted at [110] above as to whether there was anything concealing the Bundles could not be correct in the light of all that he had said about his seeming predilection for putting things into the centre compartment of the Haversack. On the contrary, there were at least several other items in the centre compartment at that point in time that could have prevented the customs officer from noticing the presence of the Bundles which were wrapped in black tape and carefully pushed into one corner of that compartment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In my opinion, the evidence showed that the Appellant was conscious of the need to keep the Bundles away from sight. It will be recalled that the black plastic bag which contained the Bundles was initially placed by the Appellant in the basket at the front of his motorcycle. Shortly afterwards, the Bundles were poured into the centre compartment of the Haversack and pushed into a corner. The Appellant also placed the five packets of bread that he had bought at the petrol kiosk

</div> (see [90] above) into the same compartment. After that, came the packet of Indian cooked food with curry. Other than the packets of bread and the packet of cooked food, the compartment containing the Bundles also held the Appellant’s miscellaneous personal belongings such as a red Singtel pouch, a handkerchief, a mobile phone charger, a car charger, many sockets, an LCD screen cleaning kit, a plastic container with one earpiece, a piece of blue cloth and an Allen key.

</div> The circumstances therefore showed that the Appellant was trying to keep the Bundles away from sight by placing them in one corner at the bottom of the centre compartment of the Haversack. As I have indicated earlier, this also showed that he had no concern that the alleged presents in the Bundles could be damaged by all his other belongings in the same compartment. This was clearly one of the factors that pointed to his knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. I mention here in passing that by the time the Appellant arrived at Jalan Besar to meet the intended recipient of the Bundles (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Sulaimi), he had apparently taken the packet of cooked food out from the Haversack and placed it somewhere on his motorcycle, presumably in the basket at the front, because the CNB officers found the packet of cooked food on the motorcycle, as stated in the SOAF.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s conduct upon meeting Sulaimi </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The Appellant’s conduct upon meeting Sulaimi was a further factor that pointed towards his knowledge of the “jaman” that he had been asked to deliver. The Appellant said nothing to Sulaimi when they met at Jalan Besar. Neither did Sulaimi say anything to him except to ask whether he wanted a drink. While they were in the 7-Eleven Store, there was again no interaction concerning the “jaman”. The Appellant’s conduct during his meeting with Sulaimi must be examined in the light of the events that day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As the Judge pointed out in his oral judgment, the sole purpose of the Appellant’s trip from Woodlands to Jalan Besar was to deliver the Bundles to Sulaimi. It was thus baffling that there was no interaction between Sulaimi and the Appellant when they met other than Sulaimi asking the Appellant whether he wanted a drink. There was no mention at all about the Bundles that the Appellant was supposed to deliver. The Appellant’s apparent lack of urgency and his unhurried demeanour at that meeting were even more baffling given that he could not afford to be late for work that day. This was because, earlier that day at 6.11pm, the Appellant had received a text message from his boss at his workplace which stated: “[i]f u go mia I m going to cancel your permit”.

</div> since he had been absent from work for the preceding two days. According to the Appellant, he had also told Sulaimi while they were speaking over the mobile phone before their meeting at Jalan Besar that he was already late for work (see [93] above). In those circumstances, the natural thing for the Appellant to do would have been to do the favour quickly for Mogan by delivering the Bundles and then head off to work immediately. After all, there was no instruction from Mogan to collect money from the recipient of the “jaman” or to do anything else besides handing over the “jaman”. Mysteriously, the Appellant appeared to have forgotten all these once he established contact with the recipient, who was said to be a stranger to him.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 During cross-examination, the Appellant said that he was worried about being late for work and had informed Sulaimi about it when Sulaimi went into the 7-Eleven Store.

</div> This alleged exchange, besides making no sense given the urgent circumstances that the Appellant was in at that moment in time, was not even mentioned in any of his statements to the CNB. On the contrary, the Appellant stated clearly in his statement recorded on 16 June 2013 at 3.05pm that he did not say anything about the “jaman” to Sulaimi after they met outside the 7-Eleven Store. In that same statement, the Appellant also seemed to suggest that the only interaction between him and Sulaimi was when Sulaimi asked whether he wanted a drink. The relevant paragraphs of that statement are set out below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25. I then got off my motorbike, JPG 3592 to meet the man. I was still carrying my black backpack containing the 3 black ‘jaman’. I had the backpack with me all the while. Nobody else had access to the backpack. When the man approached me outside the 7-Eleven store, he asked me in Malay “Awa mau minum ka?” (Recorder’s notes: The Malay phrase meant ‘whether you wanted a drink’). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The man did not say anything else.</span> Since I was thirsty, I answered ‘yes’ in Malay. The man appeared to be normal and he spoke to me very calmly. When the man asked me if I wanted any drink in Malay, I recognized his voice as the same one which I had heard over the phone. It was the same voice, in a very calm tone. This is the first time that I have seen this man. I have never seen him before previously.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26. The man then entered the 7-Eleven store and I followed him. Inside the store, the man went to get some food and drink. I then got a bottle of orange juice for myself and passed it to the man for him to pay. I told the man that I needed this drink in Malay and passed the bottle to him. The man and I did not talk any further. Inside the 7-Eleven store, I had yet to pass the ‘jaman’ to him. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I did not say anything about the “jaman” to the man in the 7</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">-Eleven store. The man did not ask anything about the ‘jaman’ as well.</span> Since the man wanted to get food, I thought I waited till he finished buying his food before I passed the “jaman” to him. We were inside the store for about 5 minutes. After I passed the bottle of orange to the man, I left the 7-Eleven store, while the man paid for his food and the drinks. After I walked out of the store, I sat on a slab of stone near the pavement. Moments later, before I could get up, I was arrested by some plain-clothes men. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 It can be seen from the above that a man in a hurry because his job was at stake was apparently calm and suddenly nonchalant about time, said nothing about the “jaman” that he was supposed to deliver to the stranger when they met and did not even try to hand over the “jaman” to him. Indeed, the Appellant did not even take the Bundles out of the Haversack. Instead, he was willing to waste more time waiting for the stranger to purchase food and drinks. Up to that point in time, the Appellant did not even know the recipient’s name. All these, in my view, led irresistibly to the inference that the meeting between the Appellant and Sulaimi on the night of 12 June 2013 was not for the simple act of handing over presents or some other legitimate stuff to an unknown friend of a friend.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s provision of his Bank Rakyat account number to Mogan   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Appellant claimed that Mogan did not promise him any payment for delivering the Bundles. When confronted with a text message which showed that he had provided Mogan with his Bank Rakyat account number, the Appellant claimed that he had done so for the purpose of enabling Mogan to deposit cash into his (the Appellant’s) bank account. According to the Appellant, on a previous occasion, he handed MYR 100 to Mogan for him to deposit on his behalf because Mogan left work earlier on that day. Again, such an explanation makes no sense. The Appellant left for Johor Bahru every morning after finishing work at PSA. Why was there a need to deposit MYR 100 into his Bank Rakyat account urgently? Further, the Appellant appeared to be in constant need of money and was highly unlikely to have had spare cash to deposit. He said that he would withdraw all his salary the moment it was credited into his bank account in Singapore

</div> For these reasons, I could not accept the Appellant’s explanation on why he had provided his Bank Rakyat account number to Mogan. Instead, the evidence pointed clearly to the much higher likelihood that it was to enable Mogan to pay him for the illegal work done on Mogan’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 V K Rajah J (as he then was, sitting as the trial judge in the High Court) said in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Kiam Peng </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 522 at [11] that when apprentice couriers are apprehended, they will “almost invariably vigorously assert their innocence” and that “such denials of knowledge must be scrupulously analysed and warily assessed for consistency and credibility”.

</div> In this context, it would be apposite to note again the observations of Rajah J in the case cited above, at [12]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It bears emphasis that at all border control points and on all immigration entry cards, the mandatory penalties inextricably linked to trafficking or consuming drugs are clearly and unequivocally articulated. As a consequence, one can almost invariably assume that all persons entering Singapore would have been sufficiently alerted and sensitised of the need to take measures enabling them to ascertain the contents and nature of any substance they transport into or within Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, having worked here for three years and having entered Singapore on numerous occasions, the Appellant could not have been ignorant of all the warnings about bringing illegal drugs into Singapore. He must have been aware of our strict drug laws and was therefore being untruthful in his denial that he had such knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In addition, despite the attempts to portray the Appellant as a guileless person, I think the Appellant is a fairly intelligent man who was not as naïve as he was made out to be. Firstly, as pointed out by the Prosecution in the trial court, during medical check-ups done for the purpose of renewing his work permit, the Appellant was sharp enough to notice a specific question in the medical form asking whether he had taken drugs before. Yet, he claimed that he was not aware of the warning notices on drug trafficking which he would have come across each time he travelled to Singapore.

For example, he claimed that he had “poured” the Bundles into the centre compartment of the Haversack and then “pushed” them to one corner. When he was asked if he was worried that the Bundles would be damaged, he quickly added that he had taken care in placing the Bundles in the Haversack. This was despite his own description about how the Bundles were “poured” into the Haversack. Another example may be found in his answers in cross-examination on his interaction with Sulaimi.

</div> and were available as witnesses during the trial. Mogan had by then been sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane while Sulaimai had been sentenced to imprisonment of five years and six months and three strokes of the cane. Mogan would have been the best person to corroborate the Appellant’s assertion of his lack of knowledge of the contents of the Bundles. However, neither the Prosecution nor counsel for the Appellant decided to call Mogan or Sulaimi to testify at the trial. Upon whom then should the duty fall to call one or both of these witnesses to testify? In such a situation, the operation and effect of the legal presumptions under the MDA become highly significant. The Bundles containing the controlled drugs were found in the Appellant’s possession, thereby enabling the Prosecution to invoke the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA respectively. In relation to the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2), it was the Appellant who bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he had no knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs in his possession. It was not the duty of the Prosecution to call evidence to prove that the Appellant did not lack knowledge of the drugs in his possession because the s 18(2) presumption, once invoked, meant that the Appellant had knowledge of the nature of the drugs and the Prosecution was entitled to rest its case on that fact, leaving the Appellant to provide evidence to rebut the presumption (see the recent decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] SGCA 12 at [33]–[40] of that judgment). If the Appellant did so, the Prosecution would then have to decide whether or not it was necessary to call evidence to rebut the Appellant’s evidence. Since the Appellant’s defence turned on his claim that he was simply doing Mogan a favour by delivering some “presents” to Mogan’s friend, it was open to, and indeed incumbent upon, the Appellant to call Mogan as his witness and to apply to cross-examine him if necessary. However, according to the Appellant’s counsel, the Appellant made a considered decision not to call Mogan as his witness at the trial. It should be noted too that the same counsel had also acted for Mogan when Mogan was brought to court to answer his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 While the Appellant’s decision not to call Mogan and/or Sulaimi as witnesses was not conclusive of his guilt, the absence of these two men, particularly Mogan, from the trial meant that there was no independent evidence supporting the Appellant’s defence. Even if we leave aside any issue of adverse inferences to be drawn against the Appellant for failing to call Mogan and/or Sulaimi as witnesses, their absence, coupled with the suspicious circumstances surrounding the delivery of the Bundles and the Appellant’s lack of credibility, leads clearly to the conclusion that the Appellant has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge set out in s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The DNA evidence, the extra mobile phone HS-HP1 and the roll of black tape A4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In arriving at my decision on the Appellant’s guilt, I did not rely on the following evidence: (a) the presence of the Appellant’s DNA on the adhesive side of the black tape used to wrap A2; (b) the extra mobile phone HS-HP1 found in the Appellant’s possession; and (c) the roll of black tape A4 found in the Haversack. In respect of the DNA evidence, the argument was that there was a possibility that the Appellant’s DNA could have been left on the adhesive side of the black tape wrapped around A2 if he had touched an exposed part of the adhesive side of the tape because the forensic evidence did not specify the exact part of the tape that contained the Appellant’s DNA. The HSA has said that it was theoretically impossible that that could have happened here. I think the possibility is remote but I see no need to rely on the DNA evidence to establish the Appellant’s guilt. I also do not think that the extra mobile phone HS-HP1 which Mogan handed to the Appellant added much to the Prosecution’s case. As for the roll of black tape A4, the scientific analysis

</div> showed that it was not associated with the black tape used to wrap the Bundles and therefore, it could not suggest that the Appellant had participated in the wrapping of the Bundles. To this extent, I think the Judge was wrong when he said in his oral judgment that the presence of A4 in the Appellant’s possession “requires explanation” from the Appellant. Further, if that meant that the Appellant had assisted in the wrapping of the Bundles, it would contradict the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant had merely been performing the job of a courier within the meaning of s 33B of the MDA. In any event, these three pieces of evidence are either immaterial or irrelevant to me in my evaluation of the entire case before the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The onus is on the Appellant to rebut the presumptions of possession and of knowledge of the nature of the drugs in<span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,153,0,1)"> </span>ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA. The Appellant has attempted to do so by claiming that he thought that the Bundles were presents, without elaborating on the nature of the presents. Presents may also contain prohibited things. Such a defence is no different in effect from the not-uncommonly heard plaintive plea of “I really didn’t know they were drugs but I also didn’t know what they were”. In my opinion, such a defence has to be examined in the context of the factual situation in any particular case. On the evidence adduced in this case, I do not think the Appellant has managed to rebut the legal presumption of knowledge in any way. The Judge was therefore correct in convicting the Appellant on all three charges. There is no appeal against the sentences but I would add that I also see no reason to disagree with the Judge regarding his finding that the Appellant was a courier within the meaning of s 33B of the MDA and with his decision on sentence. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ram Goswami (Ram Goswami) and Cheng Kim Kuan (K K Cheng &amp; Co) for the appellant;<br/>Kwek Mean Luck, Tan Wen Hsien and Sarah Shi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
