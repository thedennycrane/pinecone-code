A resulting trust is presumed to arise if the transferee does not provide the whole of the consideration for the transfer to the transferor. What is being presumed is that the transferor lacked the intention to benefit the transferee. It is that lack of intention that gives rise to a resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35], citing Robert Chambers, <span class="font-italic">Resulting Trusts </span>(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1997) at p 32.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The presumption of advancement operates when a transferor and a transferee are in one of a limited number of relationships. When the presumption of advancement operates, the transferor is presumed to intend to benefit the transferee unless there is evidence to the contrary. This presumed intention makes it is no longer possible to find that the transferor lacked the intention to benefit the transferee. That suffices, in itself, to prevent a resulting trust from arising.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Relying on these two presumptions should be the last resort in ascertaining disputing parties’ proprietary rights. The presumptions operate only where there is no direct evidence that may reveal the intention of the transferor (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [59]). This is because both the presumption of resulting trust and the presumption of advancement amount to imputing an intention to a transferor. There is an important conceptual difference between an imputed intention on the one hand and an express or inferred intention on the other. An imputed intention involves attributing to a person an intention even though that intention cannot be deduced from his actions and statements and regardless of whether he actually had any such intention (<span class="font-italic">Stack v Dowden</span> [2007] 2 AC 432 (“<span class="font-italic">Stack</span>”) at [125]–[127] per Lord Neuberger). It is for this reason that reliance on these two presumptions should be a last resort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I consider it appropriate in this case to rely on these two presumptions in ascertaining the parties’ proprietary rights. The central issue is whether the Father lacked the intention to benefit the defendant at the time the Property was purchased. Like the father in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Father in the present case is no longer alive. He cannot give direct evidence of his actual intention within the meaning of s 62(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Ed). Nor is there any objective evidence before me capable of proving, either directly or by inference, what his actual intention was with regard to the right of survivorship (subject to my assumption (see [36] above)). It is therefore appropriate to rely on the presumptions and on circumstantial evidence to determine his intention with regard to the right of survivorship: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [50]–[51], citing <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [59].

If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit that other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e)  If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then: (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is registered in Y’s sole name (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Y will be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is registered in their joint names.

That is because the defendant contributed nothing whatsoever to the purchase of the Property. The defendant is therefore presumed to hold his legal interest in the Property on a resulting trust for the Father from the date the Property was purchased: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Tan Choo Suan (in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Toen, deceased) and others and other matters</span> [2015] SGHC 306 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>”) at [216].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The question then is whether the Father intended to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship (subject to the assumption I have made at [36] above).

His intention at any other time, whether earlier or later, is legally irrelevant.

I say that for two reasons. First, the available evidence is insufficient to prove on the balance of probabilities that the Father intended to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship. Second, in my view, the presumption of advancement arises only weakly in this case and is rebutted by circumstances warranting the inference that the father had no intention to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No evidence of the Father’s intention to benefit the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The defendant relies on five critical facts to argue that the Father intended to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. Sometime in August 1995, I met up with my father and mother at the family home…. After we finalized the wedding arrangements, my father said that he was purchasing the Property and both of us will “join name” (“联名” in Cantonese). It was his intention that I would inherit the Property because I was his only son. I was also getting married and he would have intended to provide for me and my new family as well. As far as I know, my father had similarly inherited everything my grandfather owned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Even if I take the defendant’s account of this meeting at its highest, it does not warrant the inference that the defendant invites me to draw from it as to the Father’s intention. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, according to the defendant, all that the Father said at this meeting was that the Father was purchasing the Property and that he and the defendant would “join name”. The phrase “join name” says nothing expressly or impliedly about the Father’s intention to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship or with any other interest in the Property. The defendant relies solely on the Father’s use of this phrase to advance two submissions about the Father’s intention: (a) that the Father intended that the defendant “would inherit” the Property just as the Father had inherited the Business from his own father (the defendant’s grandfather) because the defendant was the Father’s only son; and (b) the Father “would have” intended to provide for the defendant and his new family in view of the defendant’s impending marriage.

When pressed on this point, the defendant suggested faintly that the Father had in fact used some additional words to convey his alleged intention to benefit the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> some words additional to the phrase “join name”.

</div> I consider the defendant’s evidence that the Father used some unspecified additional words to be clearly an afterthought on the defendant’s part. I reject that evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, the understanding or sense that a lay person speaking without the benefit of legal advice would be most likely to convey by using the phrase “join name” in connection with the purchase of property is that the two jointly named owners are to be immediate and absolute co-owners of the property. Such a person would not intend to convey anything about the legal distinction between a tenancy in common creating proprietary interests that endure beyond death of a joint owner or a joint tenancy creating a proprietary interest that terminates upon the death of a joint owner. A lay person would be even less likely to think of the infinitely more subtle and technical legal distinction between ownership at common law and ownership in equity. The inherent probabilities are therefore that the Father would have meant by the words “join name” simply that he and the defendant were to be immediate joint owners of the Property, with an equal and immediate right to enjoy the Property, either by using it or by deriving an income from it, without giving any thought to what was to happen to the Property after one of them died. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 But that is not the defendant’s case as to the Father’s intention. The defendant’s case is that the Father intended to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property during his lifetime, to the exclusion of the defendant and that the Father intended by the words “join name” only that the defendant would “inherit” the Property upon the Father’s death. I consider it inherently and highly improbable that the Father intended to convey this intention by the phrase “join name”. The defendant’s case requires me to accept that the Father formed <span class="font-italic">one</span> intention that the Father was to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property during his lifetime even though the defendant was a “join name” and formed an entirely <span class="font-italic">separate</span> intention that the defendant was to become the sole and absolute owner of the Property when the Father died. Lay persons, particularly family members, do not generally think about the manner in which they are to hold interests in property at all, let alone at such depth and in such sophisticated terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Third, the defendant uses the word “inherit” to describe the Father’s intention at this meeting (see [51] above).

But even if the Father intended this, there are many routes by which he could have achieved that intention. The most obvious route, and the one that an unsophisticated lay person such as the Father would most likely intend, would be to make a gift of the Property to the defendant by will. I consider it inherently improbable that the Father would have intended a purchase in “join name” to mean a purchase as joint tenants and would have intended the resulting right of survivorship to be the route by which to achieve his intention. Indeed, even on the defendant’s case, the earliest that the Father was legally advised that the right of survivorship was an incident of a joint tenancy was September 1995, well after this meeting. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Meeting with the conveyancing solicitors in September 1995</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The second critical fact that the defendant relies on is that the Father understood the legal nature of a joint tenancy and that the consequence of purchasing the Property with the defendant as a joint tenant was that the defendant would become the sole and absolute owner of the Property when the Father died by the right of survivorship.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is not disputed that this meeting took place. Having regard to the legal and ethical duties of conveyancing solicitors acting for a purchaser of real property, I consider the inherent probabilities to be that the solicitors did explain to the Father the legal nature and consequences of purchasing the Property as a joint tenant, and that they did so in a language and in a manner that he could and did understand. Moreover, where a party is legally represented at the time of purchasing property as a joint tenant, the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inference to be drawn is that that party gave informed consent to hold the property as joint tenants at law: see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [137].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 But I do not accept the defendant’s submission that the Father’s understanding of the explanation is evidence of the Father’s intention to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship. To my mind, there are many equally plausible reasons for the Father to agree to purchase the Property as a joint tenant with knowledge of the nature and consequences of a joint tenancy. The Father could simply have been indifferent to the legal consequence of holding the Property with the defendant as a joint tenant because the Father intended to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property during his lifetime. The defendant himself concedes that, as the Property’s sole beneficial owner, it was within the Father’s power during his lifetime to destroy the defendant’s right of survivorship without the defendant’s consent simply by removing the defendant as a joint tenant.

</div> Given that concession, the Father could equally have destroyed the defendant’s right of survivorship by selling the Property. He could even have diluted the defendant’s right of survivorship by adding more joint tenants, whether other family members or even strangers. He could also have hollowed out the defendant’s right of survivorship by raising further loans on the security of the Property. Given all of this, I consider it more likely that the Father accepted the solicitors’ explanation of the nature and consequences of a joint tenancy because he intended to be the Property’s sole and absolute beneficial owner during his lifetime and was therefore indifferent to what was to happen to the Property after his death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Further, even if the Father was not indifferent to what was to happen to the Property after his death and formed an intention in that regard, I consider it unlikely that that intention was to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship in the Property.

</div> By accepting the HDB’s offer, the Father secured for the Business three considerable advantages. First, he freed the Business from the obligation to pay rent and replaced it with an obligation to repay the DBS loan. That allowed him to divert the money that would have gone towards paying an expense into building equity in an asset, with the possibility of that asset enjoying capital appreciation over the tenor of the loan. The Father would also have anticipated that, by the time of his death, he would have repaid the DBS loan in full, thereby allowing the Business to occupy the Property free even of interest costs. Second, he acquired premises from which the Business could operate permanently. The business would not have to move again as it had been forced to in 1985. Third, he freed the Business from the risk of the rent escalating yearly, as it had from 1985 to 1995. The defendant accepts all of this.

</div> I therefore consider it far more likely that – if the Father formed any intention at all about what was to happen to the Property after his death – his intention would have been that the Property should continue to be a permanent location from which the Business could operate cost-free. I consider it unlikely that the Father would have intended, upon his death, to make the defendant the new landlord of the Business and to expose the Business to a potential obligation to pay rent for the first time since 1995.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Second, it appears to me unlikely that the Father intended that the Property should pass solely and absolutely to the defendant immediately upon the Father’s death. I bear in mind the Father’s and the family’s straitened financial circumstances in 1995. That suggests that the Father would want the Business and the Property to continue as a single commercial and economic unit under common ownership to provide financially for the Mother after his death. I consider it highly unlikely that the Father would intend the Property to go to the defendant while the Business went to the Mother. The Father would have expected that the defendant would, by the time of the Father’s death, be financially independent and be under a duty to provide financially for his own family. The Father would have been aware that the defendant may well, quite naturally and understandably, prioritise that duty over a filial duty to provide financially for the widowed Mother. It therefore appears to me likely that, if the Father formed any intention at all about what was to happen to the Property after his death, that intention was for the Property and the Business to support the Mother in her widowhood rather than to benefit the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The question remains why the Father went ahead and named the defendant as a joint tenant knowing the legal consequence of doing so if he had no intention to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship. On this point, I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that doing so allowed the Father to get better terms for the loan from DBS. The defendant was the youngest child of the family. He was also then in a stable job with a sufficiently high salary. The Father named the defendant not only as a joint tenant for the Property but also as a joint borrower for the loan from DBS. Having the defendant as a joint borrower allowed the Father to secure a loan from DBS at a lower interest rate and on a longer tenor. This reduced the monthly repayments significantly.

</div> This, in turn, eased the burden on the limited cashflow generated by the Business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For all these reasons, I do not accept that the Father’s knowledge of the nature and consequence of a joint tenancy is evidence that he intended to benefit the defendant with the right of survivorship. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3)  The defendant was a joint borrower under the DBS loan</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The third critical fact that the defendant relies on is that the defendant was a joint borrower under the DBS loan.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I reject this submission for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, inaction in itself is equivocal. A person’s inaction is therefore incapable of forming a basis for drawing any inference about his intention. I have already found that the Father was indifferent in 1995 as to what was to happen to the Property after his death; alternatively, that to the extent that he formed any intention at all in this regard, it is more likely than not that he intended the Business to continue to use the Property as permanent premises from which to operate after his death cost free for the benefit of the Mother in her widowhood. The Father’s inaction in 2016 is quite clearly equivocal in that it is equally capable of supporting three different inferences about his intention in 1995: (a) that his intention in 2016 had not changed from his intention in 1995; (b) that he was indifferent as to what would happen to the Property after his death, or (c) that he intended to benefit the defendant. There is simply no basis in the Father’s inaction after repaying the loan from DBS to draw any inference that his intention in 2016 was any different from his intention in 1995. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendant cites <span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye v Koh Ah Leng </span>[2021] SGCA 69 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye</span>”) at [41] as authority for the proposition that a person’s inaction with regard to a property can be a basis from which to draw an inference about his intention to benefit another with an interest in that property. But <span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye</span> was not a case of an inference drawn from inaction alone. The inference in that case was drawn from a combination of positive action that carried a probative connection to the relevant intention which was then followed by inaction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In <span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye</span>, a father took the positive step of seeking legal advice on how to remove all of his sons as joint owners of a property with him. He was advised that doing so would incur stamp duty. He then took no further action. He died about a decade later. The father’s positive action in seeking legal advice on extinguishing his sons’ right of survivorship followed by legal advice on the disadvantages of doing so and his inaction for over a decade was quite clearly a sufficient basis from which to infer that he accepted all of his sons as joint owners of the property and intended to benefit them by naming them as joint owners of the property at the time of purchase (<span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye </span>at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the Father’s inaction in failing to remove the defendant as a joint owner of the Property was not preceded by any positive action or a context (such as the legal advice in <span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye</span>) that can resolve the equivocal nature of his inaction and give it a positive dimension. I therefore do not consider that <span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye</span> assists the defendant at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 My second reason for rejecting this submission is that the defendant’s own case is that the Father was the sole beneficial owner of the Property during his lifetime,

The defendant is therefore forced to separate the Father’s intention with respect to: (a) the beneficial interest in the Property during the Father’s lifetime; and (b) the right of survivorship arising upon the Father’s death. As authority for separating the father’s donative intent in this way, the defendant relies on the extension to the presumption of advancement recognised in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I reject the defendant’s alternative submission for three reasons. First, a right of survivorship is not a right of property capable of being in itself the subject matter of a gift or a trust. Second, the defendant’s reliance on the extension of the presumption of advancement in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> is not well-founded. Finally, and in any event, I consider that the presumption of advancement has been rebutted on the facts of this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Right of survivorship is not property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It is not possible to make a gift of a right of survivorship arising from a joint tenancy of property. The right of survivorship is not property, whether tangible or intangible and whether a chose in possession or a chose in action. The right of survivorship is simply the legal consequence of holding property as joint tenants. It is inseparable as a proprietary right from the joint tenancy itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Since the right of survivorship is not property, it cannot be the subject of a gift or a trust. The only way for the Father to split his interest in the Property temporally into a life interest vested in him and a right to the Property upon his death accruing to the defendant would have been by declaring an express trust to that effect. But the Father did not do that. On this basis alone, the defendant’s alternative submission fails, without even considering the scope or operation of the presumption of advancement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Even if I were to assume that a right of survivorship is property and is capable of forming the subject matter of a gift or a trust, I consider that the defendant’s reliance on the extension to the presumption of advancement in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> is not well founded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The extension of the presumption of advancement in Lau Siew Kim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As the legal basis of his alternative submission, the defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Si</span><span class="font-italic">ew Kim</span>. In that case, at [105]–[106], the Court of Appeal suggested that the presumption of a resulting trust need not relate to the entire beneficial interest in the trust property such that, for example, it is possible for one joint owner: (a) to hold a life interest in the property free of any trust while holding the remainder on a presumed resulting trust for the joint owner who has made a larger contribution; or (b) to hold a life interest in the property on a presumed resulting trust for the joint owner who has made a larger contribution while holding the remainder free of any trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">105 … The displacement of the presumption of advancement … is based on the traditional understanding and application of the presumption as one which operates to give the entire beneficial interest of the property to the wife immediately. On our extension of the presumption, the intention that is presumed is not an intention to give absolutely with immediate effect, but, rather, for the rule of survivorship to operate to pass the absolute interest of the property to the survivor of the two spouses. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a resulting trust need not necessarily relate to the entire interest in the property. <span class="font-italic">The presumption of resulting trust may be rebutted as to a life </span><span class="font-italic">interest, but may still operate in respect of the interest in remainder</span>: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Napier v Public Trustee</span> (1980) 32 ALR 153. <span class="font-italic">Conversely, the intention may be that the contributing party should receive the income from the purchased property during his life – to this extent the resulting trust prevails, but the property should belong to the benefiting party after his death</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the resulting trust is rebutted as to the remainder: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Young</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sealey</span> [1949] Ch 278. We are of the view that the presumption of advancement could similarly operate with respect to only part of the interest in the property in question; it may be rebutted as to the life interest of a property but prevail as to the remainder – one such case would be where a property is held on joint tenancy and it is inferred that there is an intention for the rule of survivorship to operate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The defendant’s reliance on this passage in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> is misplaced for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 First, it is not the defendant’s case that the Father had a mere life interest in the Property. The defendant concedes that the Father was the sole beneficial owner of the Property during his lifetime. But he also accepts that the Father was free to remove the defendant as a joint tenant, to add other joint tenants or to raise further loans on the security of the Property without seeking the defendant’s consent. That is quite different from the Father having a life interest under a trust. A person holding a life interest does not have the right or power to destroy, dilute or hollow out the remainderman’s interests. Whatever the scope of the extension to the presumption of advancement in Lau Siew Kim, it does not extend to the interest that the Father had in the Property on the defendant’s own case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Second, the <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> from <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>on which the defendant relies must be read in context. The context makes it clear that the Court of Appeal here was extending the presumption of advancement only as it arises between spouses.  That context is clear from [101]–[102] of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">101 The weight of the authorities seem to favour a pragmatic approach to the presumption of resulting trust in cases involving married spouses. The strength of the presumption appears to be much weaker in cases where married spouses who contribute jointly (whether in equal proportions or otherwise) to the purchase of a property (in particular, their matrimonial homes) hold that property as legal joint tenants. In such instances, there is a presumptive inference that the parties intended to hold the property as joint tenants in equity as well. In our judgment, this position usually accords with reality; indeed, <span class="font-italic">the operation of the rule of survivorship is consistent with the practical workings of an ordinary, caring matrimonial relationship</span>. However, instead of considering this inference at the stage of the presumption of resulting trust, <span class="font-italic">we are of the view that it is more appropriately accommodated within the framework of the presumption of advancement which should, in any event, be raised and applied in cases concerning spouses</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">102 In fact, Mason and Brennan JJ had also proposed that Lord Upjohn’s inference might be able to qualify the presumption of advancement in favour of a wife. This was raised at 260 where they remarked:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]t can be said that the antiquity of the presumption of advancement does not preclude the elevation of such an inference to the level of a presumption to be applied where the absence of the spouses’ common intention leaves room for its operation. The doctrines of equity are not ossified in history …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We agree with this approach. <span class="font-italic">The presumption of advancement that already arises between husband and wife may be developed and extended to additionally apply in the situation where married spouses purchase property as legal joint tenants; an intention may be inferred on the part of the contributing spouse(s) for the operation of the rule of survivorship. In a typical caring and amiable matrimonial relationship, it will be more probable than not that the parties intended the absolute beneficial ownership of the property to be conferred on the survivor.</span> As is the case for the other applications of the presumption of advancement, a fact-sensitive approach must be taken as well. The nature and state of the relationship are similarly essential when considering the application of the presumption of advancement where spouses hold property as legal joint tenants. In addition, other factors such as the nature of the purchase of the property itself may affect the strength of the presumption; where the property was purchased as a matrimonial home for the parties and did indeed so serve, the stronger the presumption that both spouses intended for the rule of survivorship to operate and for the beneficial ownership of the property to devolve to the surviving spouse absolutely.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The extension to the presumption of advancement in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> recognises the very real truth that most spouses who hold property as joint tenants at law with each other but who have made unequal contributions to its purchase intend to hold the property as joint tenants in equity as well, rather than as tenants in common in equity. That is to ensure that, upon the death of one spouse, the entire beneficial interest in the property passes automatically in equity to the surviving spouse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 There is a strong basis for presuming the intention of one spouse that, upon his death, the other spouse should enjoy the entire beneficial interest in the property for the remainder of his or her life rather than for it to pass, typically to the next generation, under the deceased’s will or intestacy. Where spouses purchase property as an investment, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> to generate an income or capital gains, it is very likely that the deceased spouse intended that the surviving spouse should continue to enjoy the income from the property for the rest of her life or to realise the appreciation in its capital value during her life. There is a particularly strong basis for presuming this intention where spouses purchase the property, not as an investment, but to be their matrimonial home. Each spouse is very likely to intend that, upon the other spouses’ death, the surviving spouse should become the sole and absolute owner of the property and have a place to reside for the rest of her life before the property can pass to the next generation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 One approach to recognising this reality is to deny that the presumption of resulting trust operates where spouses make unequal contributions to the purchase of property as joint tenants. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> considered and rejected this approach. Instead, the Court of Appeal favoured the alternative approach of accepting that the presumption of resulting trust operates, but to extend the presumption of advancement to presume a joint tenancy in equity where the joint tenants are spouses. This extension ensures that legal and beneficial ownership of the property is unified in the surviving spouse upon the other spouse’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Where the operation of the presumption of advancement is considered between joint tenants who are parent and child rather than spouses, there is no basis for extending the presumption as the Court of Appeal did in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>. There is no equivalent reason to presume that a parent who purchases property with a child and who makes an unequally large contribution to the purchase of the property intends a joint tenancy in equity, rather than a tenancy in common in equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [105] is not authority that the presumption of advancement is capable in all contexts of applying to the right of survivorship separately from its application to a life interest. For the reasons I have given, it is my view that the extension to the presumption of advancement in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> does not apply outside the spousal context. It therefore does not assist the defendant in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Even if the extension to the presumption of advancement does operate in the defendant’s favour, I consider that any presumption of advancement that has arisen in respect of the right of survivorship arises only weakly and has been rebutted on the facts of this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Presumption of advancement is rebutted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The strength with which the presumption of advancement arises in any given case will vary with the circumstances of the case, particularly the nature and state of the relationship between the parties. Where the presumption of advancement is weak, less weighty evidence will be required to rebut it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the context of a parent-child relationship, the number of children the parent has is a factor that weakens the strength with which the presumption arises. The more children a parent has, the less basis there will be to presume that the parent’s transfer of property of substantial value to a single child was intended to be a gift to that child: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [68]. Another factor is the plausibility of the parent’s intention to make a gift having regard to the financial status of the parties at the relevant time: <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni and another v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy) and another</span> [2020] SGCA 58 at [5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The presumption of advancement arises in this case only weakly. The Father had four children. This attenuates any basis for presuming that the Father intended to benefit only one of the four children. Moreover, at the time the Property was purchased, the defendant was financially independent and his income was on an upward trajectory while the Father was in straitened financial circumstances and his income had almost certainly plateaued. This attenuates any basis for presuming that the Father intended to benefit the defendant in particular out of his four children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Given the weakness with which the presumption of advancement arises, the evidence in this case suffices to rebut it. I accept the plaintiffs’ case that the Father and the Mother treated all four of their children equally, regardless of their sex. I find that both parents did not favour the defendant, as their only son, over their daughters as may have been typical for parents of their generation and culture. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Mother’s conduct is an indication of how the parents treated their children. The Mother left her assets (excluding the family home and sums in joint bank accounts with each child) to the four children in equal shares.

</div> If anything, the Mother’s conduct showed an intention to favour the daughters over sons in that the Mother left the family home to a daughter. Furthermore, the Mother appointed one of her daughters, the first plaintiff, to be her executrix of her will rather than her only son. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Mother’s intention is, in a sense, one step removed from the Father’s. Her treatment of their four children cannot be conclusive as to the Father’s intention to treat his four children equally regardless of sex. But the Mother’s conduct is a basis from which to draw an inference about the Father’s intention and, in particular, whether the Father could have intended to benefit the defendant alone with an interest in the Property. I find that he could not have intended to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I also consider it important that the Business operated from the Property. The Father managed the business, initially jointly with his own father and from 1985 as sole proprietor. The defendant was not involved in running the Business. The Father knew this. After the Father’s death in December 2016, it was the Mother and not the defendant who took over the Business as its sole proprietor. This adds important colour to the Father’s likely intentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The defendant’s case is that he – as the only son of the family – was the Father’s favoured child. He submits that the Father purchased an insurance policy and nominated the defendant as the beneficiary but not any of the plaintiffs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I therefore find that the extension to the presumption of advancement in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, even if it arises as between a parent and child and not just as between spouses, has been rebutted. The presumption of resulting trust accordingly remains unrebutted. The defendant therefore held the Property on trust for the Father from the time it was purchased in 1995. For the reasons set out above, it follows that the defendant now holds the Property on trust for the four siblings in equal shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Given that I have found in favour of the plaintiffs on their primary case relying on a resulting trust, I do not need to analyse their alternative case relying on a constructive trust.  It suffices for me to find that there is no evidence that the Father and the defendant formed the common intention necessary for a constructive trust in favour of the Father at the time the Property was purchased in 1995. Further, there is no evidence that the defendant and the plaintiffs formed the common intention necessary for a constructive trust in favour of the plaintiffs at the family meetings in August 2017. In any event, the plaintiffs have not established any detrimental reliance on their part on any common intention that the parties may have formed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I have accepted the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant holds the Property on a resulting trust for the four siblings in equal shares. In doing so, I have rejected the defendant’s defence. The defendant’s counterclaim is simply a mirror of the plaintiffs’ claim and falls with his defence. The counterclaim is accordingly dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I now deal with the issue of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The general rule is that costs follow the event: O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The event in this action is favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are therefore <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to recover the costs of this action from the defendant. The defendant accepts this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The plaintiffs claim $149,000 as a reasonable amount for the costs they have reasonably incurred in this action. The defendant submits that the costs payable to the plaintiffs should be reduced by 30% because the plaintiffs’ claims in constructive trust did not succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Notwithstanding the defendant’s submission, I have allowed the plaintiff’s party and party costs at $149,000. I make two observations. First, the court’s discretion to depart from the general rule of awarding costs to the successful party should be exercised judicially: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd and another</span> [2022] 5 SLR 525 (“<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>”) at [42]. The general rule does not cease to operate simply because a successful party has raised issues or made allegations that have failed. Something more, such as a significant increase in the length of proceedings or raising issues unreasonably, is required in order to warrant depriving a successful party of part of its costs: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span> at [45]–[47]; <span class="font-italic">Tullio Planeta v </span><span class="font-italic">Maoro Andrea G</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 501 at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Elgindata Ltd (No 2) </span>[1993] 1 WLR 1207 at 1214. Second, the touchstone for the recoverability of costs is reasonableness: <span class="font-italic">EFG Bank AG, Singapore Branch v </span><span class="font-italic">Surewin Worldwide Ltd and others</span> [2022] SGHC 26 at [13].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In my view, there should be no deduction from the plaintiffs’ costs of this action because the plaintiffs failed to establish a constructive trust. Those claims were not raised unreasonably and did not result in a significant lengthening of the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Thus, I award $149,000 to the plaintiffs as the costs (excluding disbursements) of and incidental to this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In summary, I have entered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in this action to the following effect:
