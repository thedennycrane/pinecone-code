It financed its import of stock mostly through trade financing facilities granted by banks. Typically, lending banks would disburse funds directly to the relevant supplier of stock upon being furnished with proof of the Company’s purchase. As security for the loan, the Company would pledge the shipping documents (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the bill of lading) for the financed stock to the relevant bank. Thereafter, to enable the Company to sell the stock to its end-customers, the bank would release the relevant shipping documents to the Company. In consideration for this release, the Company would execute a trust receipt on terms that the Company held the financed stock or its proceeds of sale on trust for the bank. The trust receipts typically identified the financed stock with reference to their corresponding bill of lading number, invoice number and/or a description of the financed stock.

Chong J found that the gross sale proceeds of the pepper stock should be paid (in proportions to be resolved separately) to those defendants who could assert a security interest in the underlying stock which they financed, save for the proceeds for four categories of pepper stock (“the Disputed Categories”) in which the general creditors were also entitled to assert an interest in certain quantities of the stock.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This brings me to the present application, where the parties sought a determination on the method of distribution to be adopted for the sales proceeds of the Disputed Categories of pepper. The underlying legal question is this: when assets commingled into a mixed bulk are insufficient to satisfy all claims made in respect of the said assets by claimants (none of whom is a wrongdoer towards another) who have a security interest in them, what method of distribution should be used? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The various methods of distribution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>The foreign case authorities have identified a number of possible approaches to the distribution of mixed funds where such funds are insufficient to satisfy every claim. This includes the “first in, first out” approach, the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> approach (or what the Liquidators termed as the single-block method) and the rolling charge approach (or what the Liquidators termed as the multi-block method). The parties had confirmed that they were not advocating for the “first in, first out” method. The second defendant, Bank of Baroda, submitted that the rolling charge method should be used whilst the fifth and sixth defendants, DBS Bank Ltd and Indian Bank, argued for the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method to be applied. The rest of the defendants, whilst they had previously informed the Liquidators of their preferred approach, did not attend and make submissions in court. The Liquidators maintained a neutral position although they supported the rolling charge method. In the Annex to this Grounds of Decision, I have inserted a table (produced by the Liquidators and not disputed by the defendants) illustrating how the selection of the method of distribution affects the defendants’ share of the sale proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>Having heard the submissions, I determined that the rolling charge method, rather than the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method, should be adopted. Given the paucity in local case authority on this issue, it would be useful to discuss the various methods that the courts have considered before coming to the reasons for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “first in, first out” method</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>The “first in, first out” approach was set out in <span class="font-italic">Devaynes v Noble </span>[1814-23] All ER Rep 1, more commonly known as <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case</span>. Essentially, “when sums are mixed in a bank account as a result of a series of deposits, withdrawals are treated as withdrawing the money in the same order as the money was deposited” (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liq) and others v Vaughan and others </span>[1992] 4 All ER 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span>”) at 35). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>The scope of application for the rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is rather limited. For one, it is questionable whether it has any application out of a banker-customer relationship (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 44; <span class="font-italic">Re Diplock’s Estate, Diplock v Wintle </span>[1948] 1 Ch 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Diplock</span>”) at 555; <span class="font-italic">Re Ontario Securities Commission and Greymac Credit Corp </span>(1986) 55 OR (2d) 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Greymac</span>”) at 688). In <span class="font-italic">Q &amp; M Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh Kiat </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Q &amp; M</span><span class="font-italic"> Enterprises</span>”) at [56], Andrew Phang JC (as he then was) observed that the rule was applied almost invariably in the context of running accounts as such accounts are, <span class="font-italic">ceteris paribus</span>, ideal situations for the application of the rule. While Phang JC posits that there was no reason to treat any debtor-creditor relationship involving a running or current account differently, he also notes the judicial limitation of the applicability of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case</span>, which can be attributed to the rule’s perceived arbitrariness. The effect of the rule is that it favours later contributors over earlier contributors. Citing the dicta of Learned Hand J in <span class="font-italic">Re Walter J Schmidt &amp; Co, ex p Feuerbach </span>(1923) 298 F 314 at 316, Woolf LJ in <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>agreed that the fiction of the “first in, first out” method apportioned a “common misfortune through a test which has no relation whatever to the justice of the case”, and that it led to “capricious consequences” (at 35). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>It is observed that the courts have in various subsequent cases distinguished or disapplied the rule in<span class="font-italic"> Clayton’s Case</span> in favour of a method that would produce a more just and equitable outcome. In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Diplock</span>, Lord Greene MR characterised the rule as “really a rule of convenience based on so-called presumed intention” (at 554). In <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span>, Woolf LJ held (at [42]) that if the application of the rule would be impracticable or result in injustice between the investors it will not be applied if there is a preferable alternative or if the application of the rule would be contrary to the express, inferred or presumed intention of the investors. In <span class="font-italic">Russell-Cooke Trust Co v Prentis </span>[2003] 2 All ER 478 at [55], Lindsay J, in rejecting the use of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case</span> and adopting the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method instead, held that the modern approach in England is not “to challenge the binding nature of the rule but rather to permit it to be distinguished by the reference to the facts of the particular case”, and for the rule to be “displaced by even a slight counterweight” such that it would be more accurate to call it the <span class="font-italic">exception </span>(rather than the rule) in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’</span><span class="font-italic">s Case</span><span style="color: rgba(0,176,80,1)">. </span>Phang JC suggested at [56] in <span class="font-italic">Q &amp; M Enterprises</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the rule could be an “evidential presumption and no more”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>It also bears mention that the rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case </span>would be displaced when there are mixed funds made up of contributions from a beneficiary and a fiduciary, as the operative presumption would be the one that works best in favour of the claimant and against the fiduciary (Graham Virgo, <span class="font-italic">Principles of the Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2015) at 622, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Hallett’s Estate </span>(1880) 13 Ch D 696 and <span class="font-italic">Re Oatway </span>[1903] 2 Ch 356). Finally, whether <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case </span>is even applicable in the context of tracing remains unresolved (for differing views, see <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 44; <span class="font-italic">Q &amp; M Enterprises </span>at [56]; <span class="font-italic">Greymac</span> at 684; <span class="font-italic">O’Connor Rosamund Monica v Potter Derek John </span>[2011] 3 SLR 294 at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>The cases therefore suggest that save for exceptional cases, the rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case</span> is not the appropriate method to be applied to the resolution of claims made by multiple claimants with security interests in a commingled fund, and that an alternative method which produces a more just outcome should be applied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold">pari passu</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and rolling charge</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> methods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>The second and third methods – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>method (or the <span class="font-italic">pari passu ex post facto </span>method) and the rolling charge method (also known as the “North American” method) – are related, and it would be convenient to discuss them together. Although the parties have used the expressions “single-block approach” and “multi-block approach” respectively, I will nevertheless refer to the “<span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method” and “rolling charge method” in line with the body of decided cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>The <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method involves the <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>sharing of the total pool of assets according to what each of the claimants are owed, ignoring the dates on which they have made their respective investment or contribution (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 36). The rolling charge method treats the commingled fund as a blend or cocktail of credits made at different times and from different sources with the result that “when a withdrawal is made from the account it is treated as a withdrawal in the same proportions as the different interests in the account (here of the investors) bear to each other at the moment before the withdrawal is made” (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 35). Both methods are similar in approach in that calculations are done on a <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>basis. However, the rolling charge method requires that the contributor’s rateable interest in the mixed fund <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the other contributors be recalculated at <span class="font-italic">every instance of withdrawal</span>, whereas the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method only requires that all available assets be divided on a <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>basis<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">at the point of distribution</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>Given that the rolling charge method takes into account the rateable interests of each contributor to the mixed fund immediately before any withdrawal, it is more precise and is deemed to produce “the most just result” (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 35). An application of the <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>method may potentially be unfair to the most recent contributors as they may have their interests in the fund diminished by withdrawals <span class="font-italic">prior</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to their contribution (<span class="font-italic">Boughner v Greyhawk</span><span class="font-italic"> Equity Partners Limited Partnership (Millenium)</span> 111 OR (3d) 700 (“<span class="font-italic">Boughner v Greyhawk</span>”) at [92]; see generally <span class="font-italic">Shalson v Russo</span> [2005] Ch 281 at [149]–[150]). The rolling charge obviates this potential unfairness as it favours neither the earlier nor the more recent contributors (whereas the “first in, first out” method favours the latter) at the expense of the other group (Lynton Tucker <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) at para 41-071; <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton: Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees </span>(David Hayton gen ed) (LexisNexis, 19th Ed, 2016) at paras 90.34–90.35).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>That said, the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method is often preferred for considerations of costs, practicality and relative simplicity in implementation (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 27, 35 and 44; <span class="font-italic">Charity Commission for England and Wales v Framjee and others </span>[2015] 1 WLR 16 (“<span class="font-italic">Charity Commission</span>”) at [48] and [54]; <span class="font-italic">Greymac</span> at 688–689). And although there is some element of rough justice for the most recent contributors to the fund, the courts have reasoned that this is part and parcel of the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>method which “responds to a very basic human feeling that, when faced by a common misfortune, all those affected by it should bear the burden equally” (<span class="font-italic">Charity Commission </span>at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The choice between the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">pari passu</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> and the rolling charge methods</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>In my view, the rolling charge method should be preferred unless it is impracticable or unworkable (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>at 42; <span class="font-italic">Boughner v Greyhawk</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84])<span class="font-italic">.</span> In <span class="font-italic">Boughner </span><span class="font-italic">v Greyhawk</span>, the Ontario Supreme Court of Justice was concerned with the distribution of commingled funds to 24 victims of a fraudulent investment scheme. On the facts, the receiver had determined that it was able to make the accurate calculations to distribute the funds by using the rolling charge method. The court ordered the funds to be distributed on that basis as “justice dictates that the funds should be distributed proportionately based on the interests of the parties at the time of commingling” (at [91]–[93]). In rejecting the <span class="font-italic">pro rata ex post facto </span>distribution method (or what is essentially the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method), the court commented (at [92]) that this method would not have resulted in a fair outcome as the earlier investors had already lost over 88% of their investment value by the time the more recent investors came on board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>Even in respect of cases where the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method is applied, it has been acknowledged that the rolling charge method would have been adopted had it been practicable to do so. In <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span>, following the collapse of a Gibraltar deposit-taking company (“BCI”) and related entities, 11,000 investors were owed monies in excess of £100m, and the English Court of Appeal was confronted with the task of distributing monies and assets that were available for distribution. In deciding on the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method, Woolf LJ observed (at 42) that “[i]f the North American solution is practical this would probably have advantages over the pari passu solution”; but on the facts, the complications of applying the rolling charge method meant that the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method had to be used. Leggatt LJ also accepted that the fairness of the rolling charge method was “obvious” but the required calculations in <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span> proved too difficult and expensive (at 44). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Charity Commission</span>, an unincorporated charitable trust operated a website that facilitated charitable giving by members of the public by inviting them to make donations to the trust for the benefit of charities of their choice. An inquiry into the trust revealed a substantial shortfall between the funds held by the trust and the amounts due unpaid to the designated charities. One of the determinations that the Charity Commission sought from the court was a direction as to the most appropriate method of distributing the funds. Henderson J applied the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method even though he had earlier commented, citing <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span>, that the rolling charge method was likeliest to produce a fair and just result and he was prepared to proceed on the assumption that it was open to him to adopt the rolling charge method if he were satisfied that it provided a fairer result than either “first in, first out” or <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> distribution (at [54]). In rejecting the rolling charge method, Henderson J recognised that the problem faced was that of impracticability in the reconstruction of the raw data which would be needed in the absence of any adequate computerised record keeping by the unincorporated charitable trust (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>In my judgment, the rolling charge method is the method that would likely produce a fairer and more equitable result compared to the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method, all other things equal. It should therefore be preferred, unless it is impracticable for whatever reason to adopt and subject to considerations such as the intention of the parties as regards methods of distribution (including an agreement to a particular method of distribution). I turn to discuss the significance of parties’ intentions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ intentions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>A key consideration relevant for the court’s determination on the appropriate method to adopt is the parties’ intentions, whether express, inferred or presumed. Where there is an express agreement as to the method of distribution, such agreement would be given effect to unless it was unworkable or impracticable to do so. In the absence of such agreement, the court will look at the parties’ presumed intentions, which are to be gleaned from the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span>, Woolf LJ relied on the parties’ presumed intentions to reject the “first in, first out” method, and to adopt the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method instead. He found that contributions were intended to be made in respect of a “collective investment scheme”; and even if BCI (the deposit-taking company) was under an obligation to create separate funds for each investor, the presumed intentions of the investors would have been that what could be salvaged as a result of the “common misfortune” should be dealt with in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> approach, instead of being subjected to the vagaries of chance that follow from applying a “first in, first out” principle (at 41). Leggatt LJ echoed this analysis in his judgment, emphasising that “[t]he court goes by what must be presumed to have been the intention of the investors” (<span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 46).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Re International Investment Unit Trust </span>[2005] 1 NZLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Re IIUT</span>”), a fund for humanitarian, aid, health and education (“the IIUT”) was set up. Investors were promised rates of return in the order of 60–72% per annum. As time went on, funds contributed by later investors were disbursed to provide returns to earlier investors. Statutory managers were appointed for the trust and it was discovered that the total value of the assets fell far short of the claims to the trust. The court decided that the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> approach should be adopted to distribute the funds left in the IIUT. This was partly because it would have been too cost-prohibitive to implement the rolling charge method (at [36]). But Williams J also looked into the nature of the investments which provided an indication of the parties’ intentions. He made the following observations. First, the investors knew that similar returns were offered to all, and that investments were to be repayable on maturity. The investors must have known that their funds were at risk and there would be the possibility of loss or diminution in the value of their investment. They must also have contemplated that their funds may be used to repay the earlier investors in the IIUT (at [74] and [75]). Secondly, the investment accounts were managed in a pattern-less manner and this indicated that all of the funds held by the statutory manager should be available to all the investors. Furthermore, during the critical period, withdrawals from the accounts arose not from direct action by the investors but from the choice of the managers of the accounts. It was therefore unrealistic to apply the rolling charge method (at [76] and [77]). Finally, all the investors chose the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method to be used for calculations prior to 1 March 2003, the date from which placements of their investments were made (at [81]). Williams J concluded that the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method would be most appropriate, and would be most compatible with the analysis on presumed intentions in <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes</span> (at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>The principle to be gleaned from <span class="font-italic">Re IIUT</span> and <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>is that the parties’ intentions are a key consideration to bear in mind when selecting the appropriate method of distribution. To ascertain what the parties’ intentions are, the terms and structure of the contribution or investment will be indicative, though all the circumstances of the case should be taken into account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>To summarise, the principles to be applied in a situation where there are multiple claimants to a pool of commingled assets that is insufficient to satisfy every claim are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>The scope of application for the “first in, first out” rule in <span class="font-italic">Clayton’s Case </span>is limited and can be displaced by a slight counterweight.

Where practicable and subject to considerations such as the intention of the parties or any agreement to a particular method of distribution, the rolling charge method is to be preferred to the <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>method as the former more accurately reflects the parties’ interests in the mixed fund. In the usual case, the rolling charge method produces a result that is more just as the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method might occasion unfairness to the most recent contributors to the mixed fund. There may, however, be situations in which the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> approach is more suitable – for instance, where it would be too complicated or costly to apply a rolling charge approach because of a prohibitively large number of claimants or transactions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>The parties’ intentions are an important overarching consideration.

</div> According to the evidence of a Sea-shore warehouseman working in that warehouse, one Mr Shatik, there was no system as to how incoming stock was stored. Stock of the same description was stored together in various unmarked locations within the warehouse (hence, the bags of pepper under the four Disputed Categories should be handled as four distinct mixed bulks). At each location, there would be one or multiple stacks of stock of similar description.

Mr Shatik was the warehouseman on the ground and he would have a better understanding and recollection of how the warehouse operated. Mr Shatik’s evidence also seemed to be the likelier version because pictures of the warehouse showed numerous stacks – many of which were not very tall and suggested that new stacks had to be made continuously and existing stacks had to be rearranged.

The fifth defendant’s submission is neither here nor there because any suggestion that the warehouse dealt with shipments in and out of the warehouse on a “last in, first out” basis not only militates against the adoption of the rolling charge method, but the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>I turn to the fifth and sixth defendants’ second point: the evidential uncertainty regarding the sequence of same-day entries in the warehouse ledger.

If the incoming shipment of 1,000 bags on 26 September 2015 came after the two outgoing shipments of 500 bags each, the results obtained by using the rolling charge method would differ. This problem arose for multiple days across the three categories mentioned. Doubts about the sequence of the transfers seemed especially serious since Mr Shatik had deposed in his affidavit that he does not immediately record a delivery every time the stock arrives or leaves the warehouse because of time constraints, and it was not uncommon to update the ledger only after a few days.

</div> Given the foregoing, I did not see the second point as an insuperable difficulty making it impracticable or unrealistic to apply the rolling charge method. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Re IIUT</span>, Williams J observed at [25] that there would be difficulties and inequities regardless of the method chosen. Hence, even if there were minor inaccuracies in the ledger entries in the present case, such inaccuracies would not have tilted the balance in favour of the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>where there were 11,000 investors to distribute to, and <span class="font-italic">Charity Commission </span>where the required raw data could not even be reconstructed, the parties in the present case shared considerable common ground and were even able to agree on a set of figures to be paid out depending on the method used. It could scarcely be said that it would be impracticable to apply the rolling block method in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>I turn now to the third and final point raised by the fifth and sixth defendants: that the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> method would be the most just and equitable way to distribute the sale proceeds amongst the financing banks which were victims of a common misfortune. The fifth defendant submits that this is borne out by the fact that the terms of the trust receipts did not <span class="font-italic">clearly</span> require segregation of stock and that the defendants’ ignorance about the warehousing system meant that they were “indifferent to whether the self-same bags the subject of the original bills of lading they received were delivered out of the warehouse against their own trust receipt”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the bags of pepper were treated as fungible.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>In my view, the choice between the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> and rolling charge methods cannot simply be resolved by referencing Woolf LJ’s holding that the presumed intentions of victims to a “common misfortune” would be to deal with what is salvaged on a <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>basis. The competing method he considered was the “first in, first out” principle, and his holding was directed at the “vagaries of chance” that the “first in, first out” principle subject claimants to. It should be highlighted that the court in <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>seemed ready to implement the rolling charge method, had it been practicable for them to do so. In the present context, where the two competing methods are the <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> and rolling charge methods, <span class="font-italic">Re IIUT </span>provides a more helpful comparison. The present case is very different from a situation where the claimants are investors to a joint investment fund like the IIUT. Contrary to the submissions of the fifth defendant, the financing banks expressly tried to set themselves apart from each other. In <span class="font-italic">Pars Ram</span>, Chong J noted that the second defendant’s and the fifth defendant’s trust receipts contained an obligation to hold and store the goods in the bank’s names or to pay the proceeds of sale of the underlying goods into a designated account. Moreover, the sixth defendant’s trust receipt contained an express term stating that the Company should hold or store the goods in a manner capable of separate identification (<span class="font-italic">Pars Ram </span>at [2(b)]). Even though these terms may not have been complied with, the Company’s breach is irrelevant for ascertaining the financing banks’ intention, and the terms used in the trust receipts point towards a finding that the creditors did not intend to weather this “common misfortune” on a <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>For the above reasons, I ordered that the rolling charge method be used in respect of sales proceeds for all of the Disputed Categories, in accordance with what is set out in the Annex.
